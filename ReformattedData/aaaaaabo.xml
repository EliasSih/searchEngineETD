This thesis investigates academics&#8217; insights and experiences about their changing teacher identities in the context of being, or becoming, a facilitator of online student learning. This was an empirical research project, a collective case study that explored the teaching experiences of twelve university lecturers in two Australian universities who taught online, or were making the move online. Primary research data were drawn from semi-structured conversations with the lecturers, online teaching artefacts and email communications. The interpretative analysis was organised according to three overlapping lecturer identities: the teaching metaphors of performance, care and creative direction. From the perspective of each metaphor position, the move to becoming a facilitator of blended learning was uneasy. The performer/carer/director lecturer struggled to entertain, care and intervene in familiar ways in asynchronous, computer-mediated communication. Online, the performing/caring/directing lecturer was ignored by students, and became instead a helpless and highly reflexive bystander to students&#8217; learning. The findings suggest that the teaching values and practices of the performing/caring/directing lecturer, in particular lecturer-student responsiveness and reciprocity, do not adapt to online pedagogies. Indeed, blended learning establishes the conditions for a new moral order in university education, with the move to online facilitation best understood as a move to management-centred regulation of teaching and student learning. And so, overlooked in higher education policy and research, and ignored by her students online, the performing/caring/directing lecturer is under erasure, at the same time as the work of the facilitator is being archived.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lecturer.</field><field name="subject">Technology.</field><field name="subject">Teaching.</field><field name="subject">Academics.</field><field name="subject">Internet.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/391</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Falling behind': a grounded theory of uncritical decision making.</field><field name="creator">Pratt, Jonathan Gordon MacLeod</field><field name="description">University of Technology, Sydney.

Six species of the genus Pseudomugil, and the related Scaturiginichthys venneilipinnis, are found on the Australian continent. The normal breeding behaviour, egg surface morphology and embryology of four species of Pseudomugil (P. signijer, P. genrudae, P. tenellus and P. mellis) were first investigated, using aquarium and microscopic (light and S.E.M.) studies. The four species were divided into two groups: P. signifer and P. mellis; and P. tenellus and P. gertrudae. The study provided further evidence for the view that the embryology of the genus Pseudomugil differs markedly from that of members of the family Melanotaeniidae, with which the pseudomugilids have previously been grouped. The seasonal pattern of gonadal function in P. signifer, both in the field and in aquariums, was then investigated for populations of P. signifer from the Sydney region. It was found that P. signifer bred over the spring and summer months, commencing breeding as the temperature and daylength increased, and declining in breeding activity as daylength and temperature declined. There was no substantial difference in the pattern of reproductive activity between wild and captive stocks of P. signifer in the populations used. The impact of the presence of the introduced G. holbrooki on P. signifer was then examined, first in open-air tank experiments , and then in the field. In the tank experiments the exotic species profoundly affected the breeding of the native species. When G. holbrooki were in the tanks P. signifer did not gain weight or grow in total length (except for females given supplementary feed); ovarian weight and fecundity was greatly reduced and the ovaries were morphologically undeveloped. No eggs from P. signifer were observed in tanks which also housed G. holbrooki. G. holbrooki were observed to actively hunt and eat young P. signifer and to nip the caudal fins of adult P. signifer. The results indicate clearly, that at least in a captive situation, the presence of the exotic species has a very deleterious effect on breeding and hence possible survival, of a native population. A pilot study conducted at the same time as the harvest of the second tank study did not reveal such drastic consequences. However, even in the less confined field situation, some evidence of an interrelation between water quality, numbers of P. signifer and numbers of G. holbrooki were seen in one disturbed site (Home bush Bay). These findings suggest that a newly designed field experiment based on data collected from the power analysis of the pilot study could clarify whether G. holbrooki adversely affects P. signifer in the wild. The information gained from these studies can be used in the management of P. signifer in the wild, and serve as a model of the possible effects upon other native species.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pacific blue-eye.</field><field name="subject">Eastern gambusia.</field><field name="subject">Freshwater fishes.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/955</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The experiences of midwives involved with the development and implementation of CenteringPregnancy at two hospitals in Australia.</field><field name="creator">Teate, Alison Judith</field><field name="description">Aims : The aims of the study were to describe the experiences of the midwives who were part of the first Australian CenteringPregnancy Pilot Study and to inform the future development of CenteringPregnancy.

A pilot study that explored the feasibility of implementing CenteringPregnancy in Australia was undertaken in 2006-2008.

Method : An Action Research approach was undertaken to study the implementation of CenteringPregnancy in Australia. This included a qualitative descriptive study to describe and explore the experiences of the midwives who were participants. The study was set in two hospital antenatal clinics and two outreach community health-care centres in southern Sydney. Eight midwives and three research team members formed the Action Research group. Data collected were primarily from focus groups and surveys and were analysed using simple descriptive statistics and thematic content analysis. Findings : CenteringPregnancy enabled midwives to develop relationships with the women in their groups and with their peers in the Action Research group. The group antenatal care model enhanced the development of relationships between midwives and women that were necessary for professional fulfilment and the appreciation of relationship-based care. The use of supportive organisational change, enabled by Action Research methods, facilitated midwives to develop new skills that were appropriate for the group care setting and in line with a strengths-based approach. Issues of low staffing rates, lack of available facilities for groups, time constraints, recruitment difficulties and resistance to change impacted on widespread implementation of CenteringPregnancy. Conclusions : The experience of the midwives who provided CenteringPregnancy care suggests that it is an appropriate model of care for the Australian midwifery context, particularly if organisational support and recruitment strategies and access to appropriate facilities are addressed. The midwives who undertook CenteringPregnancy engaged in a new way of working that enhanced their appreciation of relationship-based care and was positive to their job satisfaction. Implications for practice Effective ways to implement CenteringPregnancy models of care in Australia were identified in this study. These included a system of support for the midwives engaging in facilitating groups for the first time. It is important that organisations also develop other supportive strategies, including the provision of adequate group spaces, effective recruitment plans and positive support systems for change management. In the light of current evidence the development of continuity of care models which enhance the relationship between an individual women and her midwife, it is important to explore the effects of group care on this unique relationship.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CenteringPregnancy.</field><field name="subject">Pregnancy.</field><field name="subject">Antenatal care.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Potential for phytoremediation of a metalliferous mine site at Mt.

However with increasing human pressures, many estuaries along the coastline of Australia have become degraded. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the effects of estuarine metal contaminants on the physiology, and the subsequent accumulation, in the smooth toadfish, Tetractenos glaber, and their prey items in estuaries in the Sydney region, south eastern Australia. Toadfish and sediments were collected during three seasonal sampling periods (June 2002, September 2002 and January 2003) in four estuaries in the Sydney region (Port Hacking River, Cowan Creek, Parramatta River and Lake Macquarie). Sediment and toadfish tissue metal concentrations varied both spatially and temporally, with highest concentrations exhibited in the metal contaminated estuaries (Lake Macquarie and Parramatta River) during spring 2002 and summer 2003. Toadfish accumulated metals in different tissue, however field experiments were limited in determining the main pathways of accumulation. Controlled laboratory kinetic experiments using radioisotopes of 109Cd and 75Se, indicated that differences in the relative contributions of water and food in the accumulation of these metals are generally governed by the physiology of the toadfish and the type of prey eaten. The distribution of metals in fish organs is important for better understanding metal kinetics and their subsequent toxicity. Toadfish exposed to 109Cd in both water or food showed a shift in distribution from gut lining at the end of the uptake phase to the excretory organs, such as liver, by the end of the loss phase, suggesting that the main uptake pathway for water exposure was via the gut and not the gills, due to fish drinking large amounts of water to maintain osmoregulation. There was no appreciable shift in the distribution of 75Se from the uptake or loss phases, being mostly associated with the excretory organs (gills, liver and kidneys). Further investigation into the accumulation of metals in toadfish prey items revealed that differences in uptake and loss of 109Cd and 75Se were influenced by their aqueous speciation, as well as differences in animal physiology, sequestration, storage and excitation mechanisms. The uptake rates and CFs of 109Cd and 75Se were highest, and the biological half-lives the longest, in pygmy mussels, ghost shrimps and polychaetes relative to the semaphore and soldier crabs. Elevated metal concentrations in certain toadfish tissues from the four estuaries were linked to reduced lipid concentrations and increased protein concentrations, which may be detrimental for growth, reproductive output and survivorship of the fish. A closer investigation into the nutritional value and metal concentrations of toadfish prey items in a selected metal contaminated estuary (Parramatta River) revealed that toadfish from the more contaminated sites within the estuary may grow faster due to higher nutritional value of prey items on a local scale, however on a larger spatial scale, this was not evident. Further investigation is required to determine whether larger toadfish size can be attributed to physiological acclimation or genetic resistance through generations of continuous metal exposure. Many studies have assessed metal concentrations in water, sediments and biota in the field, however few studies have combined both field and laboratory experiments to examine the effects of metals on fish physiology and reproduction, and metal transfer pathways in aquatic biota. This study has contributed to a better understanding of metal accumulation and its physiological effects in estuarine biota and highlights the high spatial and temporal variability in responses of organisms to environmental metal pollution.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heavy metals.</field><field name="subject">Estuarine biology.</field><field name="subject">Toadfishes.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1103</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Portfolio credit risk modelling and CDO pricing - analytics and implied trees from CDO tranches</field><field name="creator">Peng, Tao</field><field name="description">One of the most successful and most controversial innovative financial products in recent years has been collateralised debt obligations (CDOs). The dimensionality of dependency embedded in a typical CDO structure poses great challenges for researchers - in both generating realistic default dynamics and correlation, and in the mean time achieving fast and accurate model calibration. The research presented in this thesis contributes to the class of bottom-up models, which, as opposed to top-down models, start by modelling the individual obligor default process and then moving them up through the dependency structures to build up the loss distributions at the portfolio level. The Gaussian model (Li 2000) is a static copula model. It has only on correlation parameter, which can be calibrated to one CDO tranche at a time. Its simplicity achieves wide spread industry application even though it suffers from the problem of &#8217;correlation smile&#8217;. In other words, it cannot fit the market in an arbitrage-free manner in the capital-structure dimension. The first contribution of this thesis is the sensitivities analysis with regard to model parameters of expected losses of CDO tranches in the Gaussian and NIG copula models. The study provided substantial insight into the essence of the dependency structure. In addition, we apply the intensity approach to credit modelling in order to imply market distributions non-parametrically in the form of a binomial lattice. Under the same framework, we developed a series of three models. The static binomial model can be calibrated to the CDS index tranches exactly, with one set of parameters. The model can be seen as a non-parametric copula model that is arbitrage free in the capital-structure dimension. Static models are not suitable to price portfolio credit derivatives that are dynamic in nature. The static model can be naturally developed into a dynamic binomial model and satisfies no-arbitrage conditions in the time dimension. This setup, however, reduces model flexibility and calibration speed. The computational complexity comes from the non-Markovian character of the default process in the dynamic model. Inspired by Mortensen (2006), in which the author defines the intensity integral as a conditioning variable, we modify the dynamic model into a Markovian model by modelling the intensity integral directly, which greatly reduces the computational time and increases model fit in calibration. We also show that, when stochastic recovery rates are involved, there is a third no-arbitrage condition for the expected loss process that needs to be built into the Markovian model. For all binomial models, we adopt a unique optimisation algorithm for model calibration - the Cross Entropy method. It is particularly advantageous in solving large-scale non-linear optimsation problems with multiple local extrema, as encountered in our model.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Collateralised debt obligations.</field><field name="subject">Binomial coefficients.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1104</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Network controlled vertical handover for heterogeneous networks</field><field name="creator">Gami, Prashant Prabhulal</field><field name="description">Future wireless networks are expected to be a convergence of different wireless networks based on single Radio Access Technology. The aim is to provide seamless services to users any time from anywhere in the world using proper devices. In order to achieve this goal, seamless transition from one network to another with acceptable quality of service is required. Handover from one network to another is known as inter network or vertical handover. Currently known Mobile Controlled Vertical Handover schemes have some limitations. Mobile Station is limited with power and has very limited information about networks. Due to these limitations, Mobile Controlled Vertical Handover (MCVHO) can not achieve high performance in terms of hand over delay and handover decision. In this thesis, a new Network Controlled Vertical Handover (NCVHO) scheme is proposed. Proposed NCVHO scheme uses information which is available only to network along with information available to mobile node to enhance handover decision and reduce total number of handover and call dropping. NCVHO scheme also reduces the signaling on the wireless part of the network which reduces the usage of air interface. The scheme allows Point of Attachment (PoA) to make handover decision on behalf of mobile node which reduces signaling on the wireless part of the network. This change in a vertical handover scheme reduces signaling delay of the handover and achieves better handover delay performance. NCVHO scheme is reduces signaling on the air interface and uses more information to make handover decision which can achieve higher performance for number of handovers and call dropping than MCVHO. The price is paid as increased processing delay at the Point of Attachment (poA). Simulation in this thesis shows that NCVHO performance decreases at higher number of users in comparison with MCVHO. A solution to this problem is also proposed in this thesis with some modification to NCVHO scheme, a new network controlled vertical handover scheme called distributed Network Controlled Vertical Handover (distNCVHO) is proposed. The scheme achieves better performance than NCVHO scheme in terms of handover delay, number of handovers and call dropping. It is noticed in this thesis that more information available from the network can enhance handover decision which can in turn reduce total number of handovers with a large margin. Information such as network load, network properties such as coverage, available bandwidth can play a vital role in the handover decision making. Reduced usage of air interface can allow network to perform handover faster and reduce number of total handover attempts.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relative benefit of reliable heading updates on urban wayfinding</field><field name="creator">Waters, Wilfred</field><field name="description">Prior research about wayfinding has found that females tend to employ a single strategy based on landmarks, where males are more versatile, using a dual strategy of landmarks and global orientation information such as cardinal directions (Lawton, 2010). It was proposed that this difference occurs due to males&#8217; better sense of direction, which would deliver more trustworthy indications of current heading. Since males&#8217; versatility has often been linked with better navigation performance (for example Sandstrom, Kaufman, &amp; Huettel, 1998; Saucier et al., 2002) this study sought to contribute to the growing body of literature on methods of training to increase sense of direction (such as Hund and Minarik, 2006; Hund &amp; Nazarczuk, 2009). An experimental procedure was used to investigate the possibility that the provision of reliable cardinal direction heading updates to participants would lead to a dual strategy for orientation in those that usually use a single strategy based on landmarks. This was done in an urban navigation context, with the main dependent variable being level of recall for route structure. Using the Santa Barbara Sense of Direction Scale, the study revealed that males had a higher self-reported sense of direction than females.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wayfinding strategies, sense of direction, cardinal directions, navigation, sex differences</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/8505</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutrition of container grown plants with emphasis on the Proteaceae</field><field name="creator">Thomas, M. B.</field><field name="description">A range of Proteaceous shrubs and other nursery plants were grown in containers with soilless media and various N levels. Plants demonstrated a range of responsiveness. Supplying soilless media with Osmocote (26% N) and other short term fertilisers proved to be a satisfactory method of studying the comparative nutrition of a wide range of container grown nursery plants using factorial experiments incorporating N, P, K and lime. Nutrient response surfaces were obtained using a central composite incomplete block design.  Most Proteaceous shrubs were intolerant of high P levels due to excessive luxury consumption resulting in toxic foliar nutrient levels, especially in the presence of high N.  Phosphorus sensitivity in plants appeared to correspond with the soil nutrient levels in their native habitat. This applied to species studied in the 2 main sub-families in the Proteaceae while similar findings were indicated for other Australian genera.  A range of optimum N requirements in the Proteaceae was found &#8211; lowest needs for Protea which also had the greatest tolerance of very low fertiliser additions, compared to Grevillea robusta with much higher N requirements and strong foliage growth inhibition if nutrient levels are very low.  Proteoid root growth on Grevillea rosmarinifolia only occurred at low nutrient levels and was not required for satisfactory foliage growth of container grown plants.  Pot plants and seedlings, especially tomato, responded strongly to N and often there were positive NK interactions influencing foliage growth. Lime requirements were studied and in erica increasing lime rates depressed foliage growth.  Comparative nutrition studies indicate that general or broad spectrum container media may be unsuitable for some groups of nursery plants and that they could be replaced by potting mixes designed to meet the widely differing needs of the species often grown. The number of specialist mixes would depend on the range of plants and be governed by management considerations.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Proteaceae</field><field name="subject">soilless media</field><field name="subject">nutrients</field><field name="subject">container grown</field><field name="subject">fertiliser</field><field name="subject">070601 - Horticultural Crop Growth and Development</field><field name="subject">079902 - Fertilisers and Agrochemicals (incl.

Estimates of regional crop loss may be inaccurate if the relationship between disease and yield loss is affected by crop yield potential. The importance of crop yield potential in disease: yield loss modelling was investigated and models for more accurate regional crop loss estimates were developed, taking crop yield potential into account.  Two spring sown barley (cv. Triumph) experiments were conducted in 1987/88 and 1988/89 in Canterbury, New Zealand, to study the effect of crop yield potential on the relationship between disease and yield loss. Crop yield potentials of 323 to 806gDM/m&#178; were generated in seven crops by varying nitrogen and water inputs, sowing date (mid-spring and early-summer) and season. Leaf rust (Puccinia hordei Otth) epidemics of different severity were generated by applying fungicides at different times, frequencies and rates to control the natural epidemics. Disease was measured as per cent disease severity (%DS), green leaf area, radiation interception and near-infrared radiation (NIR) reflectance from crop canopies. Yield was measured as total and grain dry weight.  Epidemics were severe in the fully diseased plots from GS 34 and 46 to maturity in the late and early sown crops respectively. Disease reduced grain yield by 50 to 63% in 1987/88 and 24 to 38% in 1988/89 in the fully diseased plots.  Disease: yield loss models were derived by regression analysis for each crop in 1987/88. Single point, multiple point and area under curve models were derived from %DS and GLAI variables, and proportional (%) and actual (gDM/m&#178;) grain yield. The effect of yield potential was determined by comparing regression equation coefficients for each crop with crop yield potential. An area under green leaf area index curve (AUGLAIC): actual yield model was best suited to determining the effect of yield potential on yield loss. This model was selected because AUGLAIC summarised the effect of disease on plant growth over the season and actual yield represented the crop yield potential in the absence of disease and the response of actual yield to disease. Crop yield potential did not affect actual yield loss caused by leaf rust.  Disease measured as AUGLAIC explained most of the variation in yield (R&#178;adj=0.93) for all crops in both years. Assessment of GLAI is not suitable for estimation of regional crop loss because of the requirement for a rapid and low cost method. Reflectance of NIR from the crop canopy was investigated as an alternative to GLAI measurements. Reflectance was correlated significantly (P&lt;0.001) with GLAI (r=0.66 to 0.89) and green area index (r=0.76 to 0.92). Reflectance measured at grain-filling (GS 85-87) explained most (R&#178;adj=0.94) of the variation in yield for all crops in both years.  The relationship between AUGLAIC and yield was validated with data from independent diseased and healthy barley crops. The AUGLAIC: yield model described the effects of disease on yield accurately but overestimated yield by 49 to 108% in the healthy crops. Models based on accumulated PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) intercepted by green leaves explained the observed deviations in yield of these crops from the AUGLAIC: yield model. Accumulated PAR models accounted for differences in incident radiation, canopy structure, radiation interception by green leaves, radiation use efficiency and harvest index which are important in determining dry matter production and grain yield. Accumulated PAR models described the effects of disease on crop growth which were not represented by GLAI alone.  Variation in crop yield potential at the regional scale is important in disease: yield loss modelling and can be accounted for by using either separate equations for each yield potential crop or crop category, robust models, inclusion of a form function for yield potential or choice of disease and yield variables which integrate yield potential.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">barley</field><field name="subject">Hordeum vulgare L.</field><field name="subject">leaf rust</field><field name="subject">Puccinia hordei</field><field name="subject">yield loss assessment</field><field name="subject">yield potential</field><field name="subject">disease assessment</field><field name="subject">green leaf area</field><field name="subject">reflectance</field><field name="subject">disease models</field><field name="subject">060704 - Plant Pathology</field><field name="subject">070308 - Crop and Pasture Protection (Pests, Diseases and Weeds)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1980</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sireline variation in neonatal lamb cold tolerance</field><field name="creator">Gudex, B. W.</field><field name="description">The cost of lamb mortality caused by cold exposure has been estimated at approximately 40 million dollars per year. This value is probably conservative as it does not include the cost due to the reduction in productivity in hypothermic lambs that manage to survive or the cost of reduced selection potential incurred by fewer lambs surviving until selection. The objectives of this research was to investigate whether sire-line variation exists in neonatal lamb cold tolerance and whether polymorphism in the &#946;&#8323; adrenergic receptor gene can be used as a genetic marker for lamb cold tolerance and lean muscle growth. The influence of the climate, birthweight, age of dam at lambing, gender and birth rank on neonatal lamb cold tolerance was also analysed. Neonatal lamb mortality due to cold exposure was analysed in four field trials that used neonatal lamb morality from cold exposure as a predictor of neonatal lamb cold tolerance. Sire-line variation in neonatal lamb morality was observed in all trials, though it appeared that this effect was largely mediated through sire-line variation in lamb birth weight. Variation in lamb birth weight between birth rank classed was also found to be responsible for the influence of birth rank on neonatal lamb mortality due to cold exposure. The age of dam at lambing and the lamb gender was not observed to influence neonatal lamb mortality due to cold exposure. The sires from the cold tolerance study and the progeny of the lean muscle growth study were genotyped for the &#946;&#8323; adrenergic receptor locus. Other studies have found evidence that a major gene exists in the catecholamine stimulation of brown adipose thermogenesis and evidence that the &#946;&#8323;-AR gene is a likely candidate. However, this hypothesis and the hypothesis that polymorphism in the &#946;&#8323;-AR gene is also linked to lean muscle growth in lambs was not confirmed in this study. So while it appears that the results were confounded by experimental design, there is evidence that influence of polymorphism in the ovine &#946;&#8323; AR gene on neonatal lamb mortality and/or lean muscle growth is not sufficient to be considered a major gene effect. The implications of this experiment on the sheep industry and sheep farmers in general are huge. While completely eliminating lamb deaths due to inadequate cold tolerance is impossible, this study shows that large gains in lamb survival could be possible through selective breeding.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sheep</field><field name="subject">Ovis aries</field><field name="subject">cold tolerance</field><field name="subject">lean muscle growth</field><field name="subject">birthweight</field><field name="subject">&#946;&#8323;-adrenergic receptor</field><field name="subject">Beta3 adrenergic receptor</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1055</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determining seed vigour in selected Brassica species</field><field name="creator">Leeks, C. R. F.</field><field name="description">Variables for the accelerated ageing (AA) test, methods for reducing fungal contamination during the AA test, using the conductivity test as a vigour test, the effect of seed size on seed vigour and the relationship between laboratory test results and field perfonnance in selected Brassica spp were investigated. In the first experiment, three seed lots of turnip rape hybrid (B. rapa x campestris), turnip (B. campestris) and forage rape (B. napus); and seven seed lots of Asian rape (B. napus), six seed lots of Asian kale (B. oleraceae var. alboglabra L.) and five seed lots of choisum (B. rapa var. pekinensis) with germinations above 90% were aged at two different temperatures (41 and 42&#176;C &#177; 0.3&#176;C) and three ageing times (24, 48 and 72 &#177; 15 minutes). The second experiment was divided into three sections. In the first, the same seed lots and species were aged at one temperature (41&#176;C) and time (72 h), but either 40 ml of saturated salts; KCl (83%RH), NaCl (76%RH), NaBr (55%RH); or distilled water (96%RH) were used as the ageing solutions. In the second, one turnip rape hyprid seed lot was aged at three temperatures (41, 42 and 45&#176;C) and two times (72 and 96h), again using the three saturated salts and distilled water as ageing solutions. In the third, three turnip rape hybrid seed lots and three Asian kale seed lots were surface sterilised (1 % sodium hypochlorite) prior to ageing at one temperature (41&#176;C) and time (72 h). In the third experiment, the same species and seed lots used in experiment one at their original seed moisture content (SMC) were tested for conductivity after soaking in deionised water for 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 h. They were then re-tested after the SMC had been adjusted to 8.5%. In the fourth experiment, three seed lots of forage rape and three seed lots of Asian kale were graded into three seed size categories; large (retained on a 2.0 mm screen), medium (retained on a 1.7 mm screen) and small (passed through a 1.7 mm screen). Graded seeds were then tested for standard germination, AA (41&#176;C/48 h) and conductivity (measured at 16 and 24 h). In the final experiment, the relationships between laboratory tests for the six species (each consisting of three seed lots), field emergence from three sowings, and cold room emergence were evaluated. Both time and temperature influenced post-AA germination. Increasing the ageing period from 48 to 72 hours at 41&#176;C, and 24 to 48 hours at 42&#176;C resulted in decreased mean germination percentage for all species but not always clear separation of seed lots. While there were sometimes few differences between ageing at 41&#176;C and 42&#176;C, the former is preferred because it is already the temperature used for other species. For Asian rape, choisum and turnip, the previously recommended testing conditions of 41&#176;C/72 h provided good seed lot separation, but for Asian kale and turnip rape hybrid, AA testing at 41&#176;C/48 h provided better results. Seed moisture content after ageing ranged from 29-37% depending on species. Fungal growth on seeds during the ageing period appeared to reduce post-ageing germination in some seed lots . Substituting saturated salts for distilled water did not stress seed lots in the AA test, due to the lowered RH%, the exception being seed lots 1210 and 1296. For forage and Asian species, seed lot germination mostly remained above 90% when aged for 72 h at lowered RH%. Increasing the ageing duration from 72 to 96 hours resulted in some decreases in post-AA germination but no clear separation of seed lots. Surface sterilising the seeds prior to the AA test resulted in a lower incidence of contaminant fungi which was associated with a lower percentage of abnormal seedlings. The conductivity test was mostly able to identify vigour differences among forage and Asian vegetable brassica seed lots. Differences in conductivity readings were observed among seed lots in all species. Increasing the period of imbibition resulted in increased conductivity from most seed lots but radicle emergence occurred after 16-20 h of imbibition. Variation was observed in the time to reach 95% maximum of the imbibition curve for most species. Conductivity readings at 16 h would avoid possible influences of radicle emergence on results. Adjusting the SMC to 8.5% resulted in reduced variation in conductivity among replicates of seed lots, due to a reduction in imbibition damage. Seed size had a significant effect on both post-AA germination and conductivity results. In forage rape, large size seeds had higher post-AA germination cf. medium cf. small size seeds. In Asian kale, large size seeds had higher post-AA germination compared with small size seeds. For both forage rape and Asian kale, large size seeds had lower conductivity readings cf. small size seeds. The correlation analyses demonstrated significant relationships between AA testing and field emergence parameters (percentage emergence, emergence index and emergence rate). Significant relationships were also observed between conductivity testing and these field emergence parameters. Based on the correlation analysis, AA testing at 41&#176;C/48 hand/or 42&#176;C/48 h could be recommended to be used as an AA test for turnip and Asian rape; and 41&#176;C/48 hand/or 41&#176;C/72 h for Asian kale and choisum. Based on the correlation analysis, conductivity testing at 16 h can be used to predict the field emergence potential of forage and Asian vegetable seed lots. Vigour tests were consistently able to provide better indicators of field perfonnance than the standard germination test, although these relationships did vary with the different field sowings.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brassica</field><field name="subject">seedling vigour</field><field name="subject">fungal contamination</field><field name="subject">germination</field><field name="subject">field emergence</field><field name="subject">accelerated ageing</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production::300203 Plant improvement (selection, breeding and genetic engineering)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1274</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wetland conservation in Canterbury, New Zealand : human-nature relationships and participation in local environmental groups</field><field name="creator">Sieber, Tara L.</field><field name="description">Wetlands are defined by New Zealand's Resource Management Act 1991 as "includ[ing] permanently or intermittently wet areas, shallow water and land water margins that support a natural ecosystem of plants and animals that are adapted to wet conditions" (RMA 1991). Over ninety per cent of New Zealand wetlands have been lost or modified. Several conservation groups composed of volunteers have formed to protect the few remaining areas. These wetlands and their conservators serve as an interesting study into human-nature relationships because of the precarious state of the ecosystems and the dedicated, local volunteer groups that form around them. I explored the relationship between the two through the 'soft systems tradition', which places importance on a human constructed "system of interest" (Oreszczyn 2000, p.109) in order to answer three research questions: How can the relationship between members of the wetland conservation groups and the wetlands they preserve be described; What 'triggers' people's participation and involvement in local environmental groups dedicated to wetland preservation and restoration; How do the groups advocate for wetlands and does the government play a role in this advocacy?  Using cultural models (Kempton et al. 1995), I argued that definitions and representations of nature are contested. Notions of place and dwelling, of actor-network theory (Cloke and Jones 2002), and of enclosure/restoration (Watts 2004, Elliot 1986), help to explain how people form their representations of nature within wetlands. Social capital theory (Putnam 2000) helped explain participants' involvement in wetland groups. Participants were involved in the wetland protection groups in order to express personal values, skills and identity through the group (Bishop and Hoggett 1986). Most individuals had a high sense of agency, and joined a wetland protection group because they believed that collective action is more effective than individual action (Taylor 2000, Horvath 1999). Groups that meet regularly and frequently, such as the Travis Wetland Trust, have more cohesive inter-personal bonds and individuals are more committed to the group than groups that meet infrequently (Lawler et al. 2000, Lawler 2001, 2002). This connection between group activities and positive emotion (Lawler 2002) explains why most members of the Travis Wetland Trust identified group involvement as the most important aspect of their involvement. In contrast, Otipua Wetland groups' members, who are divided between the Otipua Wetland Charitable Trust Board and the Friends of the Otipua Wetland, were more likely to name restoration or service as their primary reason for involvement in the group. Advocacy was considered part of group action, although it was not officially included in either group's objectives. Individuals believed they advocated in three ways: through education activities, communication regarding the wetland and through the restoration of the work itself. Individual advocacy translates into group advocacy, since the groups are viewed as vehicles for furthering individual concerns, and acting as a group gives a better chance of achieving results (Horvath 1999). The government played a role in both groups, and all parties maintained a positive working relationship with local government. A cooperative relationship with governments is essential for increasing public awareness of wetlands (Horvath 1999).</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nature</field><field name="subject">human-nature relationships</field><field name="subject">advocacy</field><field name="subject">local environmental groups</field><field name="subject">wetlands</field><field name="subject">Canterbury</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">enclosure</field><field name="subject">restoration</field><field name="subject">place and dwelling</field><field name="subject">productive exchange</field><field name="subject">160802 - Environmental Sociology</field><field name="subject">060204 - Freshwater Ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/2020</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Semiclassical Lp Estimates for Quasimodes on Submanifolds</field><field name="creator">Tacy, Melissa Evelyn</field><field name="description">Motivated by the desire to understand classical-quantum correspondences, we study  concentration phenomena   of approximate eigenfunctions of a semiclassical pseudodifferential operator $P(h)$.  Such eigenfunctions appear as steady state solutions of quantum  systems. Here we think of $h$  as being a small parameter such that $h^{2}$ is inversely proportional to the energy of such a system. As we understand classical mechanics to be the high energy (or small $h$) limit of quantum mechanics we expect the behaviour of eigenfunctions $u(h)$ for small $h$ to be related to properties of the associated classical system. In particular we study the connection between the classical flow and the quantum concentration properties. 

The  flow, $(x(t),\xi(t))$, of a classical system describes the system's motion through phase space where $x(t)$ is interpreted as position and $\xi(t)$ is interpreted as momentum. In the quantum regime we think of an eigenfunction as being composed of highly localised packets moving along bicharacteristics of the classical flow. With this intuition we relate concentration of eigenfunctions in a region to the time spent by projections of bicharacteristics there.

 We use the $L^{p}$ norm of $u$ when restricted to submanifolds as a measure of concentration. A high $L^{p}$ norm particularly for small $p$ is indicative of concentration near the submanifold. 


We reduce the estimates on eigenfunctions to operator norm estimates on associated evolution operators. Using the semiclassical analysis methods developed in Chapter 3 we express these evolution operators as oscillatory integral operators. Chapter 2 covers the technical background needed to work with such operators. In Chapter 4 we determine eigenfunction estimates for eigenfunctions restricted to a smooth embedded submanifold $Y$ of arbitrary dimension. If $Y$ is a hypersurface, the greatest concentration occurs when there are bicharacteristics of the classical flow embedded in $Y$. In Chapter 5 we assume that projections of such bicharacteristics can  be at worst simply tangent to $Y$ and thereby obtain better results for small values of $p$.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">eigenfunction estimate</field><field name="subject">restriction to submanifold</field><field name="subject">semiclassical analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20100622.150105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD.

As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Biography of Crawford Munro: A Vision for Australia's Water and A Survey of Twentieth Century Australian Science Biography</field><field name="creator">Professor Ross Humphreys</field><field name="description">1. The biography of Crawford Munro (1904-76) describes his early life in Toowoomba and Sydney, and his maturation as an engineer, working for Sydney Water, Sydney Technical College and in the production of Cruiser tanks in World War II. He was a large confident man with a big voice and an optimistic, humorous personality. As the Foundation Professor of Civil Engineering at the University of New South Wales Munro was liberal, fostered humanist studies and developed the School of Engineering with a unique emphasis on water engineering. He recruited excellent staff for research and postgraduate education who led the nation across all phases of hydrology and hydraulics. Munro developed a remarkable, rational solution for flood mitigation at Launceston, and actively promoted research, partly through the Australian Water Research Foundation and the Institution of Engineers, Australia. He was much involved with predicting flood runoff, developing benefit/cost relations for irrigation schemes, which led him into public controversy, and other hydrological projects. Munro&#8217;s attempts to raise social consciousness about water problems, his multi-disciplinary approach to the evaluation of water resources and his campaigns for the collection of stream and rainfall data helped provide a better basis for proper planning. In his later years he undertook the first Australian environmental impact study. The concluding chapter outlines a vision for the current management of Australia&#8217;s water. Munro posed necessary questions about measuring the supply of water and bringing the demand of water into synchrony with its supply, while providing water security in terms of its availability and quality. He raised the debate about the balance between sustaining environmental flows, utilizing water for agriculture and secondary industry, and maintaining the health of communities. Munro hoped equitable decision making would emerge from public engagement on these issues. 2. Twentieth century science biography in Australia is the province of a group of elite male scientists, whose interests cover wide disciplinary fields; it is focused on popular imagination: health, food and adventure (Antarctica) accounting for fifteen of the seventeen scientists. Empathy for the subject is a significant feature of the nineteen biographers, of whom five are scientists. This small genre is often supported by institutions in small print runs. A key role of biography is to place through science history a more epistemologically plausible version of events. Public discourses of science treated in the essay include conflict about the attribution of scientific discovery, the vocation of the scientist as a contributor to a wider social polity, the light biography sheds on sources of creativity and the evolution of the research and culture of institutions. The biographer attempts to generate a personal portrait of the scientist which conveys authority about the significance and origins of his or her scientific discoveries and their impact in the wider social context. Thomas S&#246;derqvist&#8217;s affirmation of the existential approach which &#8216;emphasizes the freedom and responsibility of the human individual&#8217; resonates with the candidate as expressing characteristics of the lives of many Australian scientists in their passion for intellectual discovery, their motivation to self-empowerment, and their readiness to step outside their social conditioning. This essay extends S&#246;derqvist&#8217;s paradigm to the context of Australian science biography and indicates some constraints on its depiction which arise in the practice of writing science biography. Some epistemological issues are raised in the texts, especially when dealing with oral history and family mythology, and thematic, thematic within a chronological framework or chronological structures of the text are compared. The level of detail and context influence the sustainability of the reader&#8217;s interest. Case studies of the biographies written by the candidate (Ian Clunies Ross, Samuel Wadham, Allan Callaghan, Victor Trikojus, Raymond Hoffenberg and Crawford Munro) illustrate issues which arise in the writing of science biography. The dominant question is the relationship of the biographer to the subject, and this determines the voice the reader hears. The motivation of the biographer may arise in varying degrees of empathy felt for the subject. The high affinity the candidate had for Clunies Ross and Hoffenberg causes him to offer a defence against the charge of hagiography, and the selectivity and subjectivity of the biographer is evident in the arrangement and presentation of factual material. The motivation of the biographer is additionally directed to the communication of the subject&#8217;s research outputs to the wider Australian community, and in the case of Callaghan, Wadham and Clunies Ross there was a specific programmatic function of advancing the status of agricultural science. It is argued that the description of the public life of the subject needs to be complemented from the private life if the biographer is &#8216;to view the world through the eyes of the subject&#8217;.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">science biography, epistemology, history, science institutions, munro, water, hydrology, environmental sustainability, irrigation, planning</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:195937</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical Simulation of a Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Reservoir in the Cooper Basin, South Australia</field><field name="creator">Bronwyn Muller</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the development and production of numerical simulations of the creation of a Hot Dry Rock (HDR) geothermal reservoir. This geothermal reservoir that was simulated is owned by Geodynamics Limited and is located in the Cooper Basin, South Australia. The simulations show the geometry of the geothermal reservoir and predict the productive lifespan of the reservoir. Geothermal energy, which is the thermal energy that is stored in the interior of the earth, is an enormous energy source and as such there is great interest in technology that allows this energy to be harnessed. The HDR process of extracting the geothermal energy from rock involves drilling a borehole to a suitable depth and injecting cold water into the rock via this well (known as the injection well) to create a reservoir by opening up fractures in the rock. As water is forced through the reservoir, heat is extracted from the rock via conduction and transferred to the water, creating an heat exchange. Warm water is brought to the surface via another well known as the extraction well. The heat from the water is used to generate electricity and then the water is fed back into the injection well, completing the cycle. The creation of a HDR geothermal reservoir comprises of many aspects: the injection of the fluid into the jointed rock system, the opening and shearing of the joints, the creation of the fluid reservoir in the rock and the temperature effects of the fluid flow through the joints. This work incorporates all of these aspects. Due to the multi-physics nature of this process multiple computational modelling strategies were implemented to allow for authentic simulation of the entire process. The mechanical rock behaviour was primarily simulated the Distinct Element Method. This two dimensional Distinct Element Method program allowed for a realistically scaled model of the whole geothermal reservoir to be developed. This model was particularly useful for modelling the joint behaviour as the discrete nature of this method compares well with the joint system on such a scale. A discrete particle based model was used to model the joint behaviour on a small scale. These models demonstrated the behaviour of joints under compressional strain, showing slip and the effects of joint dilatancy. The productive lifespan of the geothermal reservoir was modelled using a Finite Element Method program based on Darcy's Law and an height-averaged heat equation. The aim of this model was to simulate the effects on the rock temperature of the fluid flow through the reservoir. The lifespan of the reservoir with differing well geometries was tested using this model to show which geometry would extend the productive lifetime of the geothermal reservoir. The results produced from the DEM models showed that the reservoir geometry is very much dependent upon the joint angle, and under the Cooper Basin stress regime steeper joints will be more likely to open. Joint dilatancy also affects the fluid flow rates as the amount of joint opening is dependent upon the joint dilatancy angle. The modelling of the temperature drawdown of the rock due to the fluid flow showed that a square configuration of wells is the ideal configuration to prolong the productive lifespan of the HDR geothermal reservoir. Results produced with the modelling parameters provided by Geodynamics Limited indicate that the productive lifespan of the Cooper Basin HDR geothermal reservoir created is approximately 50 years. This reservoir is only one of many that can be created at the site to prolong the productivity of the energy plant. The combined results of this modelling strategy give an overall image of the creation and lifetime of the HDR geothermal energy plant in the Cooper Basin.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260000 Earth Sciences</field><field name="subject">HDR</field><field name="subject">geothermal</field><field name="subject">Cooper Basin</field><field name="subject">Geodynamics</field><field name="subject">finite element</field><field name="subject">distinct element</field><field name="subject">Escript</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206571</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Associations of patterns of daily life, physical fitness and body composition of primary school age children</field><field name="creator">Kira, Geoffrey Dean Juranovich</field><field name="description">The daily patterns of life, for example, food, physical activity and inactivity and sleep as well as physical fitness are associated with the accumulation of excess body fat in children. A positive energy balance between food (energy intake) and metabolism, particularly physical activity (energy output) is the accepted explanation. The reality of daily life for children is excessive calorie consumption, imbalances in macronutrient intake and missed opportunities for activity are being driven by the physical and social environment. Excess body fat tracks into adulthood and is associated with decreased insulin sensitivity, which may lead to increased risk of insulin resistance and chronic disease. Resting metabolic rate and substrate utilisation (measured by respiratory exchange ratio) are implicated in the prediction of weight gain in adults, but these relationships have been rarely explored in children. Both insulin and respiratory exchange provide insights into the pathways of accumulation of body fat. The purpose of this body of work presented here was to explore and explain how lifestyle patterns, substrate metabolism, physical fitness attributes and insulin resistance are related to excess body fat accumulation in children. &#8220;Project Energize&#8221; is a Waikato District Health Board-initiated through-school nutrition and physical activity intervention, operated in a growing number of primary schools throughout the Waikato. Data was collected from Project Energize control and programme schools between 2004 and 2006. The children that participated in this body of work were aged between 5 and 12 years of age (20% M&#257;ori). Fat mass (FM) change in Hamilton and Waikato primary school age children over a two year period is reported in study one (n=618). Study two (n=69) and three (n=169) are cross-sectional sub-studies of low decile schools (&lt;3) that employ two methods of metabolic assessment; indirect calorimetry and glucose homeostasis; to investigate the relationships between food, activity, fitness with body composition and metabolic risk. More than 70% of the increase in body mass index (BMI) and percentage body fat (PBF) could be explained by the same measures two years earlier and more than 10% of the reported food, activity and sleep behaviours were able to be predicted from the responses two years earlier. There were no clear associations found with resting respiratory exchange ratio (RER), but resting metabolic rate (RMR) was best explained (45%) by fat free mass with a further 3% explained by cardiorespiratory fitness. Children with longer legs (as represented by height) travelled further, but FM attenuated final speed. Children with more fat had higher insulin resistance. Physical fitness was not associated with insulin resistance. Overall, a pattern of increased FM was linked to: 1. FM two years previously 2. a lesser speed attained in the 20m Shuttle Run Test and 3. higher insulin resistance. A focus on weight gain rather than change in FM and FFM, fitness and metabolic markers as the outcome of interventions is unlikely to show short or medium term changes. Therefore it is recommended that when instigating school-based nutrition and physical activity programmes, there must also be a focus on the daily patterns of life alongside community, family and culture-based partnerships to support sustainable behavioural change.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en_NZ</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">nutrition</field><field name="subject">physical activity</field><field name="subject">body composition</field><field name="subject">physical fitness</field><field name="subject">insulin sensitivity</field><field name="subject">primary school</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/930</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The value of direct and indirect written corrective feedback for intermediate ESL students</field><field name="creator">Lu, Yang</field><field name="description">This study looks at the effectiveness of direct and indirect written corrective feedback (WCF) when using them with 26 intermediate ESL learners&#8217; writings. The study also investigates whether giving the learners the type of feedback they preferred or less preferred would influence their actual performance. WCF, a pedagogy that is often used when helping learners improve their written accuracy, has captured researchers&#8217; attention in recent decades. Truscott (1996) claimed that WCF is ineffective and suggested teachers should abandon it. Therefore, in the early studies, researchers concentrated on examining the effectiveness of WCF, in order to justify the value of using WCF. In recent studies, researchers have proved that WCF is effective in certain contexts, and they have also investigated the value of using different types of WCF, and the value of using it over time. Moreover, in order to help learners to improve in written accuracy, recent studies in the field have also investigated whether WCF is more effective when used on a certain type of linguistic form/structure. With respect to different types of WCF, researchers in recent decades have also paid some attention to learner preference in WCF. However, the relationship between learner preference and the value of using the type of feedback learners prefer has not yet been investigated. In essence, the relationship between learner preference and their actual performance when using the type of feedback they preferred was examined in this study. The study also aimed to look at the effectiveness of WCF over time, and to investigate whether direct feedback or indirect feedback helped learners better. Furthermore, the study also aimed to investigate whether there was a certain type of linguistic form that WCF works best with. A quantitative approach was used in this study in order to show the results more clearly, and to provide statistical evidence on each finding. The study involved questionnaires, and three writing tests: pre-test, immediate post-test, and a delayed post-test. Before the learners did the pre-test, they were asked to complete a questionnaire to select their preferred type of feedback (direct feedback or indirect feedback). Based on their preferences on feedback, they were put into different groups. Group one received direct feedback; group two received indirect feedback; group three received the feedback they preferred (indirect feedback); group four received no linguistic feedback, but general commentaries on their writing were given. The participants (twenty-six students who enrolled in a general English program at AUT University) had completed the questionnaire and the three writing tests. Findings from the study revealed that, most of the learners preferred receiving direct feedback. When examining learner performance between those who received the type of feedback they preferred and those who did not, the former did not outperform than others. However, factors like different levels of scaffolding assistance may have affected the results. Other findings from the study revealed that WCF was effective overtime, especially when using it on errors of present simple tense. The study also found that indirect feedback was more effective than direct feedback. A possible factor that appeared to influence learners&#8217; performance was identified as learners&#8217; motivation in learning. The results of the study contribute to an understanding of the type of feedback that is most suitable for learners at intermediate level, and on which type of linguistic form WCF can work best with. Practical suggestions for pedagogy and further research are also made.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">written corrective feedback</field><field name="subject">direct and indirect WCF</field><field name="subject">linguistics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/929</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using emergent technologies to develop sustainable architectural composites</field><field name="creator">Palmer, Fleur</field><field name="description">The intention of this project is to research the potential of emergent technologies for developing sustainable composites for the building industry.

Strippers manipulate mens desires and fantasies and parody, through their routine, the male in the act of sex.

The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polymerisation and export of alginate in Pseudomanas aeruginosa : functional assignment and catalytic mechanism of Alg8/44 : a thesis presented to Massey University in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Microbiology</field><field name="creator">Remminghorst, Uwe</field><field name="description">Alginate biosynthesis is not only a major contributor to pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa but also an important factor in colonization of adverse environmental habitats by biofilm formation. The requirement of proteins Alg8 and Alg44, encoded by their respective genes in the alginate biosynthesis gene cluster, for alginate biosynthesis of P. aeruginosa was demonstrated, since deletion mutants were unable to produce or polymerise alginate. AlgX deletion mutants failed to produce the alginate characteristic mucoid phenotype, but showed low concentrations of uronic acid monomers in the culture supernatants. Complementation experiments using PCR based approaches were used to determine the complementing ORF and all deletion mutants could be complemented to at least wildtype levels by introducing a plasmid harbouring the respective gene. Increased copy numbers of Alg44 did not impact on the amount of alginate produced, whereas increased copy numbers of the alg8 gene led to an at least 10 fold stronger alginate production impacting on biofilm structure and stability. Topological analysis using reporter protein fusions and subsequent subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that Alg8 is located in the cytoplasmic membrane and contains at least 4 transmembrane helices, 3 of them at its C terminus. Its large cytosolic loop showed similarities to inverting glycosyltransferases and the similarities were used to generate a threading model using SpsA, a glycosyltransferase involved in spore coat formation of B. subtilis, as a template. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the importance of identified motifs commonly detected in glycosyltransferases. Inactivation of the DXD motif, which has been shown to be involved in nucleotide sugar binding, led to loss-offunction mutants of Alg8 and further replacements revealed putative candidates for the catalytic residue(s). Contradicting the commonly reported prediction of being a transmembrane protein, Alg44 was shown to be a periplasmic protein. The highest specific alkaline phosphatase activity of its fusion protein could be detected in the periplasmic fraction and not in the insoluble membrane fraction. Bioinformatical analysis of Alg44 revealed structural similarities of its N terminus to PilZ domains, shown to bind cyclic-di-GMP, and of its C terminus to MexA, a membrane fusion protein involved in multi-drug efflux systems. Thus, it was suggested that Alg44 has a regulatory role for alginate biosynthesis in bridging the periplasm and connecting outer and cytoplasmic membrane components. AlgX was shown to interact with MucD, a periplasmic serine protease or chaperone homologue, and is suggested to exert its impact on alginate production via MucD interaction. In vitro alginate polymerisation assays revealed that alginate production requires protein components of the outer and cytoplasmic membrane as well as the periplasm, and these data were used to construct a model describing a multi-enzyme, membrane and periplasm spanning complex for alginate polymerisation, modification and export.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pseudomonas aeruginosa</field><field name="subject">alginates</field><field name="subject">biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of milk protein ingredients on physico-chemical properties of rice starch : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology at Massey University Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Noisuwan, Angkana</field><field name="description">The overall aim of this thesis is to determine if the interactions between normal and waxy rice starch and milk proteins from four milk protein ingredients, namely skim milk powder (SMP), milk protein concentrate (MPC), sodium caseinate (NaCAS) and whey protein isolate (WPI) do occur, and to identify the mechanisms underlying these interactions. Different milk protein ingredients at various concentrations (0 to 10%, w/w) affected markedly and differently the pasting behaviour of 10% (w/w) rice starches. SMP delayed the pasting of both rice starches by increasing the onset temperature (Tonset) and the peak viscosity temperature (Tpeak) of pasting. This was mainly due to the presence of lactose and ions, which was further supported by the investigation of the effects of UFSMP (a solution of salts and lactose present in SMP at their proper concentration) and lactose. The addition of NaCAS also delayed the pasting of rice starch; Tpeak in the case of both starches was increased. For normal rice starch paste, MPC and WPI decreased the Tpeak. MPC had no affect on Tpeak of waxy rice starch paste. The qualitative viscoelastic behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient gels obtained from the above pastes was dominated by the continuous phase made of the starch molecules. There was evidence, as indicated by confocal microscopy, of phase separation between the milk proteins of SMP and MPC and the two starches. The phase separation was not observed in the addition of either NaCAS or WPI. Studies on the thermal behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient mixtures by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that SMP, similarly to UFSMP, delayed the gelatinization of both starches. NaCAS also delayed the gelatinisation of both starches but had a greater effect on waxy than normal rice starch. The addition of NaCAS did not affect Tonset but increased Tpeak for normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinisation temperature of waxy rice starch was highly affected by the addition of NaCAS with both Tonset and Tpeak shifted to higher temperatures. MPC had no affect on the gelatinization temperature of normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinization temperature of waxy rice starch was increased by the addition of MPC. The addition of WPI to both rice starches showed two thermal transitions. The first of these was due to the gelatinisation of the starches and the second to the denaturation of &#223;-lactoglobulin (&#223;-lg). The addition of WPI to normal rice starch showed that the thermal behaviour of normal starch and protein were independent from each other. In contrast, the thermal behaviour of waxy rice starch was modified by the addition of WPI; both Tonset and Tpeak were increased. SMP decreased the Tonset of swelling, swelling ratio and the amount of starch leaching from both starches. These observed changes were due to the presence of lactose and ions in SMP. NaCAS slightly increased Tonset of swelling but the amount of starch leaching was reduced for both rice starches. The rigidity of both starches tended to increase in the presence of NaCAS. MPC and WPI affected the swelling behaviour of normal and waxy rice starch differently. A dramatic increase in the swelling of normal rice starch/MPC or WPI mixtures was observed, whereas this trend was not evident for waxy rice starch/ MPC or WPI mixtures. The difference in the water holding ability and gelatinization peak temperatures of the two starches over the temperature range at which whey proteins denature and form gels are believed to be responsible for the observed differences. The results from confocal microscopy showed that milk proteins, such as a-casein, &#223;- casein, &#223;-lg and a-lactalbumin (a-la), were adsorbed onto the granule surface of both normal and waxy rice starch. The mechanism for this adsorption is the hydrophilic interactions; hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl group from terminated glucan molecule that protrude around starch granule surface-hydroxyl; amino, or other electron-donation or electron-accepting groups of the added proteins. Using sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) it was found that for SMP and MPC the adsorbed as- to &#223;-casein ratio on both starches was similar to the as-casein to &#223;- casein ratio in the casein micelle at low SMP and MPC concentrations. But at high concentrations of SMP or MPC, this ratio decreased indicating that more &#223;-casein was adsorbed preferentially to as-casein. In the case of NaCAS, as-casein was adsorbed preferentially to &#223;-casein. Moreover, there was evidence of multilayer adsorption of ascasein into the surface of rice starch granules. Compared to the other milk protein ingredients, very small amounts of the &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI were adsorbed onto starch granules. However, the adsorbed amounts of &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI continuously increased with increasing WPI concentration, suggesting that these two proteins, particularly &#223;-lg, adsorbed in multilayers too.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">waxy rice starch</field><field name="subject">lactoglobulin</field><field name="subject">gelatinazation</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290104 Other food sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anthelmintic treatment and digestive organ morphology of captive-reared kaki (Himantopus novaezelandiae) released to the wild : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Robertson, Louise Mary</field><field name="description">The continued existence of New Zealand&#8217;s critically endangered and endemic black stilt or kak&#239; (Himantopus novaezelandiae) relies on an intensive captive management programme. While this is successful at rearing large numbers of birds for release to the wild, poor survivability of these birds is limiting significant increases in the wild population. Predation and starvation are suspected to be the most common causes of death in released birds, but underlying contributing factors to these mortalities have not been fully evaluated. This research investigates the possible contribution of gastrointestinal (GI) helminth burdens and suboptimal digestive organ development to the high mortality rates of released kak&#239;. Emphasis is placed on evaluating the methods used to assess the importance of these factors and to make informed recommendations for future management. The efficacy of the anthelmintic regime used for kak&#239; was assessed by dosing half of the 80 captive birds with praziquantel (PZQ) prior to release in 2007. Faecal samples were collected before and after anthelmintic treatment, and before and after release to the wild. Post mortem worm counts were conducted on 11 birds that died following release and historical worm count records dating back to 1997 were accessed. The main findings were: PZQ had high efficacy against trematodes; treatment did not prevent re-infection; birds were exposed to helminths at release site; and there was no advantage of treatment for survival. Overall, the results suggest that anthelmintic treatment is an unnecessary cost. Consequently, recommendations were made to cease anthelmintic treatment or reduce its intensity, continue health screening, and incorporate annual efficacy testing to monitor the emergence of anthelmintic resistance. The reliability of faecal screening for GI helminths was evaluated. Faecal egg counts (FECs) were found to be poor indicators of worm burden. The two modified sedimentation methods used to detect trematodes provided relatively low egg recovery rates. Trematode egg shedding varied between days but not by hour of the day or temperature. The collection and analysis of pooled faecal samples proved to be more cost and time-effective than samples from individual birds and the larger masses collected resulted in greater sensitivity. In conclusion, faecal analysis of pooled samples is a useful qualitative indicator of helminth presence or absence but is quantitatively unreliable. In order to assess the importance of digestive organ development to captive-reared and released kak?, the digestive organs of healthy and emaciated captive, released and wild Himantopus sp. were compared. Captive and released kak? had generally smaller digestive organs than wild birds, released birds did not increase digestive organ size to match the high fibre wild diet, and emaciated birds did not have atrophied organs. However, the greatest mortality rates occur soon after release, while the birds were still being supplementary fed. These results suggest that reduced digestive efficiency is probably not contributing significantly to mortality rates and the direct impacts of the translocation are probably greater risk factors. The continued provision of supplementary food to released birds and an increased focus on habitat enhancement and predator control at release sites were recommended. The reliability of comparing fresh and formalin fixed Himantopus sp. gut specimens was evaluated. Significant differences in fresh and formalin fixed organ dry masses and variation in preserved organ lengths indicate that this variation should be considered in future studies. In conclusion, current management practices appear to be successful in ensuring that GI helminths and reduced digestive efficiency do not significantly lower the survivorship of captive-reared and released kak&#239;. There is a need for further research into developing a more direct physiological assessment of the impacts of GI helminths and gut morphology as well as considering the role that starvation may have on poor survivability.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">black stilt</field><field name="subject">captive management</field><field name="subject">endangered species</field><field name="subject">gastrointestinal helminth</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300805 Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accelerating classifier training using AdaBoost within cascades of boosted ensembles : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Sciences at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Susnjak, Teo</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to address current problems encountered when training classifiers within the framework of cascades of boosted ensembles (CoBE). At present, a signifi- cant challenge facing this framework are inordinate classifier training runtimes. In some cases, it can take days or weeks (Viola and Jones, 2004; Verschae et al., 2008) to train a classifier. The protracted training runtimes are an obstacle to the wider use of this framework (Brubaker et al., 2006). They also hinder the process of producing effective object detection applications and make the testing of new theories and algorithms, as well as verifications of others research, a considerable challenge (McCane and Novins, 2003). An additional shortcoming of the CoBE framework is its limited ability to train clas- sifiers incrementally. Presently, the most reliable method of integrating new dataset in- formation into an existing classifier, is to re-train a classifier from beginning using the combined new and old datasets. This process is inefficient. It lacks scalability and dis- cards valuable information learned in previous training. To deal with these challenges, this thesis extends on the research by Barczak et al. (2008), and presents alternative CoBE frameworks for training classifiers. The alterna- tive frameworks reduce training runtimes by an order of magnitude over common CoBE frameworks and introduce additional tractability to the process. They achieve this, while preserving the generalization ability of their classifiers. This research also introduces a new framework for incrementally training CoBE clas- sifiers and shows how this can be done without re-training classifiers from beginning. However, the incremental framework for CoBEs has some limitations. Although it is able to improve the positive detection rates of existing classifiers, currently it is unable to lower their false detection rates.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CoBE framework</field><field name="subject">classifiers</field><field name="subject">classification algorithms</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280212 Neural networks, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The physiological effects of pseudoephedrine on endurance cycling : a thesis submitted in the partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Sport and Exercise Science, Massey University (Palmerston North, New Zealand)</field><field name="creator">Mouatt, Joshua Roger</field><field name="description">Background: Pseudoephedrine (PSE) is a mild central nervous system stimulant that when consumed at a high dosage has the potential to alter physiological and psychophysical responses. PSE is widely accessible as over-the-counter medication and despite limited research into PSE at high dosages or its effects on prolonged exercise (&gt;2 hours) is no-longer on the World Anti-Doping Association&#8217;s banned substance list. Currently unrestricted in sport and with no real understanding of the abovementioned responses during endurance exercise there is a high potential for abuse in sport. A recent study performed in our laboratory found PSE to improve self-paced cycling performance in some individuals, however no physiological measurements were taken Purpose: The primary purpose of this study was to determine the physiological effects of PSE at a dosage previously shown to improve performance (2.5 mg/kg) in some individuals during prolonged cycling. A secondary purpose of this study was to assess the effect on endurance cycling performance. Methods: In a randomized, double-blind and counter-balanced design, ten welltrained cyclists participated in two trials, consisting of 120 min of fixed-intensity cycling at 65% VO2max followed by a set work, self-paced time-trial (TT) of ~30 min, following ingestion of either 2.5 mg/kg PSE or visual-matched glucose placebo. Venous blood samples were collected before and during exercise, along with body temperatures and heart rate. Perceived effort and expired gas samples were collected during exercise. Exercise and diet was controlled ~48-hours prior to the trials. Results: Mean heart rate was significantly higher with PSE (P = 0.028) during fixed-intensity exercise. Blood glucose concentrations were significantly lower with PSE (P &lt;0.001) for the first 40 min of fixed-intensity exercise. Respiratory exchange ratio was lower in the final 20-min of fixed-intensity and TT with PSE. Blood lactate, perceived effort, ventilation, and body temperatures were not significantly different between conditions during exercise, nor was TT performance; however individual response was variable. Conclusions: PSE ingestion increased heart rate during endurance cycling and initially suppressed carbohydrate release into the bloodstream while increasing fat oxidation in the later stages of exercise. Despite individual responses, endurance cycling performance remained unchanged with PSE ingestion.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cycling performance</field><field name="subject">physiological measurements</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321400 Human Movement and Sports Science::321401 Exercise physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1013</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Youth development, Maui styles : Kia tipu te rito o te pa harakeke, Tikanga and ahuatanga as a basis for a positive Maori youth development approach : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Maori Studies at Te Kunenga ki Purehuroa Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ware, Felicity Jane Rachel</field><field name="description">The Youth Development Strategy Aotearoa has been seen as an innovative approach to youth development. The E tipu e rea &#8211; Rangatahi Development Package was particularly useful for organisations implementing the strategy with Maori youth. There have been successful Maori youth development initiatives, though these have been ad hoc. Nonetheless, the realities and experiences of Maori youth are still not being fully addressed in national policy. This has implications for the support and resourcing of Maori youth development initiatives. Maori youth are members of a range of groups including whanau, hapu, iwi and Maori communities in te ao Maori as well as the wider youth population and New Zealand society. The histories, experiences and viewpoints of each distinct group contribute to diversity in the Maori youth population which presents challenges for Maori youth development. Maori development goals do not adequately focus on Maori youth and youth development theory does not fully consider culture. The challenge is to successfully integrate Maori culture and youth culture in a relevant and meaningful manner so that Maori youth can positively contribute to Maori development and wider New Zealand society. This study examines purakau (narratives) about Maui (Polynesian ancestor) as a template for the analysis of Maori youth development. Interviews were undertaken with a group of Maori youth from the Manawatu region. The research showed tikanga and ahuatanga were relevant to the contemporary daily lives of the participants. The study found that positive development and the realisation of potential for Maori youth was affected by individual and environmental influences. This thesis concludes by making recommendations for policy, practice and further research. Finally, it offers a culturally appropriate theoretical approach for positive Maori youth development.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori youth</field><field name="subject">purakau</field><field name="subject">narratives</field><field name="subject">youth policy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology::370102 Social policy and planning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1152</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality assessment and ethnicity : a New Zealand study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand.

To date there has only been two published studies that have used New Zealand relevant ethnic groups when analysing whether personality measures used in pre-employment settings exhibit different mean scores. The present thesis performed a systematic evaluation on the impact of ethnicity on personality traits. The study examined the impact of ethnicity on NZ Army Officer applicant personality assessment scores measured by the EPQ-R and GPP-I. Four ethnic groups (NZ Europeans, M&#226;ori, Pasifika, and Asian) were analysed for mean trait score differences among ethnic groups, the stability of these differences across different personality inventories and models, the variance of personality traits, the impact of ethnicity on age and gender relationships with personality traits, and how these differences were related to employment selection outcomes. The analyses revealed that ethnicity did have some impact on mean personality assessment scores used in the study. However, these were mostly small differences among ethnic groups. In addition, most of these differences found on the EPQ-R and the GPP-I were not consistent across inventories and models. There were no significant variance differences found on personality traits among ethnic groups. While initial analysis suggested that ethnicity did not influence the relationship between age and gender on personality assessment, further examination suggested that the relationship between gender and personality was impacted on by ethnicity. There were reassuring results found for New Zealand psychologists and HR specialists, as only two of the twelve traits analysed showed moderate differences on traits that were related to selection outcomes. However, for the NZ Army OSB selection process the findings in the present study indicate that the Lie scale on the EPQ-R and the Vigor trait on the GPP-I may need to be interpreted with caution for Asian and Pasifika groups. These results are discussed in terms of implications for personality theory, measurement, and the direction of future research.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personality assessment</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised</field><field name="subject">EPQ-R</field><field name="subject">Gordon Personal Profile - Inventory</field><field name="subject">GPP-I</field><field name="subject">ethnic status</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1188</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies in anaerobic/aerobic treatment of dairy shed effluent : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Agricultural Engineering at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Warburton, David John</field><field name="description">Increases in herd size and enforcement of water quality regulations have created an effluent disposal problem for the New Zealand dairy industry. Spray disposal to land and lagooning are commonly used but mechanical failures, management requirements and pressure on land have limited their suitability in many situations. This project was established to consider an alternative system. Initial studies revealed that anaerobic treatment in unmixed, non-insulated tanks, followed by trickling filter aeration, might be suitable. Two laboratory scale and one field treatment plant (1/15 - 1/20 full scale) were constructed to investigate the system. A factorial experimental design allowed investigation into three anaerobic treatment levels with a 3 x 3 aerobic treatment interaction nested within each anaerobic treatment. Anaerobic residence times of 5, 7.5 and 10 days provided loading rates of 1.35 - 0.63 kg COD/m3-day and 1.36 - 0.67 kg T S/m3-day. Removals between inlet and outlet averaged 71% and were insensitive to loading rate. Total solids accumulation rates of 40-50% TS input rate suggests that anaerobic tank design should be based on solids accumulation rate and cleaning frequency. The stone media trickling filter was loaded at approximately 0.61 kg COD/m3-day. Aeration periods of 1, 2 and 3 days and hydraulic loads of 2.8, 10.1 and 18.2 m3/m2-day were studied to determine their influence on treatment efficiency. Multiple regression analysis indicated that the longer residence times and higher recycle rates improved treatment efficiency. Removals varied with the measured parameters but ranged from 42-66% for COD. Design alterations to allow the final discharge to be taken from the bottom of the filter, after settling, would increase aerobic treatment efficiency above 75% COD removal. Prediction of treatment efficiencies beyond the monitored operating conditions suggested that only marginal improvements could be made. The TS accumulation rate in the aerobic phase was approximately 13% of the TS input rate or 56% of the BOD removal rate. Overall plant treatment efficiencies of 80-89% were obtained. Removals in excess of 92% could be achieved with minor design alterations. Maintenance and operational requirements were minimal. The only problem with the system was an average 15 fold increase in NO3-N and 4 fold increase in DIP under conditions for optimum removal of the other parameters. Intermittent land disposal could reduce this problem. Treatment comparison between similar laboratory plants, and between laboratory and field plants which varied by a scale factor of 56, suggests that identically designed plants would give a similar performance and that there is little scale effect. Increasing the scale only improved treatment efficiencies under unstable aerobic conditions, i.e., high recycle rates and low residence times. Increasing scale gave some decrease in maintenance and operational problems. Design of a full scale plant, based on daily pollution loads from a 250 cow dairy shed, suggests that the system is a viable proposition.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Milking parlors</field><field name="subject">Waste disposal</field><field name="subject">Dairy shed effluent</field><field name="subject">Anaerobic treatment</field><field name="subject">Agricultural Engineering</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::299900 Other Engineering and Technology::299901 Agricultural engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1400</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sell-side analysts' use and communication of intellectual capital information</field><field name="creator">Abhayawansa, Subhash Asanga</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intellectual capital</field><field name="subject">Sell-side analysts</field><field name="subject">Non-financial information</field><field name="subject">analyst reports</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/6260</field></doc><doc><field name="title">It's like having to trade on the personal : changing work, changing identities of public health learning and development practitioners.</field><field name="creator">Wilkins, Rob</field><field name="description">As a practitioner involved in the planning and development of educational activities in the field of public health, I have worked within many pedagogical traditions and program parameters. Through this work, I have experienced both subtle and radical shifts in the range of skills, knowledge and relationships required to collaboratively plan and evaluate educational work. In this professional and community-based landscape, competing and often overlapping models of education and evaluation have led to much conceptual confusion and ambiguity around narrowly defined notions of best practice, evidence and knowledge legitimacy. Drawing from Dorothy Smith&#8217;s (1999) standpoint theory from which my inquiry was developed as a result of my participation with colleagues in the field, I explore how three professional practice networks of learning and development practitioners speak of the skills, knowledge, relationships and worker identities in a changing field. This research seeks to explicate the kinds of informal and largely unarticulated knowledge that is produced through the changing contexts of work. This research maps the changing conditions of educational work through my own case stories of educational practice and uses these as a springboard for discussion among three diverse professional practice networks. The Story/Dialogue Method (S/D-M) developed by Labonte and Feather (1996), is a constructivist methodological approach that, in this application, structures group dialogue into reflective insights and theories about how educational work occurs in varied settings among different professional and community-based groups. A strong reliance on interpersonal skills was articulated by all three networks to build trust, assess individual and organisational learning needs, to build partnerships and to motivate learners. Skills were often described vaguely and summarised as a series of situational specific attributes. A valuing of reflexive, working knowledge as opposed to professional or discipline-based expertise was raised as an important aspect of partnership building and in negotiating program parameters. The need to build individual and organisational relationships through formal and informal encounters was cited as a series of legitimate yet often &#8216;behind the scenes&#8217; professional practices. Aligning with the notion of worker identity described by Chappell, Rhodes, Solomon, Tennant and Yates (2003) as process, practitioners spoke of their identities as constructed and temporary, negotiated through newly emerging roles and changing relationships with peers and learners. This study suggests that evidence-based practice is a contested term drawing its meanings from multiple theoretical and pedagogical traditions including that of intuition. Perhaps unsurprisingly then, evidence guiding educational approaches is viewed as a pragmatic and eclectic mix of tools stored to be adapted for use in new ways. Additionally, this study concludes that all participants (including myself) regard educational practice as a collaborative and continually negotiated endeavour.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">health practitioners</field><field name="subject">health promotion</field><field name="subject">public health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/368</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Habitat requirements and habitat use of the red-crowned toadlet Pseudophryne Australis and the giant burrowing frog Heleioporus Australiacus in the Sydney basin.</field><field name="creator">Stauber, Andrew G.</field><field name="description">Habitat requirements and habitat use for Pseudophryne australis and Heleioporus australiacus were investigated to aid management of these threatened frogs around Sydney, Australia. Much of the work focussed on roads, commonly encountered features in the habitat of both species. The habitat requirements based on locality records of both frogs in the Sydney Basin were investigated at four spatial scales. Both species are habitat specialists. They showed a strong geological association with Hawkesbury Sandstone and occupy upper topographic areas with ephemeral watercourses of gentle gradients. Both frogs occur predominantly in areas of higher precipitation and milder temperature regimes compared to averages representative of the region. Leaf litter is an important feature of P. australis breeding sites, whereas H australiacus generally associate with crayfish burrows. Both species are dependent on natural vegetation with a complex structure. H australiacus have a relatively long larval period (3 - 12 months) and breed in ephemeral pools, exposing their tadpoles to the risk of dying due to early pond drying. In the laboratory, tadpoles responded to decreasing water levels by shortening their larval periods and metamorphosing earlier than siblings held at constant water level. Despite this plastic response, a number of pools in the field failed to produce metamorphs due to early drying, an observation also made on P. australis. Regular monitoring of breeding sites revealed increased reproductive success away from roads for both species probably because of relatively longer hydroperiods. Spatial distributions and associations with habitat features, and movement patterns of both frogs were further investigated using mark-recapture methods. Both species showed strong site fidelity. P. australis formed small aggregations and predominantly selected leaf litter piles despite their relatively low availability. Leaf litter piles in creeks moved over time and the animals moved with these piles. In contrast, H australiacus individuals formed no aggregations and showed no preference for any available structural vegetation type. Locations of individuals were independent of relative distances to creeks and artificial drains, but males appeared to be more common near culverts. However, individuals were randomly distributed in space and nearest-neighbour distances were high relative to individual movement distances, suggesting minimal overlap between relatively large home ranges. Radio-telemetry demonstrated that some H australiacus individuals burrow in the road environment. There they would be at risk of being dug up and possibly injured during road works. The results are discussed in relation to the spatial requirements of both species and the protection of utilised habitat features. Management options are suggested to mitigate the impacts of road works. Differences in spatial dynamics of both frogs with overlapping habitats highlighted in this study require species-specific management approaches.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Toads.</field><field name="subject">Heleioporus Australiacus.</field><field name="subject">Pseudophryne Australis.</field><field name="subject">Endangered species.</field><field name="subject">Frogs.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/890</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies in the biology and reproductive characteristics of Pseudomugil signifer.</field><field name="creator">Howe, Effie Helena Irene</field><field name="description">The aims of this study were firstly to observe the breeding behaviour and embryo ology. and then to identify factors affecting the reproductive biology of the Australian native pseudomtlgilid Pseudomugil signifer (pacific blue-eye) and the impact upon it of the presence of the exotic species Gambusia holbrooki (eastern gambusia). Six species of the genus Pseudomugil, and the related Scaturiginichthys venneilipinnis, are found on the Australian continent. The normal breeding behaviour, egg surface morphology and embryology of four species of Pseudomugil (P. signijer, P. genrudae, P. tenellus and P. mellis) were first investigated, using aquarium and microscopic (light and S.E.M.) studies. The four species were divided into two groups: P. signifer and P. mellis; and P. tenellus and P. gertrudae. The study provided further evidence for the view that the embryology of the genus Pseudomugil differs markedly from that of members of the family Melanotaeniidae, with which the pseudomugilids have previously been grouped. The seasonal pattern of gonadal function in P. signifer, both in the field and in aquariums, was then investigated for populations of P. signifer from the Sydney region. It was found that P. signifer bred over the spring and summer months, commencing breeding as the temperature and daylength increased, and declining in breeding activity as daylength and temperature declined. There was no substantial difference in the pattern of reproductive activity between wild and captive stocks of P. signifer in the populations used. The impact of the presence of the introduced G. holbrooki on P. signifer was then examined, first in open-air tank experiments , and then in the field. In the tank experiments the exotic species profoundly affected the breeding of the native species. When G. holbrooki were in the tanks P. signifer did not gain weight or grow in total length (except for females given supplementary feed); ovarian weight and fecundity was greatly reduced and the ovaries were morphologically undeveloped. No eggs from P. signifer were observed in tanks which also housed G. holbrooki. G. holbrooki were observed to actively hunt and eat young P. signifer and to nip the caudal fins of adult P. signifer. The results indicate clearly, that at least in a captive situation, the presence of the exotic species has a very deleterious effect on breeding and hence possible survival, of a native population. A pilot study conducted at the same time as the harvest of the second tank study did not reveal such drastic consequences. However, even in the less confined field situation, some evidence of an interrelation between water quality, numbers of P. signifer and numbers of G. holbrooki were seen in one disturbed site (Home bush Bay). These findings suggest that a newly designed field experiment based on data collected from the power analysis of the pilot study could clarify whether G. holbrooki adversely affects P. signifer in the wild. The information gained from these studies can be used in the management of P. signifer in the wild, and serve as a model of the possible effects upon other native species.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pacific blue-eye.</field><field name="subject">Eastern gambusia.</field><field name="subject">Freshwater fishes.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/955</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Probiotic bacteria for hatchery production of Greenshell mussels, Perna canaliculus</field><field name="creator">Kesarcodi-Watson, Aditya</field><field name="description">The Greenshell&#8482; mussel (GSM), Perna canaliculus, industry in New Zealand (NZ) is the largest aquaculture sector in the country. In 2006, the export earnings were valued at US$145 million which represented 65% of NZ aquaculture earnings. Historically, and at present, GSM production involves the capture of wild mussels on ropes followed by on-growing of these animals to market size (approximately 14 months). However, hatchery production of GSM has been developed in recent years. Hatchery production will alleviate the seasonal uncertainties of current techniques and allow the benefits of selective breeding programs. To date, efforts to produce commercial quantities of GSM in hatcheries have been hampered by unreliable larval rearing. These problems were often alleviated by antibiotic use, which implied bacterial pathogens as the cause. Yet, the ongoing use of antibiotics is not sustainable because of increasing legislative restrictions on their use and the possible emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Hence, the identification and use of novel probiotics was investigated as an alternative. Because of a lack of previous work, it was necessary to investigate the bacterial pathogenesis of GSM larvae in the initial stages and, hence, to determine the cause of disease against which the probiotics would be active. Twenty-two bacterial strains, isolated from compromised larvae, were screened for larval toxicity using a larval bioassay. Two strains were identified as potential pathogens. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene identified Vibrio splendidus and Vibrio sp. DO1, a Vibrio coralliilyticus/neptunius-like isolate, as pathogens of GSM larvae. These strains had the- ability to cause 83 and 75% GSM larval mortality in vitro respectively, at a concentration 102 CFU ml-1. Histopathology indicated the route of infection was via the digestive system. Using healthy larvae as target hosts, Koch's postulates were confirmed for the two isolates. Although two bacterial pathogens were identified, the successful design and implementation of protective measures in the hatchery still required an understanding of the dynamics of the infection process. Developing an in situ experimental model for infection was therefore paramount. The minimum effective pathogenic dose (MEPD) of V. splendidus (105 CFU ml-1) and Vibrio sp. DO1 (106 CFU ml-1) was demonstrated for GSM larvae during hatchery production. In a flow-through water hatchery system, larvae given 1-2 hours of static water exposure with these pathogen doses, after which flowthrough processes resumed, averaged 58% and 69% cumulative mortality, respectively, on the fourth day following pathogen exposure. Larvae exposed to a dosage one order of magnitude greater than the MEPD, had higher mortalities of 73% and 96% for V. splendidus and Vibrio sp. DO1 respectively. These four levels of mortality were significantly greater than those of the non-exposed control larvae, averaging 23% in the experiments involving V. splendidus and 35% with Vibrio sp. DO1. Experiments were repeated four times to establish reproducibility. The infection models were reproducible and provided a tool to assess measures for the protection of GSM larvae against infection in the hatchery environment. A bioassay was developed to screen and select bacterial strains as potential probiotics for GSM larvae. Sixty-nine isolates originating from a GSM hatchery environment were tested for probiotic activity in larval pathogen-challenge bioassays conducted in tissue culture dishes (TCDs). Vibrio sp. DO1 and V. splendidus were the tested pathogens. Forty of the tested isolates afforded larval survival significantly greater than pathogen controls (p &lt; 0.05). The bioassay technique achieved a 58% success rate in searching for putative probiotics and highlighted the benefit of including the host animal in the first stage of the screening procedure. The time of inoculation of putative probiotic strains prior to pathogen challenge influenced the outcome of the assay. A pre-exposure period of 20 hours revealed a greater number of potential probiotics than a two-hour pre-exposure period. Pilot challenge tests, under normal hatchery conditions, confirmed the usefulness of the TCD screening method in recognising effective probiotics. Following hatchery pilot trials, two probiotic strains were chosen for further study, namely strains 0444 and 0536. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and phylogenetic analysis identified the strains as Alteromonas macleodii 0444 and Neptunomonas sp. 0536. Both probiotics were evaluated separately in a GSM hatchery facility during routine larval rearing and when the larvae were challenged with a high and low pathogenic dose of Vibrio sp. DO1 and V. splendidus. In all experiments, probiotic application significantly improved larval survival, if administered prior to pathogen exposure. Across all experiments, larvae that were exposed to the high and low dosages of pathogens averaged 14% and 36% survival respectively on the fourth day following pathogen exposure. If the probiotics were administered prior to pathogen challenge, larval survival averaged 50% and 66% respectively. Non-inoculated control larvae and larvae administered the probiotic alone demonstrated 67% and 79% survival respectively. In a repeat experiment, these benefits were reproduced, with the exception of A. macleodii 0444 trialled against V. splendidus. Neptunomonas sp. 0536 appeared to suppress naturally occurring vibrios in the culture environment of healthy GSM larvae. This was the first time A. macleodii and Neptunomonas sp. were demonstrated as probiotic bacteria. Many studies document probiotic application in aquaculture under conditions of pathogen attack, yet few describe the use of probiotics during routine production. The effects of administering the probiotic, A. macleodii 0444, during routine GSM larvae production, were compared against larvae from the same cohort that were not treated with the probiotic. The probiotic was administered daily for the first 11 days of the larval period and was provided at two concentrations, 107 CFU ml-1 and 108 CFU ml-1. Measures of larval swimming activity, gut colouration, lipid levels, larval survival, larval size and settlement success were recorded. There were minimal differences in all parameters between larvae provided the probiotic and control larvae. Probiotic treated larvae consumed more food and had higher lipid levels at the end of the larval period, but these were not statistically significant. All treatments completed the larval phase and settled successfully after metamorphosis. Survival at the end of the larval period was 37.2%, 38.8%, and 34.8% for control, 107 CFU ml-1 and 108 CFU ml-1 treatments respectively. The probiotic was still detected in larvae seven days after the final addition to the tanks. Animals were further grown in the field at a commercial farm. The probiotic was not detected in mussels at four months after leaving the hatchery. Combination use of the two probiotics, A. macleodii 0444 and Neptunomonas sp. 0536, was investigated to determine whether additive protection against pathogen attack with Vibrio sp. DO1 and V. splendidus was afforded to GSM larvae. The effects of combination administration were compared with larvae administered each probiotic as single strains and non-inoculated larvae. Additionally, two concentrations were tested for each probiotic, both singly and in combination, 107 and 108 CFU ml-1. Larvae were administered probiotics daily for the first six days, challenged with pathogens on the third day and then reared until settlement (day 19). Although protection against pathogen attack was observed in combination treatments, when compared with single-strain administration, additive protection was not apparent. Administration of 108 CFU ml-1 levels of probiotics, both singly and in combination, afforded larval survival slightly better than 107 CFU ml-1 levels, although this was rarely statistically significant. On the other hand, the higher levels of probiotic led to smaller larvae and lower feed rates for the majority of the 19-day trial. At the end of the study, larval sizes were smaller in the treatment applied a combination of probiotics at 108 CFU ml-1 than those of the other treatments. Additionally, towards the end of the larval period, feed consumption in the combination 108 CFU ml-1 treatment was similar to that witnessed in the other probiotic treatments one day previously. This suggested that either the larvae were compromised or they were growing slower. Despite a lack of additive protection against a single strain pathogen attack being demonstrated, the potential benefit of multi-strain probiotics, as prophylactic measures against every-day microbial encounters in larviculture, would remain. Although 108 CFU ml-1 levels appeared to protect against pathogen attack slightly better, they were also potentially detrimental to normal larval rearing when administered in combination. Following the successful completion of the larval period and pathogen protection afforded with a combination of probiotics at 107 CFU ml-1, this level was recommended as the best concentration of each probiotic where combination administration would be applied. The work presented in this thesis supports the use of A. macleodii 0444 and Neptunomonas sp. 0536 in the routine rearing of GSM larvae. The ability to produce settled juvenile mussels, equal in numbers to those produced in normal healthy conditions, plus the benefits against pathogen attack led to the recommendation of their use on a routine prophylactic basis in GSM larval rearing. Their use for this purpose is intended in the near future. A provisional patent has been prepared and will be submitted shortly. It is anticipated that future work will continue with these probiotic strains to determine their potential benefit for other aquaculture species.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Greenshell mussels.</field><field name="subject">Probiotics.</field><field name="subject">Aquaculture.</field><field name="subject">New Zealand.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1036</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A knowledge-based strategic theory framework for knowledge management : knowledge creation and transfer in businesses.</field><field name="creator">Duncan, Glen William</field><field name="description">University of Technology, Sydney.

However with increasing human pressures, many estuaries along the coastline of Australia have become degraded. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the effects of estuarine metal contaminants on the physiology, and the subsequent accumulation, in the smooth toadfish, Tetractenos glaber, and their prey items in estuaries in the Sydney region, south eastern Australia. Toadfish and sediments were collected during three seasonal sampling periods (June 2002, September 2002 and January 2003) in four estuaries in the Sydney region (Port Hacking River, Cowan Creek, Parramatta River and Lake Macquarie). Sediment and toadfish tissue metal concentrations varied both spatially and temporally, with highest concentrations exhibited in the metal contaminated estuaries (Lake Macquarie and Parramatta River) during spring 2002 and summer 2003. Toadfish accumulated metals in different tissue, however field experiments were limited in determining the main pathways of accumulation. Controlled laboratory kinetic experiments using radioisotopes of 109Cd and 75Se, indicated that differences in the relative contributions of water and food in the accumulation of these metals are generally governed by the physiology of the toadfish and the type of prey eaten. The distribution of metals in fish organs is important for better understanding metal kinetics and their subsequent toxicity. Toadfish exposed to 109Cd in both water or food showed a shift in distribution from gut lining at the end of the uptake phase to the excretory organs, such as liver, by the end of the loss phase, suggesting that the main uptake pathway for water exposure was via the gut and not the gills, due to fish drinking large amounts of water to maintain osmoregulation. There was no appreciable shift in the distribution of 75Se from the uptake or loss phases, being mostly associated with the excretory organs (gills, liver and kidneys). Further investigation into the accumulation of metals in toadfish prey items revealed that differences in uptake and loss of 109Cd and 75Se were influenced by their aqueous speciation, as well as differences in animal physiology, sequestration, storage and excitation mechanisms. The uptake rates and CFs of 109Cd and 75Se were highest, and the biological half-lives the longest, in pygmy mussels, ghost shrimps and polychaetes relative to the semaphore and soldier crabs. Elevated metal concentrations in certain toadfish tissues from the four estuaries were linked to reduced lipid concentrations and increased protein concentrations, which may be detrimental for growth, reproductive output and survivorship of the fish. A closer investigation into the nutritional value and metal concentrations of toadfish prey items in a selected metal contaminated estuary (Parramatta River) revealed that toadfish from the more contaminated sites within the estuary may grow faster due to higher nutritional value of prey items on a local scale, however on a larger spatial scale, this was not evident. Further investigation is required to determine whether larger toadfish size can be attributed to physiological acclimation or genetic resistance through generations of continuous metal exposure. Many studies have assessed metal concentrations in water, sediments and biota in the field, however few studies have combined both field and laboratory experiments to examine the effects of metals on fish physiology and reproduction, and metal transfer pathways in aquatic biota. This study has contributed to a better understanding of metal accumulation and its physiological effects in estuarine biota and highlights the high spatial and temporal variability in responses of organisms to environmental metal pollution.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heavy metals.</field><field name="subject">Estuarine biology.</field><field name="subject">Toadfishes.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1103</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Portfolio credit risk modelling and CDO pricing - analytics and implied trees from CDO tranches</field><field name="creator">Peng, Tao</field><field name="description">One of the most successful and most controversial innovative financial products in recent years has been collateralised debt obligations (CDOs). The dimensionality of dependency embedded in a typical CDO structure poses great challenges for researchers - in both generating realistic default dynamics and correlation, and in the mean time achieving fast and accurate model calibration. The research presented in this thesis contributes to the class of bottom-up models, which, as opposed to top-down models, start by modelling the individual obligor default process and then moving them up through the dependency structures to build up the loss distributions at the portfolio level. The Gaussian model (Li 2000) is a static copula model. It has only on correlation parameter, which can be calibrated to one CDO tranche at a time. Its simplicity achieves wide spread industry application even though it suffers from the problem of &#8217;correlation smile&#8217;. In other words, it cannot fit the market in an arbitrage-free manner in the capital-structure dimension. The first contribution of this thesis is the sensitivities analysis with regard to model parameters of expected losses of CDO tranches in the Gaussian and NIG copula models. The study provided substantial insight into the essence of the dependency structure. In addition, we apply the intensity approach to credit modelling in order to imply market distributions non-parametrically in the form of a binomial lattice. Under the same framework, we developed a series of three models. The static binomial model can be calibrated to the CDS index tranches exactly, with one set of parameters. The model can be seen as a non-parametric copula model that is arbitrage free in the capital-structure dimension. Static models are not suitable to price portfolio credit derivatives that are dynamic in nature. The static model can be naturally developed into a dynamic binomial model and satisfies no-arbitrage conditions in the time dimension. This setup, however, reduces model flexibility and calibration speed. The computational complexity comes from the non-Markovian character of the default process in the dynamic model. Inspired by Mortensen (2006), in which the author defines the intensity integral as a conditioning variable, we modify the dynamic model into a Markovian model by modelling the intensity integral directly, which greatly reduces the computational time and increases model fit in calibration. We also show that, when stochastic recovery rates are involved, there is a third no-arbitrage condition for the expected loss process that needs to be built into the Markovian model. For all binomial models, we adopt a unique optimisation algorithm for model calibration - the Cross Entropy method. It is particularly advantageous in solving large-scale non-linear optimsation problems with multiple local extrema, as encountered in our model.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Collateralised debt obligations.</field><field name="subject">Binomial coefficients.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1104</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Network controlled vertical handover for heterogeneous networks</field><field name="creator">Gami, Prashant Prabhulal</field><field name="description">Future wireless networks are expected to be a convergence of different wireless networks based on single Radio Access Technology. The aim is to provide seamless services to users any time from anywhere in the world using proper devices. In order to achieve this goal, seamless transition from one network to another with acceptable quality of service is required. Handover from one network to another is known as inter network or vertical handover. Currently known Mobile Controlled Vertical Handover schemes have some limitations. Mobile Station is limited with power and has very limited information about networks. Due to these limitations, Mobile Controlled Vertical Handover (MCVHO) can not achieve high performance in terms of hand over delay and handover decision. In this thesis, a new Network Controlled Vertical Handover (NCVHO) scheme is proposed. Proposed NCVHO scheme uses information which is available only to network along with information available to mobile node to enhance handover decision and reduce total number of handover and call dropping. NCVHO scheme also reduces the signaling on the wireless part of the network which reduces the usage of air interface. The scheme allows Point of Attachment (PoA) to make handover decision on behalf of mobile node which reduces signaling on the wireless part of the network. This change in a vertical handover scheme reduces signaling delay of the handover and achieves better handover delay performance. NCVHO scheme is reduces signaling on the air interface and uses more information to make handover decision which can achieve higher performance for number of handovers and call dropping than MCVHO. The price is paid as increased processing delay at the Point of Attachment (poA). Simulation in this thesis shows that NCVHO performance decreases at higher number of users in comparison with MCVHO. A solution to this problem is also proposed in this thesis with some modification to NCVHO scheme, a new network controlled vertical handover scheme called distributed Network Controlled Vertical Handover (distNCVHO) is proposed. The scheme achieves better performance than NCVHO scheme in terms of handover delay, number of handovers and call dropping. It is noticed in this thesis that more information available from the network can enhance handover decision which can in turn reduce total number of handovers with a large margin. Information such as network load, network properties such as coverage, available bandwidth can play a vital role in the handover decision making. Reduced usage of air interface can allow network to perform handover faster and reduce number of total handover attempts.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Moving to the coast : internal migration and place contestation in Northern New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Kijas, Johanna</field><field name="description">University of Technology, Sydney.

A.</field><field name="description">This dissertation explores the influences on individual decision making in a complex, real world context &#8211; the New Zealand wool supply chain. It asks two fundamental questions, first, how do decision makers make decisions in their everyday settings and, second, how is decision making learned and improved through experience and contextual factors. Two contextual aspects of decision making were also examined; these included whether decision making processes varied as a result of uncertainty and risky surroundings, or in cooperative and competitive environments. Further examination included revealing how being a member of a (multi-layered) group influences individual decision making. In-depth qualitative interviewing of sheep farmers, and associated supply chain members in the wool industry was undertaken. Three key decision journeys were explored from both the 'psychological' and the 'social' schools of social psychology in order to give detail on the flow of decision making influences through human systems (whether entities were present, or implied). One of the main aspects of this study was to employ, by analogy, an analysis inspired by the concept of multi-level selection from evolutionary theory as a means of understanding decision making in such a complex, layered system. Other contributions include commentary on the nature of social psychological studies of decision making, suggestions for the expansion of naturalistic decision making to include processes occurring on more than one 'level' of context, the framing of information in the media and the judgment of information sources on the part of experienced and inexperienced farmers, and, the role that globalization may play in driving decision making behaviour.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">wool supply chain</field><field name="subject">naturalistic decision making</field><field name="subject">uncertainty</field><field name="subject">rational-analytical approaches</field><field name="subject">intuition</field><field name="subject">social psychology</field><field name="subject">multi-level selection</field><field name="subject">agribusiness chains</field><field name="subject">170113 - Social and Community Psychology</field><field name="subject">070106 - Farm Management, Rural Management and Agribusiness</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/2156</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An advancement in analytical modelling of soil-infilled rock joints and their practical applications</field><field name="creator">Oliveira, David Americo Fortuna</field><field name="description">An infilled rock joint is likely to be the weakest plane in a rock mass. The most pronounced effect of the presence of infill material is the reduction in friction of the discontinuity boundaries (i.e. rock to rock contact of the joint walls). The thicker the infill, the smaller the shear strength of the rock joint. Once the infill reaches a critical thickness, the joint walls (rock) play no significant role in the overall shear strength. Several models have been proposed to predict the peak shear strength of infilled joints under both constant normal load (CNL) and constant normal stiffness (CNS) boundary conditions, taking into account the ratio of infill thickness (t) to the height of the joint wall asperity (a), i.e. the t/a ratio. Models based on the CNS condition provide a much better accuracy of the infilled joint behaviour in the field, but only a limited number of studies have focused on the more realistic CNS stress-strain behaviour. This study presents a critical review of some of the earlier studies and the most recent advancement of a shear-strength model developed at University of Wollongong, Australia, supplemented with laboratory data for model validation. The effect of different factors on the shear behaviour such as the t/a ratio, infill friction angle, joint wall roughness, joint stiffness, and type of infill are presented. In addition the implication of soil-infilled joint on rock mass behaviour is investigated through extensive practical applications both analytical and numerical. The new set of proposed discontinuity strength and deformation relationships can be used as an alternative approach in design. Although the proposed soil-infilled joint model still suffers from inevitable limitations such as the empirical parameters that need further calibration with experimental data, the study vividly demonstrates its practical value with respect to underground excavation and slope stability in jointed rock mass.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3085</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecophysiology of salt- and waterlogging tolerance in selected species of Halosarcia</field><field name="creator">English, Jeremy Parker</field><field name="description">&lt;abstract&gt;</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chenopodiaceae -- Ecophysiology -- Western Australia -- Hannan Lake</field><field name="subject">Chenopodiaceae -- Effect of salt on -- Western Australia -- Hannan Lake</field><field name="subject">Chenopodiaceae -- Effect of water levels on -- Western Australia -- Hannan Lake</field><field name="subject">Halophytes -- Ecophysiology -- Western Australia -- Hannan Lake</field><field name="subject">Halophytes -- Effect of salt on -- Western Australia -- Hannan Lake</field><field name="subject">Halophytes -- Effect of water levels on -- Western Australia -- Hannan Lake</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0075</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adolescent onset anorexia nervosa : a model for the effects of inadequate nutrition upon bone size and development</field><field name="creator">Turner, Justine Marie</field><field name="description">Despite usual onset during adolescence the cause of low bone density in adolescent onset anorexia nervosa is incompletely understood. Puberty is known to be a crucial time for the development of peak bone mass, due principally to growth plate bone formation and modelling on preformed surfaces. This results in bone formation uncoupled from bone resorption leading to increased bone size due to increase in matrix and bone mineral content. It was hypothesized that low bone density in adolescent anorexia nervosa was caused by malnutrition during puberty suppressing normal bone matrix formation at all sites of bone formation thus arresting bone mineralization. Method 49 female adolescents with anorexia nervosa and 109 healthy female adolescent controls were studied. 22 of the anorexia nervosa subjects were studied again a year later. Bone area, mineral content and density were measured using Dual Xray Absorptiometry at the spine, hip and whole body sites, including body composition assessment. Estimated volumetric bone density was calculated using published equations in order to study bone density independent of bone size. Height, weight and Tanner stage in puberty were measured. Dietary intake and physical exercise were assessed using questionnaires. In a subset of anorexia nervosa and control subjects bone age was measured. In a subset of anorexia nervosa subjects bone formation was assessed using serum bone specific alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, and bone resorption was assessed using urine N-telopeptide.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anorexia nervosa</field><field name="subject">Anorexia in children</field><field name="subject">Bones -- Growth</field><field name="subject">Health behavior in adolescence</field><field name="subject">Anorexia nervosa</field><field name="subject">Bone accrual</field><field name="subject">Bone mass</field><field name="subject">Malnutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0131</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial and temporal dynamics of Australian rainforests</field><field name="creator">Melinda Laidlaw</field><field name="description">Abstract The loss of tropical and subtropical rainforest biodiversity due to increasing anthropogenic pressure lends urgency to understanding the processes which drive species coexistence. Without an understanding of how species are distributed across the landscape and how species assemblages change through time, we cannot derive appropriate management regimes for their persistence. This thesis examines the role of deterministic drivers of spatial and temporal dynamics of Australian rainforests and investigates the potential impacts of a changing climate on Australian rainforests. The findings from three studies are presented in four chapters which examine floristic turnover in situ and at catchment, regional and continental scales. Compositional turnover in tropical rainforest following the passage of a category three cyclone was examined both at five years&#8217; post-cyclone recovery and in the context of local and regional spatial turnover. After five years, the forest remained in an active state of recovery with an approximate 30% increase in stems, 5% decrease in basal area and a 16% increase in species richness. Local spatial turnover suggests differential impacts of cyclones over even short distances and overall, a high degree of temporal stability in these rainforests, despite the impact of frequent catastrophic disturbances. Compositional turnover in subtropical rainforest along steep moisture and temperature gradients was investigated and described along an altitudinal transect in subtropical rainforest. The identification of significant modelled climatic and mapped soil variables suggests that moisture stress is an important driver of floristic turnover in these forests. Existing high levels of turnover across tree assemblages from low to mid elevations in subtropical rainforest were identified. Such turnover is greatly reduced at higher elevations. With increasing atmospheric temperatures, the cloud cap is expected to rise and we predict that subtropical rainforest communities which currently sit at the level of the cloud base (800-900m) will experience increasing in situ floristic turnover. Our findings agree with predictions for cloud forests elsewhere: high elevation endemic species will face an increasing risk of extinction as mesic climatic envelopes move upslope out of reach. Baseline data from this study will be used as a benchmark against which to formulate and test hypotheses for climate induced floristic and structural shift. It is also acknowledged that monitoring floristic turnover as a surrogate of shifting climatic envelopes may be confounded both by a lack of knowledge regarding the underlying turnover rates of rainforest communities and by the disparity in temporal scales of tree community turnover and accelerating anthropogenic climate change. Finally, generalized dissimilarity modelling is utilised to combine disparate biological survey data and remotely sensed environmental data to investigate the determinants of floristic turnover at the regional scale. Generalized dissimilarity modelling identified four environmental predictors of &#946;-diversity in subtropical rainforest, all closely linked with moisture stress: radiation of the driest quarter, precipitation of the driest period, slope and aspect. Ten land classes were identified and mapped for the Mt Warning Caldera and may act as appropriate management units for future climate change planning within the region. This thesis has identified a potential threat to the biodiversity of Australian rainforests under a changing climate. Increasing levels of evapotranspiration, moisture stress and an increased return rate and intensity of disturbance are predicted to lead to the upslope movement of species ranges, increasing levels of in situ floristic turnover, and will likely result in the emergence of novel rainforest communities not present under current conditions. The potential for anthropogenic climate change to impact upon native vegetation communities has emphasised the need for the continuation and expansion of monitoring programs and the development of dynamic management regimes.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">&#946;-diversity</field><field name="subject">climate change</field><field name="subject">cloud</field><field name="subject">climate</field><field name="subject">compositional turnover</field><field name="subject">determinism</field><field name="subject">distance</field><field name="subject">environmental surrogacy</field><field name="subject">soils</field><field name="subject">topography</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206170</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rhys Test Thesis</field><field name="creator">Mr Rhys Palmer</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:152830</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD.

Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using emergent technologies to develop sustainable architectural composites</field><field name="creator">Palmer, Fleur</field><field name="description">The intention of this project is to research the potential of emergent technologies for developing sustainable composites for the building industry. It is divided into three parts: Part 1 Identifies emergent practices which are being applied to the development of new sustainable building prototypes such as developments using nanotechnologies, the influence of biomimetics, the development of intelligent interactive systems and the use of digital technologies to generate complex cellular structural systems. Part 2 Outlines existing processes involved in selecting and manufacturing prototypes, as many existing processes have been opportunistically applied to emergent practices to generate innovative sustainable prototypes. Part 3 By synthesising the research gathered in the previous parts of this thesis, this section documents the design process for developing a sustainable building system. The design is based on a minimal surface structure to reduce materiality and to optimise strength and its manufacturing process exploits emergent and existing technologies for its generation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Minimal surface structures</field><field name="subject">Sustainable architecture</field><field name="subject">Emergent technologies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/933</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Energy expenditure and enjoyment of active video games vs. other activities in 10-12 year old boys</field><field name="creator">White, Kathleen</field><field name="description">Children are becoming more inactive and are spending a significant proportion of their time participating in screen-time sedentary behaviours. New generation active video games may provide an opportunity to convert traditional sedentary screen-time into active screen-time. The aims of this thesis were to: 1) determine the metabolic costs of different activities; 2) determine whether experience and fitness influence the metabolic costs of active video games; and 3) determine children's enjoyment of active video games. Accordingly, this thesis is presented as two papers. Twenty-six boys' (11.4 &#177; 0.8 yr) participated in the study. Each performed sedentary activities (resting, watching television and sedentary gaming), active video games (Nintendo&#174; Wii Bowling, Boxing, Tennis, Skiing and Step Aerobics), traditional physical activities (walking and running) and a maximal fitness test. During all activities oxygen uptake and heart rate were measured and energy expenditure (EE) calculated. The active video games resulted in a significantly higher EE compared to rest (63-190%, p&lt;0.05). No significant differences in EE were found between the most active video games (Wii Boxing and Wii Step) and walking. The intensities of the active video games were low (&#8804; 3 METSmeas). There was no evidence to suggest that gaming experience or aerobic fitness influenced EE during active video game play. Using the same sample, the aim was to determine the participants' enjoyment of active video games sedentary activities and physical activities. Participants' enjoyment was measured using the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale immediately after the activities. The percentages of children that enjoyed each activity were: walking (39%), television (58%), running (60%), PS3 (73%), Wii Boxing (88%), Wii Tennis (77%), Wii Fit (75%) and Wii Bowling (89%). The active video games were the most enjoyable activities irrespective of participants' weight status, fitness and experience. The metabolic costs of active video games suggest that they may be suitable for future interventions which are aimed at decreasing time spent in sedentary behaviour. However, as they are low intensity activities, active video game play time should not be accumulated as part of the 60-minutes of daily moderate to vigorous physical activity that is currently recommended for children.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">active video games</field><field name="subject">physical activity</field><field name="subject">sedentary behaviour</field><field name="subject">energy expenditure</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/934</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing change as a Minister of the Crown</field><field name="creator">Gair, George Frederick</field><field name="description">During my years as a Cabinet Minister in New Zealand, the relationship between a Minister and his key officials was strongly modelled on the Westminster system as then applied in Britain. As in Britain, the ministers were the product of the political and parliamentary processes. The leader of the political party with the majority in the House was called upon by the Queen's representative (our Governor General) to form the new Government. All Ministerial appointees were necessarily chosen entirely from members then in Parliament. As in Britain, also, the key officials to serve each Minister in their portfolios were provided by the career Public Service, the long-serving body of officials who were there to advise and manage the system for successive governments. The Minister did not choose his departmental head, nor did that departmental head choose his minister. There were many assumptions inherited from the past which helped to make the relationship work. Policy decisions were shaped by the Minister representing the political side of the equation. Execution and management was carried out by the head official, responsible for the operation of the bureaucratic machine he headed. In explaining my thesis message - "Managing Change as a Minister of the Crown" - a very strong autobiographical dimension to my experience and comments is inevitable. In the political setting, the relationship between Minister and Head of Department, though a key factor, is but one of many. All change affects many people - some positively and beneficially, and some the reverse. The effects of change can be anticipated rather than actually felt. Perceptions can sometimes become bigger problems to manage than realised consequences. Change in politics invariably reaches out far beyond those obviously and directly affected. Handling change therefore involves making plans for how one can best point the change in a forward-looking and constructive way, and put a socially positive spin on one's efforts and the outcome. If one's efforts are done openly, and one's arguments are well founded, real progress can be made. One of life's constants is change itself. It affects us all in some measure. In communities categorized as "developed", it can be particularly fast and sweeping. This means, inevitably, that the forms of its infrastructures - from public services to business enterprises - which enable society and the economy to function effectively must adapt, and constructively, to those changes. From my experience, in facing a variety of problems calling for change in handling portfolio responsibilities, I have found every case is different from the others, and each solution had to be shaped to meet the characteristics of that particular case. The only common denominator I would call the "people factor". Compounding the challenge, that "people factor" had to be fashioned as appropriate for the personalities with whom I was working, and the characteristics of the problem being addressed. I did, however, find that there were some common fundamentals in the "people factor" which I address in my conclusion. They helped facilitate co-operation in managing change.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Change management as a Minister</field><field name="subject">Autobiography</field><field name="subject">Autobiographical research method</field><field name="subject">Energy administration</field><field name="subject">Energy sector</field><field name="subject">Case studies</field><field name="subject">Government responsibilities</field><field name="subject">Paperwork before information technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/936</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pathways to principalship</field><field name="creator">Dalgleish, Alison</field><field name="description">A qualitative descriptive approach was undertaken to research what was available within the areas of advice and guidance for potential principals who wish to achieve the position of principal at secondary schools in Aotearoa New Zealand. The literature review for this study uncovered very little in the way of New Zealand-based professional advice and guidance for potential principals, despite there being some leadership development programmes such as the Principal Preparation Programmes for Aspiring Principals (University of Auckland, Centre for Educational Leadership). However, the international literature revealed a greater wealth of data on existing principal preparation programmes, and the phenomenon of leadership. In terms of the methodology, case studies and interviews of six participants were undertaken. Six current principals of provincial North Island secondary schools in New Zealand were interviewed face-to-face. Their stories were audio-taped and transcribed. The interviews were essentially rich narratives of leadership stories and were somewhat akin to individual case studies of the participants' own leadership and principal development. Content and thematic analysis of the data revealed eight aspects of principal development which were distilled to four main themes: historical career pathway; managing the journey; handing over the knowledge; and personal costs to the participants. The findings from this research showed that few principals followed planned career pathways or had access to advice, guidance or formal training for principalship. Participants generally gained principal positions through good luck rather than good management. The increasing complexity of the principal's role, combined with a projected shortage of competent candidates, requires that preparation for principalship needs to be implemented as a well-structured, rigorous programme. A framework for such a programme is proposed.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Principalship</field><field name="subject">Pathways</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/935</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Amino acid racemization geochronology - contributions to the understanding of Quaternary sea-level changes, neotectonics and coastal evolution.</field><field name="creator">Murray-Wallace, Colin Vincent</field><field name="description">Title page, table of contents and abstract only.

The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of milk protein ingredients on physico-chemical properties of rice starch : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology at Massey University Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Noisuwan, Angkana</field><field name="description">The overall aim of this thesis is to determine if the interactions between normal and waxy rice starch and milk proteins from four milk protein ingredients, namely skim milk powder (SMP), milk protein concentrate (MPC), sodium caseinate (NaCAS) and whey protein isolate (WPI) do occur, and to identify the mechanisms underlying these interactions. Different milk protein ingredients at various concentrations (0 to 10%, w/w) affected markedly and differently the pasting behaviour of 10% (w/w) rice starches. SMP delayed the pasting of both rice starches by increasing the onset temperature (Tonset) and the peak viscosity temperature (Tpeak) of pasting. This was mainly due to the presence of lactose and ions, which was further supported by the investigation of the effects of UFSMP (a solution of salts and lactose present in SMP at their proper concentration) and lactose. The addition of NaCAS also delayed the pasting of rice starch; Tpeak in the case of both starches was increased. For normal rice starch paste, MPC and WPI decreased the Tpeak. MPC had no affect on Tpeak of waxy rice starch paste. The qualitative viscoelastic behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient gels obtained from the above pastes was dominated by the continuous phase made of the starch molecules. There was evidence, as indicated by confocal microscopy, of phase separation between the milk proteins of SMP and MPC and the two starches. The phase separation was not observed in the addition of either NaCAS or WPI. Studies on the thermal behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient mixtures by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that SMP, similarly to UFSMP, delayed the gelatinization of both starches. NaCAS also delayed the gelatinisation of both starches but had a greater effect on waxy than normal rice starch. The addition of NaCAS did not affect Tonset but increased Tpeak for normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinisation temperature of waxy rice starch was highly affected by the addition of NaCAS with both Tonset and Tpeak shifted to higher temperatures. MPC had no affect on the gelatinization temperature of normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinization temperature of waxy rice starch was increased by the addition of MPC. The addition of WPI to both rice starches showed two thermal transitions. The first of these was due to the gelatinisation of the starches and the second to the denaturation of &#223;-lactoglobulin (&#223;-lg). The addition of WPI to normal rice starch showed that the thermal behaviour of normal starch and protein were independent from each other. In contrast, the thermal behaviour of waxy rice starch was modified by the addition of WPI; both Tonset and Tpeak were increased. SMP decreased the Tonset of swelling, swelling ratio and the amount of starch leaching from both starches. These observed changes were due to the presence of lactose and ions in SMP. NaCAS slightly increased Tonset of swelling but the amount of starch leaching was reduced for both rice starches. The rigidity of both starches tended to increase in the presence of NaCAS. MPC and WPI affected the swelling behaviour of normal and waxy rice starch differently. A dramatic increase in the swelling of normal rice starch/MPC or WPI mixtures was observed, whereas this trend was not evident for waxy rice starch/ MPC or WPI mixtures. The difference in the water holding ability and gelatinization peak temperatures of the two starches over the temperature range at which whey proteins denature and form gels are believed to be responsible for the observed differences. The results from confocal microscopy showed that milk proteins, such as a-casein, &#223;- casein, &#223;-lg and a-lactalbumin (a-la), were adsorbed onto the granule surface of both normal and waxy rice starch. The mechanism for this adsorption is the hydrophilic interactions; hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl group from terminated glucan molecule that protrude around starch granule surface-hydroxyl; amino, or other electron-donation or electron-accepting groups of the added proteins. Using sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) it was found that for SMP and MPC the adsorbed as- to &#223;-casein ratio on both starches was similar to the as-casein to &#223;- casein ratio in the casein micelle at low SMP and MPC concentrations. But at high concentrations of SMP or MPC, this ratio decreased indicating that more &#223;-casein was adsorbed preferentially to as-casein. In the case of NaCAS, as-casein was adsorbed preferentially to &#223;-casein. Moreover, there was evidence of multilayer adsorption of ascasein into the surface of rice starch granules. Compared to the other milk protein ingredients, very small amounts of the &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI were adsorbed onto starch granules. However, the adsorbed amounts of &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI continuously increased with increasing WPI concentration, suggesting that these two proteins, particularly &#223;-lg, adsorbed in multilayers too.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">waxy rice starch</field><field name="subject">lactoglobulin</field><field name="subject">gelatinazation</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290104 Other food sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who talks, what they talk about, and how much they say : a study of bulletin structure and source use in New Zealand free-to-air television news programmes : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management in Communication Management, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Macdonald, Julie Susan</field><field name="description">Free-to-air television news is an accessible and popular means through which audiences can gain knowledge and understanding about the world. Therefore, the nature of the news provided has important implications for the opportunities audiences have to become informed about events and issues, and to use this knowledge to participate in social decision-making. The structure and content of news bulletins reflect the decisions made by broadcasters about the topics that are considered to be important, and which sources should have the opportunity to be represented. Thus, the goal of this research was to compare the structure and content of the news provided by New Zealand&#8217;s national free-to-air news programmes; ONE News (TVNZ), 3 News (TV3), Prime News (Prime Television), and Te K ea (M ori Television). A content analysis of one constructed week of the four news programmes was undertaken, focusing on four general areas of interest. First, the profile of the news bulletins was examined (i.e., the proportion of the bulletin allocated to different segments of the news, the duration of main news stories, the origin of production of main news stories, the proportion of New Zealand and international news, and the topics included in the news). Second, the research investigated the identity of the types of sources selected by the broadcasters for inclusion in locally produced main news stories. Third, the frequency and duration of &#233;lite and non-&#233;lite source speech was examined. Finally, the extent to which journalists speak on camera in news stories was also investigated. The study showed that the four programmes generally conformed to the &#8216;standard profile&#8217; of modern television news bulletins; the programmes included considerable amounts of non-news content and the news topics often reflected entertainment values, rather than focusing on serious issues. A further significant characteristic of the bulletins was that &#233;lite sources were more likely to be included in news stories on all programmes and generally had greater opportunities to speak. However, in many respects it appears that Te K ea provides an alternative news bulletin compared to the other three channels, by focusing on a wider range of news topics, including more non-&#233;lite sources in stories, and giving all sources considerably more time to share their views. Te K ea seems to broadcast a news programme that makes a compromise between the entertainment values which are entrenched in contemporary television news, and the broader M ori Television mandate to inform and educate the public. This contrasts with the more homogenous (in terms of the characteristics examined in this research) news programmes offered by the ONE News, 3 News, and Prime News. This study concludes that the nationally available free-to-air news programmes currently broadcast on New Zealand television fulfil the traditional news functions of informing and educating the public in only a very narrow sense. The deregulated news environment is poised to undergo further transformation with an anticipated increase in convergence among news media and the emergence of more television news providers. The challenge within this commercial environment is for ONE News, 3 News, Prime News, and Te K ea to deliver on their stated commitments to provide information and promote debate on the important issues of the day.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">news bulletins</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">public broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rheo-NMR studies of macromolecules : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Physics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kakubayashi, Motoko</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the effects of simple shear flow on macromolecular structure and interactions are investigated in detail via a combination of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and rheology, namely Rheo-NMR. A specially designed NMR couette shear cell and benchtop shear cell, developed in-house, demonstrated that the direct measurement of the above phenomena is possible. First, to determine whether the shear cells were creating simple shear flow, results were reproduced from literature studies of liquid crystal systems which report shear effects on: Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) in deuterium oxide, and Poly(gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PBLG) in m-cresol. Next, the possible conformational changes to protein structure brought about by shear were investigated by applying shear to Bovine  -lactogobulin ( -Lg). As the protein was sheared, a small, irreversible conformational change was observed by means of one-dimensional and two-dimensional 1H NMR with reasonable reproducibility. However, no observable change was detected by means of light scattering. A large conformational change was observed after shearing a destabilized  -Lg sample containing 10% Trifluoroethanol (TFE) (v/v). From an NMR point of view, the sheared state was similar to the structure of  -Lg containing large amounts of  -helices and, interestingly, similar to the structure of  -Lg containing  -sheet amyloid fibrils. Gel electrophoresis tests suggested that the changes were caused by hydrophobic interactions. Unfortunately, this proved to be difficult to reproduce. The effect of shear on an inter-macromolecular interaction was investigated by applying shear during an enzyme reaction of pectin methylesterase (PME) on pectin. Experimental method and analysis developments are described in detail. It was observed that under the conditions studied, shear does not interfere with the de-esterification of pectin with two types of PME, which have different action mechanisms at average shear rates up to 1570 s-1.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">macromolecular structure</field><field name="subject">shear</field><field name="subject">pectin</field><field name="subject">protein interactions</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240300 Atomic and Molecular Physics; Nuclear and Particle Physics, Plasma Physics::240301 Atomic and molecular physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reflecting diversity or selecting viewpoints : an analysis of the GM debate in New Zealand's media 1998-2002 : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of PhD in Communication at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ashwell, Douglas James</field><field name="description">The advent of genetically modified (GM) food in New Zealand in 1998 saw the beginning of a highly politicised debate about GM use in the country. The concern over GM and the political situation after the 1999 general election saw the Government establish a Royal Commission of Inquiry on Genetic Modification in May, 2000. The Royal Commission and strong public opposition to GM, evident in large public protests and other actions, made the issue highly newsworthy. The aim of this study was to explore how newspapers reported the GM debate, in particular, examining whether the reportage facilitated greater public debate and awareness about GM through journalists adhering to the ideals of the theory of social responsibility and enacting their watchdog role as encapsulated in the Fourth Estate tradition of the media. To achieve these aims the overall tone of the reportage and also which news source types and themes were most frequently reported were examined. In addition, the relationship and perceptions of scientists and journalists involved in the reporting were explored to examine how these relationships may have influenced the reportage. Content analysis showed the reportage had a pro-GM bias with policy-makers, scientists and industry spokespeople the most frequently cited news sources. The themes of Science, Economics and Politics dominated the reportage. Other source types and themes were less represented, especially themes dealing with ethical and environmental arguments. This lack of representation occurred despite the Royal Commission offering a space for all interested parties to speak. The interviews illustrated that scientists believed the quality of newspaper coverage of GM lacked depth and that important issues were unreported. Journalists found the issue complex to report and said they took care not to oversimplify the science and issues surrounding GM. The relationship between scientists and journalists indicated particular tensions existing between the two groups. The thesis concludes that if robust public debate is to occur within New Zealand regarding GM and other scientific developments, then the media should reflect a greater diversity of opinion by citing other potential news sources offering alternative arguments based on, for example, ethical or environmental grounds.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">journalism viewpoints</field><field name="subject">newspaper report evaluation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::289900 Other Information, Computing and Communication Sciences ::289999 Other information, computing and communication sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An embarrassment of riches : rekindling desire for obsolete furniture : a exegesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Design, Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Neale, Wendy</field><field name="description">This exegesis tells the story of my Master of Design project, Embarrassment of Riches.

Six species of the genus Pseudomugil, and the related Scaturiginichthys venneilipinnis, are found on the Australian continent. The normal breeding behaviour, egg surface morphology and embryology of four species of Pseudomugil (P. signijer, P. genrudae, P. tenellus and P. mellis) were first investigated, using aquarium and microscopic (light and S.E.M.) studies. The four species were divided into two groups: P. signifer and P. mellis; and P. tenellus and P. gertrudae. The study provided further evidence for the view that the embryology of the genus Pseudomugil differs markedly from that of members of the family Melanotaeniidae, with which the pseudomugilids have previously been grouped. The seasonal pattern of gonadal function in P. signifer, both in the field and in aquariums, was then investigated for populations of P. signifer from the Sydney region. It was found that P. signifer bred over the spring and summer months, commencing breeding as the temperature and daylength increased, and declining in breeding activity as daylength and temperature declined. There was no substantial difference in the pattern of reproductive activity between wild and captive stocks of P. signifer in the populations used. The impact of the presence of the introduced G. holbrooki on P. signifer was then examined, first in open-air tank experiments , and then in the field. In the tank experiments the exotic species profoundly affected the breeding of the native species. When G. holbrooki were in the tanks P. signifer did not gain weight or grow in total length (except for females given supplementary feed); ovarian weight and fecundity was greatly reduced and the ovaries were morphologically undeveloped. No eggs from P. signifer were observed in tanks which also housed G. holbrooki. G. holbrooki were observed to actively hunt and eat young P. signifer and to nip the caudal fins of adult P. signifer. The results indicate clearly, that at least in a captive situation, the presence of the exotic species has a very deleterious effect on breeding and hence possible survival, of a native population. A pilot study conducted at the same time as the harvest of the second tank study did not reveal such drastic consequences. However, even in the less confined field situation, some evidence of an interrelation between water quality, numbers of P. signifer and numbers of G. holbrooki were seen in one disturbed site (Home bush Bay). These findings suggest that a newly designed field experiment based on data collected from the power analysis of the pilot study could clarify whether G. holbrooki adversely affects P. signifer in the wild. The information gained from these studies can be used in the management of P. signifer in the wild, and serve as a model of the possible effects upon other native species.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pacific blue-eye.</field><field name="subject">Eastern gambusia.</field><field name="subject">Freshwater fishes.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/955</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Probiotic bacteria for hatchery production of Greenshell mussels, Perna canaliculus</field><field name="creator">Kesarcodi-Watson, Aditya</field><field name="description">The Greenshell&#8482; mussel (GSM), Perna canaliculus, industry in New Zealand (NZ) is the largest aquaculture sector in the country. In 2006, the export earnings were valued at US$145 million which represented 65% of NZ aquaculture earnings. Historically, and at present, GSM production involves the capture of wild mussels on ropes followed by on-growing of these animals to market size (approximately 14 months). However, hatchery production of GSM has been developed in recent years. Hatchery production will alleviate the seasonal uncertainties of current techniques and allow the benefits of selective breeding programs. To date, efforts to produce commercial quantities of GSM in hatcheries have been hampered by unreliable larval rearing. These problems were often alleviated by antibiotic use, which implied bacterial pathogens as the cause. Yet, the ongoing use of antibiotics is not sustainable because of increasing legislative restrictions on their use and the possible emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Hence, the identification and use of novel probiotics was investigated as an alternative. Because of a lack of previous work, it was necessary to investigate the bacterial pathogenesis of GSM larvae in the initial stages and, hence, to determine the cause of disease against which the probiotics would be active. Twenty-two bacterial strains, isolated from compromised larvae, were screened for larval toxicity using a larval bioassay. Two strains were identified as potential pathogens. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene identified Vibrio splendidus and Vibrio sp. DO1, a Vibrio coralliilyticus/neptunius-like isolate, as pathogens of GSM larvae. These strains had the- ability to cause 83 and 75% GSM larval mortality in vitro respectively, at a concentration 102 CFU ml-1. Histopathology indicated the route of infection was via the digestive system. Using healthy larvae as target hosts, Koch's postulates were confirmed for the two isolates. Although two bacterial pathogens were identified, the successful design and implementation of protective measures in the hatchery still required an understanding of the dynamics of the infection process. Developing an in situ experimental model for infection was therefore paramount. The minimum effective pathogenic dose (MEPD) of V. splendidus (105 CFU ml-1) and Vibrio sp. DO1 (106 CFU ml-1) was demonstrated for GSM larvae during hatchery production. In a flow-through water hatchery system, larvae given 1-2 hours of static water exposure with these pathogen doses, after which flowthrough processes resumed, averaged 58% and 69% cumulative mortality, respectively, on the fourth day following pathogen exposure. Larvae exposed to a dosage one order of magnitude greater than the MEPD, had higher mortalities of 73% and 96% for V. splendidus and Vibrio sp. DO1 respectively. These four levels of mortality were significantly greater than those of the non-exposed control larvae, averaging 23% in the experiments involving V. splendidus and 35% with Vibrio sp. DO1. Experiments were repeated four times to establish reproducibility. The infection models were reproducible and provided a tool to assess measures for the protection of GSM larvae against infection in the hatchery environment. A bioassay was developed to screen and select bacterial strains as potential probiotics for GSM larvae. Sixty-nine isolates originating from a GSM hatchery environment were tested for probiotic activity in larval pathogen-challenge bioassays conducted in tissue culture dishes (TCDs). Vibrio sp. DO1 and V. splendidus were the tested pathogens. Forty of the tested isolates afforded larval survival significantly greater than pathogen controls (p &lt; 0.05). The bioassay technique achieved a 58% success rate in searching for putative probiotics and highlighted the benefit of including the host animal in the first stage of the screening procedure. The time of inoculation of putative probiotic strains prior to pathogen challenge influenced the outcome of the assay. A pre-exposure period of 20 hours revealed a greater number of potential probiotics than a two-hour pre-exposure period. Pilot challenge tests, under normal hatchery conditions, confirmed the usefulness of the TCD screening method in recognising effective probiotics. Following hatchery pilot trials, two probiotic strains were chosen for further study, namely strains 0444 and 0536. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and phylogenetic analysis identified the strains as Alteromonas macleodii 0444 and Neptunomonas sp. 0536. Both probiotics were evaluated separately in a GSM hatchery facility during routine larval rearing and when the larvae were challenged with a high and low pathogenic dose of Vibrio sp. DO1 and V. splendidus. In all experiments, probiotic application significantly improved larval survival, if administered prior to pathogen exposure. Across all experiments, larvae that were exposed to the high and low dosages of pathogens averaged 14% and 36% survival respectively on the fourth day following pathogen exposure. If the probiotics were administered prior to pathogen challenge, larval survival averaged 50% and 66% respectively. Non-inoculated control larvae and larvae administered the probiotic alone demonstrated 67% and 79% survival respectively. In a repeat experiment, these benefits were reproduced, with the exception of A. macleodii 0444 trialled against V. splendidus. Neptunomonas sp. 0536 appeared to suppress naturally occurring vibrios in the culture environment of healthy GSM larvae. This was the first time A. macleodii and Neptunomonas sp. were demonstrated as probiotic bacteria. Many studies document probiotic application in aquaculture under conditions of pathogen attack, yet few describe the use of probiotics during routine production. The effects of administering the probiotic, A. macleodii 0444, during routine GSM larvae production, were compared against larvae from the same cohort that were not treated with the probiotic. The probiotic was administered daily for the first 11 days of the larval period and was provided at two concentrations, 107 CFU ml-1 and 108 CFU ml-1. Measures of larval swimming activity, gut colouration, lipid levels, larval survival, larval size and settlement success were recorded. There were minimal differences in all parameters between larvae provided the probiotic and control larvae. Probiotic treated larvae consumed more food and had higher lipid levels at the end of the larval period, but these were not statistically significant. All treatments completed the larval phase and settled successfully after metamorphosis. Survival at the end of the larval period was 37.2%, 38.8%, and 34.8% for control, 107 CFU ml-1 and 108 CFU ml-1 treatments respectively. The probiotic was still detected in larvae seven days after the final addition to the tanks. Animals were further grown in the field at a commercial farm. The probiotic was not detected in mussels at four months after leaving the hatchery. Combination use of the two probiotics, A. macleodii 0444 and Neptunomonas sp. 0536, was investigated to determine whether additive protection against pathogen attack with Vibrio sp. DO1 and V. splendidus was afforded to GSM larvae. The effects of combination administration were compared with larvae administered each probiotic as single strains and non-inoculated larvae. Additionally, two concentrations were tested for each probiotic, both singly and in combination, 107 and 108 CFU ml-1. Larvae were administered probiotics daily for the first six days, challenged with pathogens on the third day and then reared until settlement (day 19). Although protection against pathogen attack was observed in combination treatments, when compared with single-strain administration, additive protection was not apparent. Administration of 108 CFU ml-1 levels of probiotics, both singly and in combination, afforded larval survival slightly better than 107 CFU ml-1 levels, although this was rarely statistically significant. On the other hand, the higher levels of probiotic led to smaller larvae and lower feed rates for the majority of the 19-day trial. At the end of the study, larval sizes were smaller in the treatment applied a combination of probiotics at 108 CFU ml-1 than those of the other treatments. Additionally, towards the end of the larval period, feed consumption in the combination 108 CFU ml-1 treatment was similar to that witnessed in the other probiotic treatments one day previously. This suggested that either the larvae were compromised or they were growing slower. Despite a lack of additive protection against a single strain pathogen attack being demonstrated, the potential benefit of multi-strain probiotics, as prophylactic measures against every-day microbial encounters in larviculture, would remain. Although 108 CFU ml-1 levels appeared to protect against pathogen attack slightly better, they were also potentially detrimental to normal larval rearing when administered in combination. Following the successful completion of the larval period and pathogen protection afforded with a combination of probiotics at 107 CFU ml-1, this level was recommended as the best concentration of each probiotic where combination administration would be applied. The work presented in this thesis supports the use of A. macleodii 0444 and Neptunomonas sp. 0536 in the routine rearing of GSM larvae. The ability to produce settled juvenile mussels, equal in numbers to those produced in normal healthy conditions, plus the benefits against pathogen attack led to the recommendation of their use on a routine prophylactic basis in GSM larval rearing. Their use for this purpose is intended in the near future. A provisional patent has been prepared and will be submitted shortly. It is anticipated that future work will continue with these probiotic strains to determine their potential benefit for other aquaculture species.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Greenshell mussels.</field><field name="subject">Probiotics.</field><field name="subject">Aquaculture.</field><field name="subject">New Zealand.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1036</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organisational implementation of storage area networks as a strategic knowledge managment tool.</field><field name="creator">Jamoo, George</field><field name="description">University of Technology, Sydney.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1101</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diversity and systematics of Peyssonneliaceae (Rhodophyta) from Vanuatu and southeastern Australia</field><field name="creator">Dixon, Kyatt R.</field><field name="description">The thesis investigates members of the crustose and largely calcified red algal family Peyssonneliaceae through molecular analyses and anatomical and ultrastructural observations.

However, it is unclear whether nutritional requirements differ between genotypes. A series of experiments compared young (4 - 12 months) red deer and red deer-elk cross (hybrids) in various aspects of their nutrition.  Single genotype groups (10-15) of red deer and hybrid weaner stags were offered one of four pasture allowances (2 to 12 kg DM/head/day) on a rotationally grazed mixed ryegrass - white clover pasture system for 9 weeks in winter (June-July), spring (October-December) and summer (February - March). Stags were weighed and given a new allocation of pasture weekly. Pre-grazing pasture mass ranged from 800 kg DM/ha for low pasture allowances to 4500kg DM/ha for higher allowances. Winter live-weight gain was low (40-80 g/day), relatively unaffected by pasture allowance and similar for both genotypes. In spring however, hybrids gained live-weight on average 100 g/day more than red deer across all pasture allowances and the response to additional pasture allowance was large (110 g/day at 2kg DM/head/day to 300 g/day at 9.5 kg DM/head/day). At the highest pasture allowance, hybrids grew faster (350 g/day) than red deer (250 g/day), although red deer were able to achieve this live-weight gain when offered less pasture (4 vs 12 kg DM/head/day, respectively). Summer live-weight gain was lower for both genotypes and responded less to increases in pasture allowance than during spring.  A second experiment compared the live-weight gain of both genotypes at ad lib feeding in an indoor environment where intake could be accurately measured. A group of red deer (n =15) and a group of hybrid (n =15) weaner stags were housed indoors during winter (3 June - 27 August) and spring (16 October - 16 December) and fed a pelleted grain based ration ad lib. Mean daily intake for each group (kg DM/head/day) was calculated as the difference between feed offered and feed refused. Hybrids had a significantly higher (P&lt; 0.05) absolute DM intake compared with red deer in both seasons, although when expressed on a metabolic body weight basis, there was no difference between genotypes irrespective of season. Live-weight gain during winter did not differ significantly between genotypes regardless of whether it was expressed on an absolute or metabolic weight basis. Spring live-weight gain, expressed both on an absolute and metabolic live-weight basis, was significantly higher for hybrids compared with red deer (P&lt;0.05). Red deer and hybrids increased their feed intake from winter to spring by 20% and 24% respectively on a metabolic body weight basis. Although the difference between genotypes in their seasonal increase in intake was relatively small there was a large difference in their pattern of live-weight gain. Red deer exhibited a 34% and hybrids a 76% seasonal increase in live-weight gain expressed on a metabolic live-weight basis from winter to spring. These results indicate the greater rate of live-weight gain displayed by hybrids compared with red deer was not associated with a greater ad lib intake (expressed on a metabolic body weight basis) and the seasonal increase in live-weight gain is greater for hybrids than for red deer.  A further experiment estimated the energy requirement for maintenance of both genotypes. Five deer of each genotype were housed in separate pens (3.5m&#178;) during winter (3 June - 27 August) and spring (16 October - 16 December) and randomly assigned to one of 5 feeding levels (0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, or 0.9 times estimated ad lib intake of l.5 and l.7 kg DM/head/day during the winter and 3.0 and 3.3 kg DM/head/day during the spring for red deer and hybrids, respectively. Maintenance requirement was determined by regression analysis of live-weight gain on ME intake. Although there was no seasonal effect on the live weight gain response to intake there was a significant genotype effect. To maintain live weight during either season, hybrids required a higher ME intake (0.52 MJ ME/W0.75/day compared with red deer 0.41 MJ ME/W0.75/day). The rate of increase in live weight gain to increasing intake declined as intake increased and more so for red deer than hybrids.  The final experiment in the series involved individually housed deer and aimed to more precisely determine differences in maintenance requirement and examine the difference in composition of gain between genotypes. In addition, in vivo apparent DM digestibility was measured in both genotypes.  Red deer (n=7) and hybrid weaner stags (n=7) were housed in individual pens for a period of 8 weeks in both winter (July - August) and spring (November - December) and offered one of 7 feeding levels which ranged from maintenance to ad lib. During each 8 week experimental period, live weight gain, apparent digestibility and feed intake were measured. Immediately prior to, and at the conclusion of each 8 week period body composition was estimated using computer-assisted topography (CT scan).  In winter, there was no significant difference in the live weight gain response to intake although red deer tended to have a higher (44 vs 55 MJ/kg) requirement for gain than hybrids. In spring, red deer had a lower requirement for maintenance (0.35 vs 0.47 MJ ME/W0.75/day) but a greater requirement for live weight gain (64 vs 35 MJ/kg) than hybrids. In spring, mean ad lib intake was about 30% higher than in winter and was greater for hybrids than for red deer. Energy retention in whole body (kJ/W0.75/day) did not differ between genotypes in either winter or spring but both the energy requirement for zero energy balance (0.59 vs 0.48 MJ ME/W0.75/day) and the efficiency of utilisation (0.37 vs 0.24) was greater in spring than in winter. The disparity between live weight gain and whole body weight gain may have been due to differences in gut fill.  There was no significant difference between genotypes in relative growth coefficients for lean, bone or adipose tissue in whole body. However hybrids tended to have a higher winter and lower spring growth coefficient for fat compared with red deer. Growth coefficients for adipose, lean and bone, respectively were 0.983, 1.063 and 1.026 for winter and 1.02, 0.708 and 1.727 for spring. At the same whole body weight, deer in October had less adipose tissue than in August. It is unclear whether this represents a strategy for rapid spring growth or is an artefact of experimental protocol.  Apparent dry matter digestibility (DMD) did not differ between genotypes but was higher by between 7 and 15 percentage units in winter compared with spring. Unexpectedly, digestibility was positively correlated with intake. Digestibility increased by 2.6 percentage units for every 10g DM/W0.75/day increase in either season in one group and 4.1 and 2.1 percentage units for deer in winter and spring respectively in another group. Errors in faecal collection were discounted as causes of the unexpected result.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">red deer</field><field name="subject">Cervus elaphus</field><field name="subject">elk</field><field name="subject">hybrid</field><field name="subject">nutrition</field><field name="subject">metabolism</field><field name="subject">liveweight gain</field><field name="subject">070204 - Animal Nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/2166</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Exploration of the Role of School Principals in Faith Formation Leadership Within the Educational Mission of Two Australian Anglican Schools</field><field name="creator">Moody, Craig William</field><field name="description">This study offers a response to the question facing the Australian Anglican Church about how the mission of Anglican schools is aligned with the mission of the whole Church. The study explores two Anglican school principals&#8217; faith formation leadership, as they engage in this mission. Fundamental to understanding the context of this study is awareness of Anglicanism&#8217;s broad variety of expression balanced with unity through Scripture, Reason and Tradition. In spite of differences, the Anglican Church seeks the &#8216;Via Media&#8217;, the middle way, held together in a dynamic tension of debate. Anglican school principals lead faith formation in this context of diversity, which leads to the purpose of this study: to explore two Australian Anglican school principals&#8217; perceptions of their role and capability as school leaders of faith formation within the Anglican Church&#8217;s mission. The three questions guiding this study relate to the ways in which the principals understand their role, their capability for the role, and the ways in which the Anglican Church has equipped them to be faith formation leaders in their schools. Various Anglican sources note that these questions have been on the Anglican Church&#8217;s agenda for several decades. A recent report on the governance relationship between an Australian Anglican Diocese and its schools noted lack of Anglican identity and role definition of schools&#8217; mission in the Church as significant issues (Nicholson, 2007), and this appears to be the case in faith formation leadership also. Underpinning this study are assumptions that the nurturing of the Christian faith in the Anglican tradition is a core task of Anglican schools as agents of Anglican mission, and that the principal of an Anglican school plays a key role in leading faith formation by authentic personal Christian witness. In this study, Anglican school faith formation leadership has been explored in cultural and symbolic dimensions of leadership. Catholic and Lutheran schools&#8217; faith formation leadership practices are reviewed to inform the study. This exploratory, qualitative study has an orientation of social constructionism, seeking two purposively sampled Australian Anglican school principals&#8223; perceptions from an open research stance. A theoretical framework of symbolic interactionsism has valued the participants&#8217; context. A phenomenological research methodology has used data gathering methods of interview, survey questionnaire, observation and documentary analysis. The study indicates that areas for further study include the shared faith formation leadership roles of principals and school chaplains; the fostering of a culture of research about Anglican school faith leadership; the provision of professional mentoring for principals; the relationship of principals to the Anglican Church; and provision by the Anglican Church of guiding statements and training to equip principals for their faith leadership roles.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anglican Church</field><field name="subject">Anglican school principals</field><field name="subject">Faith formation</field><field name="subject">Leadership</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp234.01072010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD.

Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The contested &#8220;White Lady&#8221;: Perceptions and social meanings of the &#8220;White Lady&#8221; in Auckland.</field><field name="creator">Neill, Lindsay John</field><field name="description">The White Lady (WL) is a mobile fast food takeaway eatery. The WL has been trading in Auckland City&#8217;s central business district for almost fifty years. The WL opens in the early evening and remains open until the early morning hours. At closing, the WL is towed to a storage area where it remains until this process is repeated. This daily pattern has occurred since the WL opened in 1948. Because of its longevity, the WL, and many of its stakeholders have experienced ongoing change as Auckland City has grown, and competition within fast food has increased. Thus, for many stakeholders, the WL is representative of their lives, a mirror of their reality and life experiences. Obviously, these realities and experiences are different for different stakeholders. In this thesis, I examine the contested &#8220;White Lady&#8221; (WL): the perceptions and the social meanings that its stakeholder groups attribute to it. This thesis illuminates differences and similarities within stakeholder viewpoints and in doing so defines that pie carts like the WL are a valid part of New Zealand&#8217;s culinary and social cultures Ultimately, this thesis provides a platform of knowledge from which stakeholders and others can come to understand and know the differing and similar views that other stakeholder groups hold. With this in mind, this research ranges in scope from the examination of city administration to the symbolism associated with the (WL) by some of its stakeholders. Therefore, this research is founded within socio-historic constructs: the history of fast food and, the similarities that this history holds to today&#8217;s WL operation. The contextualisation of hospitality within &#8220;three domains&#8221; (Lashley, 2004, p.13) aids in defining the WL as well as recognising the competitive growth of New Zealand&#8217;s fast food industry. This research suggests that fast food growth and subsequent competition have had negative impacts upon many small fast food outlets including the WL. viii The growth of fast food has facilitated a &#8220;slow food&#8221; (Jones, Shears, Hiller Comfort and Lowell, 2003, p. 298) movement. This movement coupled with the hierarchy of food typologies, adds a Saussurian overlay and sociological discourse to this work. This overlay clarifies for the reader Bourdieu&#8217;s (1984) position that all food is reflective of class status. Within postmodernist constructs and the rise of the individual, (and the consequent opportunity to hear &#8216;voices from the margins&#8217;), movement within class and individuality within New Zealand&#8217;s wider culture has occurred. Social change therefore, has facilitated some of the issues within WL contestation. In highlighting Bourdieu&#8217;s (1984) concept, the &#8220;binary opposition&#8221; (Levi-Strauss, 1981, as cited in Adamenko, 2007, p.27) inherent within food hierarchies and, as often expressed within the media, is examined. This examination reveals that while the media inform, this information often contributes to the polarisation of opinion that facilitates the formation of contested viewpoints by WL stakeholders. It is against a backdrop of compliance need, the absence of an official street trading policy, the differing views of stakeholders, and the intensification of competition in fast food, coupled with a lacuna in the knowledge base of younger Auckland residents regarding the WL that this research finds its voice.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fast food</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Contestation</field><field name="subject">Hospitality</field><field name="subject">Pie cart</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/818</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organisational prerequisites to fund, implement and sustain Maori health promotion in a primary care setting</field><field name="creator">Brown, Rachel</field><field name="description">M&#257;ori are the indigenous people of New Zealand. As a population group M&#257;ori have on average the poorest health status of any ethnic group in New Zealand (Ministry of Health, 2007). Much of this disproportionate ill-health is linked to manageable and/or preventable conditions. Given this, there is much scope for effective M&#257;ori health promotion in particular, as the M&#257;ori population is relatively young. The primary objective of the case study research was to determine the organisational pre-requisites necessary to fund, implement and sustain M&#257;ori health promotion within a primary care setting. Secondary aims were to; identify how health promotion is perceived within a &#8216;M&#257;ori&#8217; primary health care setting, identify existing health promotion practice, and test the feasibility of implementing a current M&#257;ori health promotion framework. The case study research was informed by 19 key informant interviews and two focus group sessions. A literature review including an organisational document review was also undertaken. Findings indicated that many of the pre-requisites necessary for effective M&#257;ori health promotion implementation sat outside the scope of the organisation and needed to come from a variety of sources including the Ministry of Health, District Health Board&#8217;s (DHB&#8217;s), community organisations and health providers, wh&#257;nau (family), hap&#363; (sub tribe) and iwi (tribe), including support from other sectors. The research also found a number of underlying issues that impacted greatly on the health of the M&#257;ori population within the PHO. These issues need to be addressed at a number of levels and given high New Zealand priority. In testing the feasibility of a current M&#257;ori health promotion model (Kia Uruuru Mai a Hauora) it was considered by participants to fit well with the goals, principles and values of the case study site and within primary health care in general, complementing critical health care service delivery components that already exist. The study&#8217;s conclusion found that there was much scope for M&#257;ori health promotion that was fully supported, recognised, and adequately and appropriately resourced by the New Zealand Government, Ministry of Health and DHB&#8217;s in order to provide long term cost effective and sustainable health benefits.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori health promotion</field><field name="subject">primary care</field><field name="subject">health promotion</field><field name="subject">health promotion models</field><field name="subject">Maori health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/938</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In the company of strangers: Negotiating the parameters of indeterminacy; A study of the roaming body and departure in urban spaces</field><field name="creator">Baker , Mike</field><field name="description">This performance-based project scrutinizes indeterminacy as a mediating force impinging upon our behaviour and its subsequent impact on the nature and constituency of engagements and dialogue between people in urban spaces. Concepts centering on the dynamics of departure are being investigated with focus upon the Multi User Virtual Environment (MUVE), Second Life as a facet of real life (the term 'real life' will henceforth be referred to in this document within the context of Second Life, as First Life). Experienced through the vehicle of the Roaming Body, our meetings and encounters with people and places frequently manifest as disjunct communiqu&#233;s and mis-engagements. I am asserting that this is due to the inevitability in our existence of indeterminacy acting as a significant factor in the articulation of our relations with others, reinforcing our description as time-based entities traversing the passage of the everyday. I maintain that this is frequently evidenced in our behaviours through the occurrence (notwithstanding arrivals) of a continual, pre-emptive state of departure. Indeterminacy implies motion and emerges, as Massumi asserts, through &#8216;&#8230; an unfolding relation to its own nonpresent potential to vary &#8230;&#8217;. We, as humans, are constantly being drawn away &#8211; always either approaching or embracing involuntarily, a 'state-of-Leaving&#8217; which co-mingles with and unerringly erodes our efforts to stay engaged with another in the here and now. In my dance and video practice, interventionist dance strategies are being used to prompt and interrogate the constituents of departure within encounters in designated public places. Experimental movement frameworks employed are informed by the discipline of Contact Improvisation Dance and Authentic Movement.

Shigella flexneri type 2a in particular is responsible for the majority of incidents in developing countries. The S. flexneri protease IcsP, is a member of the Omptin family of outer membrane (OM) proteases which cleaves IcsA, a polarly localised OM protein required for Shigella virulence. Mutations in icsP have been shown to effect the observed distribution of IcsA, however the significance of IcsP in Shigella virulence is incompletely understood. In this study, aspects of IcsP biology were investigated. S. flexneri 2457T and M90T icsP mutants were constructed to investigate the role of IcsP in Shigella intercellular spread, and it was found that icsP in both S. flexneri backgrounds did not appear to be essential for cell-tocell spread in human cervical cancer HeLa cells, but enhanced cell-to-cell spread in monkey kidney CV-1 cells (as determined by plaque assays). Complementation with icsP returned the mutant phenotype to wild-type. The results suggest IcsP does play a role in Shigella intercellular spread. The 2457T icsP mutant was subsequently complemented with an altered icsP gene encoding a haemagglutinin epitope tagged IcsP (IcsPHA) to determine the distribution of IcsP on the cell surface. In both S. flexneri and E. coli K-12 possessing smooth and rough lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the distribution of IcsPHA was found to be punctate across the cell surface. Deconvolution analysis revealed that IcsP distribution was punctate and banded in both LPS backgrounds. A smooth LPS E. coli K-12 yfdI mutant strain expressing IcsPHA was also constructed, and experiments involving treatment of this strain with bacteriophage Sf6 tail spike protein suggested that LPS O antigen chains masked IcsP in smooth LPS strains. During these studies, double-labelling of IcsPHA and LPS in a S. flexneri 5a M90T strain revealed a helical distribution of LPS in this strain. Overall, the results suggest IcsP has a punctate, banded distribution across the cell surface. The effect of virK and rmlD mutations on IcsP was then investigated by constructing a virK, rmlD and virK/rmlD double mutant in S. flexneri 2457T. Western immunoblotting showed no change in IcsP expression levels in either the virK, rmlD or virK/rmlD mutants compared to wild-type. Surprisingly, the virK mutant showed no change in IcsA expression levels by Western immunoblotting and plaque assays (using HeLa and CV-1 cells) suggested that virK was not essential for Shigella intercellular spread (contradicting the published data on this gene). No effect was also observed on IcsP expression level or on IcsP&#8217;s ability to cleave IcsA into culture supernatants. Finally alternative substrates for the protease activity of IcsP were investigated against known Omptin substrates (plasminogen, &#945;2-antiplasmin, complement, protamine and colicins). However, IcsP appeared to have no effect on these substrates as determined by proteolytic cleavage assays and antimicrobial assay. Interestingly, Plg cleavage by rough LPS S. flexneri, and &#945;2AP cleavage by both smooth and rough LPS S. flexneri, was observed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shigella flexneri; IcsP; Outer membrane; Protease</field><field name="subject">Shigella flexneri Molecular genetics.

The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of milk protein ingredients on physico-chemical properties of rice starch : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology at Massey University Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Noisuwan, Angkana</field><field name="description">The overall aim of this thesis is to determine if the interactions between normal and waxy rice starch and milk proteins from four milk protein ingredients, namely skim milk powder (SMP), milk protein concentrate (MPC), sodium caseinate (NaCAS) and whey protein isolate (WPI) do occur, and to identify the mechanisms underlying these interactions. Different milk protein ingredients at various concentrations (0 to 10%, w/w) affected markedly and differently the pasting behaviour of 10% (w/w) rice starches. SMP delayed the pasting of both rice starches by increasing the onset temperature (Tonset) and the peak viscosity temperature (Tpeak) of pasting. This was mainly due to the presence of lactose and ions, which was further supported by the investigation of the effects of UFSMP (a solution of salts and lactose present in SMP at their proper concentration) and lactose. The addition of NaCAS also delayed the pasting of rice starch; Tpeak in the case of both starches was increased. For normal rice starch paste, MPC and WPI decreased the Tpeak. MPC had no affect on Tpeak of waxy rice starch paste. The qualitative viscoelastic behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient gels obtained from the above pastes was dominated by the continuous phase made of the starch molecules. There was evidence, as indicated by confocal microscopy, of phase separation between the milk proteins of SMP and MPC and the two starches. The phase separation was not observed in the addition of either NaCAS or WPI. Studies on the thermal behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient mixtures by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that SMP, similarly to UFSMP, delayed the gelatinization of both starches. NaCAS also delayed the gelatinisation of both starches but had a greater effect on waxy than normal rice starch. The addition of NaCAS did not affect Tonset but increased Tpeak for normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinisation temperature of waxy rice starch was highly affected by the addition of NaCAS with both Tonset and Tpeak shifted to higher temperatures. MPC had no affect on the gelatinization temperature of normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinization temperature of waxy rice starch was increased by the addition of MPC. The addition of WPI to both rice starches showed two thermal transitions. The first of these was due to the gelatinisation of the starches and the second to the denaturation of &#223;-lactoglobulin (&#223;-lg). The addition of WPI to normal rice starch showed that the thermal behaviour of normal starch and protein were independent from each other. In contrast, the thermal behaviour of waxy rice starch was modified by the addition of WPI; both Tonset and Tpeak were increased. SMP decreased the Tonset of swelling, swelling ratio and the amount of starch leaching from both starches. These observed changes were due to the presence of lactose and ions in SMP. NaCAS slightly increased Tonset of swelling but the amount of starch leaching was reduced for both rice starches. The rigidity of both starches tended to increase in the presence of NaCAS. MPC and WPI affected the swelling behaviour of normal and waxy rice starch differently. A dramatic increase in the swelling of normal rice starch/MPC or WPI mixtures was observed, whereas this trend was not evident for waxy rice starch/ MPC or WPI mixtures. The difference in the water holding ability and gelatinization peak temperatures of the two starches over the temperature range at which whey proteins denature and form gels are believed to be responsible for the observed differences. The results from confocal microscopy showed that milk proteins, such as a-casein, &#223;- casein, &#223;-lg and a-lactalbumin (a-la), were adsorbed onto the granule surface of both normal and waxy rice starch. The mechanism for this adsorption is the hydrophilic interactions; hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl group from terminated glucan molecule that protrude around starch granule surface-hydroxyl; amino, or other electron-donation or electron-accepting groups of the added proteins. Using sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) it was found that for SMP and MPC the adsorbed as- to &#223;-casein ratio on both starches was similar to the as-casein to &#223;- casein ratio in the casein micelle at low SMP and MPC concentrations. But at high concentrations of SMP or MPC, this ratio decreased indicating that more &#223;-casein was adsorbed preferentially to as-casein. In the case of NaCAS, as-casein was adsorbed preferentially to &#223;-casein. Moreover, there was evidence of multilayer adsorption of ascasein into the surface of rice starch granules. Compared to the other milk protein ingredients, very small amounts of the &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI were adsorbed onto starch granules. However, the adsorbed amounts of &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI continuously increased with increasing WPI concentration, suggesting that these two proteins, particularly &#223;-lg, adsorbed in multilayers too.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">waxy rice starch</field><field name="subject">lactoglobulin</field><field name="subject">gelatinazation</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290104 Other food sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The tensions facing a board of trustee model within the cultural framework of kura kaupapa Maaori : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts in Social Policy at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stokes, Kanewa</field><field name="description">This study originated from personal experience, as a member of a Board of Trustee (BOT) within Kura Kaupapa Maaori (KKM). The workload required for Kura compliance with government regulation and legislation, was phenomenal. The BOT model seemed to be structured on a corporate model of governance with accountability to the Ministry of Education. This contradicted with the needs of Kura whaanau to be involved in Kura decisionmaking. The BOT model unintentionally created a separation and tension between whaanau and BOT members. This research set out to explore the BOT model of governance within our Kura, from a cultural perspective, rather, than researching problems identified by ERa. The research undertook a review of the literature that placed the BOT model within the 1984 -1990 Economic Reforms. It highlighted the impact of past government policies, and administration, on the Maaori language and culture to illuminate the cultural, economic, political and social context of the establishment of Kura Kaupapa Maaori and the doctrine of Te Aho Matua (TAM). The BOT model, and KKM/TAM, are founded on differing values. The study was approached from a Kaupapa Maaori perspective; not wishing to reaffirm the negative stigma of past research undertaken of Maaori. The objectives of the study were to gain an understanding of whaanau cultural capacity, perceptions and understanding of KKM and TAM; and also, whaanau understanding of the BOT model. The research design consisted of a case study. This involved a questionnaire to all whaanau; and in-depth discussions with a sample of twelve whaanau. Appropriate ethical considerations were given to the process, which addressed both academic and cultural needs. Findings clearly identify the structure, and nature of the BOT model, being problematic within the cultural framework of a KKM underpinned by Te Aho Matua. The values and principles between the model and TAM fundamentally conflict. Findings also identify key factors, that both government and Kura whaanau can utilise, in advancing whaanau governance.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kura kaupapa Maori</field><field name="subject">school administration</field><field name="subject">school boards</field><field name="subject">boards of trustees</field><field name="subject">ethnic schools</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rheo-NMR studies of macromolecules : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Physics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kakubayashi, Motoko</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the effects of simple shear flow on macromolecular structure and interactions are investigated in detail via a combination of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and rheology, namely Rheo-NMR. A specially designed NMR couette shear cell and benchtop shear cell, developed in-house, demonstrated that the direct measurement of the above phenomena is possible. First, to determine whether the shear cells were creating simple shear flow, results were reproduced from literature studies of liquid crystal systems which report shear effects on: Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) in deuterium oxide, and Poly(gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PBLG) in m-cresol. Next, the possible conformational changes to protein structure brought about by shear were investigated by applying shear to Bovine  -lactogobulin ( -Lg). As the protein was sheared, a small, irreversible conformational change was observed by means of one-dimensional and two-dimensional 1H NMR with reasonable reproducibility. However, no observable change was detected by means of light scattering. A large conformational change was observed after shearing a destabilized  -Lg sample containing 10% Trifluoroethanol (TFE) (v/v). From an NMR point of view, the sheared state was similar to the structure of  -Lg containing large amounts of  -helices and, interestingly, similar to the structure of  -Lg containing  -sheet amyloid fibrils. Gel electrophoresis tests suggested that the changes were caused by hydrophobic interactions. Unfortunately, this proved to be difficult to reproduce. The effect of shear on an inter-macromolecular interaction was investigated by applying shear during an enzyme reaction of pectin methylesterase (PME) on pectin. Experimental method and analysis developments are described in detail. It was observed that under the conditions studied, shear does not interfere with the de-esterification of pectin with two types of PME, which have different action mechanisms at average shear rates up to 1570 s-1.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">macromolecular structure</field><field name="subject">shear</field><field name="subject">pectin</field><field name="subject">protein interactions</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240300 Atomic and Molecular Physics; Nuclear and Particle Physics, Plasma Physics::240301 Atomic and molecular physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accelerating classifier training using AdaBoost within cascades of boosted ensembles : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Sciences at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Susnjak, Teo</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to address current problems encountered when training classifiers within the framework of cascades of boosted ensembles (CoBE). At present, a signifi- cant challenge facing this framework are inordinate classifier training runtimes. In some cases, it can take days or weeks (Viola and Jones, 2004; Verschae et al., 2008) to train a classifier. The protracted training runtimes are an obstacle to the wider use of this framework (Brubaker et al., 2006). They also hinder the process of producing effective object detection applications and make the testing of new theories and algorithms, as well as verifications of others research, a considerable challenge (McCane and Novins, 2003). An additional shortcoming of the CoBE framework is its limited ability to train clas- sifiers incrementally. Presently, the most reliable method of integrating new dataset in- formation into an existing classifier, is to re-train a classifier from beginning using the combined new and old datasets. This process is inefficient. It lacks scalability and dis- cards valuable information learned in previous training. To deal with these challenges, this thesis extends on the research by Barczak et al. (2008), and presents alternative CoBE frameworks for training classifiers. The alterna- tive frameworks reduce training runtimes by an order of magnitude over common CoBE frameworks and introduce additional tractability to the process. They achieve this, while preserving the generalization ability of their classifiers. This research also introduces a new framework for incrementally training CoBE clas- sifiers and shows how this can be done without re-training classifiers from beginning. However, the incremental framework for CoBEs has some limitations. Although it is able to improve the positive detection rates of existing classifiers, currently it is unable to lower their false detection rates.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CoBE framework</field><field name="subject">classifiers</field><field name="subject">classification algorithms</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280212 Neural networks, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The physiological effects of pseudoephedrine on endurance cycling : a thesis submitted in the partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Sport and Exercise Science, Massey University (Palmerston North, New Zealand)</field><field name="creator">Mouatt, Joshua Roger</field><field name="description">Background: Pseudoephedrine (PSE) is a mild central nervous system stimulant that when consumed at a high dosage has the potential to alter physiological and psychophysical responses. PSE is widely accessible as over-the-counter medication and despite limited research into PSE at high dosages or its effects on prolonged exercise (&gt;2 hours) is no-longer on the World Anti-Doping Association&#8217;s banned substance list. Currently unrestricted in sport and with no real understanding of the abovementioned responses during endurance exercise there is a high potential for abuse in sport. A recent study performed in our laboratory found PSE to improve self-paced cycling performance in some individuals, however no physiological measurements were taken Purpose: The primary purpose of this study was to determine the physiological effects of PSE at a dosage previously shown to improve performance (2.5 mg/kg) in some individuals during prolonged cycling. A secondary purpose of this study was to assess the effect on endurance cycling performance. Methods: In a randomized, double-blind and counter-balanced design, ten welltrained cyclists participated in two trials, consisting of 120 min of fixed-intensity cycling at 65% VO2max followed by a set work, self-paced time-trial (TT) of ~30 min, following ingestion of either 2.5 mg/kg PSE or visual-matched glucose placebo. Venous blood samples were collected before and during exercise, along with body temperatures and heart rate. Perceived effort and expired gas samples were collected during exercise. Exercise and diet was controlled ~48-hours prior to the trials. Results: Mean heart rate was significantly higher with PSE (P = 0.028) during fixed-intensity exercise. Blood glucose concentrations were significantly lower with PSE (P &lt;0.001) for the first 40 min of fixed-intensity exercise. Respiratory exchange ratio was lower in the final 20-min of fixed-intensity and TT with PSE. Blood lactate, perceived effort, ventilation, and body temperatures were not significantly different between conditions during exercise, nor was TT performance; however individual response was variable. Conclusions: PSE ingestion increased heart rate during endurance cycling and initially suppressed carbohydrate release into the bloodstream while increasing fat oxidation in the later stages of exercise. Despite individual responses, endurance cycling performance remained unchanged with PSE ingestion.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cycling performance</field><field name="subject">physiological measurements</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321400 Human Movement and Sports Science::321401 Exercise physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1013</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality assessment and ethnicity : a New Zealand study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand.

To date there has only been two published studies that have used New Zealand relevant ethnic groups when analysing whether personality measures used in pre-employment settings exhibit different mean scores. The present thesis performed a systematic evaluation on the impact of ethnicity on personality traits. The study examined the impact of ethnicity on NZ Army Officer applicant personality assessment scores measured by the EPQ-R and GPP-I. Four ethnic groups (NZ Europeans, M&#226;ori, Pasifika, and Asian) were analysed for mean trait score differences among ethnic groups, the stability of these differences across different personality inventories and models, the variance of personality traits, the impact of ethnicity on age and gender relationships with personality traits, and how these differences were related to employment selection outcomes. The analyses revealed that ethnicity did have some impact on mean personality assessment scores used in the study. However, these were mostly small differences among ethnic groups. In addition, most of these differences found on the EPQ-R and the GPP-I were not consistent across inventories and models. There were no significant variance differences found on personality traits among ethnic groups. While initial analysis suggested that ethnicity did not influence the relationship between age and gender on personality assessment, further examination suggested that the relationship between gender and personality was impacted on by ethnicity. There were reassuring results found for New Zealand psychologists and HR specialists, as only two of the twelve traits analysed showed moderate differences on traits that were related to selection outcomes. However, for the NZ Army OSB selection process the findings in the present study indicate that the Lie scale on the EPQ-R and the Vigor trait on the GPP-I may need to be interpreted with caution for Asian and Pasifika groups. These results are discussed in terms of implications for personality theory, measurement, and the direction of future research.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personality assessment</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised</field><field name="subject">EPQ-R</field><field name="subject">Gordon Personal Profile - Inventory</field><field name="subject">GPP-I</field><field name="subject">ethnic status</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1188</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reflecting diversity or selecting viewpoints : an analysis of the GM debate in New Zealand's media 1998-2002 : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of PhD in Communication at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ashwell, Douglas James</field><field name="description">The advent of genetically modified (GM) food in New Zealand in 1998 saw the beginning of a highly politicised debate about GM use in the country. The concern over GM and the political situation after the 1999 general election saw the Government establish a Royal Commission of Inquiry on Genetic Modification in May, 2000. The Royal Commission and strong public opposition to GM, evident in large public protests and other actions, made the issue highly newsworthy. The aim of this study was to explore how newspapers reported the GM debate, in particular, examining whether the reportage facilitated greater public debate and awareness about GM through journalists adhering to the ideals of the theory of social responsibility and enacting their watchdog role as encapsulated in the Fourth Estate tradition of the media. To achieve these aims the overall tone of the reportage and also which news source types and themes were most frequently reported were examined. In addition, the relationship and perceptions of scientists and journalists involved in the reporting were explored to examine how these relationships may have influenced the reportage. Content analysis showed the reportage had a pro-GM bias with policy-makers, scientists and industry spokespeople the most frequently cited news sources. The themes of Science, Economics and Politics dominated the reportage. Other source types and themes were less represented, especially themes dealing with ethical and environmental arguments. This lack of representation occurred despite the Royal Commission offering a space for all interested parties to speak. The interviews illustrated that scientists believed the quality of newspaper coverage of GM lacked depth and that important issues were unreported. Journalists found the issue complex to report and said they took care not to oversimplify the science and issues surrounding GM. The relationship between scientists and journalists indicated particular tensions existing between the two groups. The thesis concludes that if robust public debate is to occur within New Zealand regarding GM and other scientific developments, then the media should reflect a greater diversity of opinion by citing other potential news sources offering alternative arguments based on, for example, ethical or environmental grounds.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">journalism viewpoints</field><field name="subject">newspaper report evaluation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::289900 Other Information, Computing and Communication Sciences ::289999 Other information, computing and communication sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A case study of the implementation of middle schooling in New Zealand : a thesis submitted in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Education at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Brown, Margaret Anne</field><field name="description">This thesis considers the introduction of middle schooling to the New Zealand education system. It is a case study of a school going through the process of introducing the middle schooling concept. It seeks to identify and explain the considerable challenges that this school faced as it sought to implement this change. This research project began as a study of the factors which hinder and support the implementation of middle schooling structures and practices. It became an analysis of the features of middle schooling that make it such a challenging and problematic innovation. Middle schooling is a set of philosophical concepts, educational practices and structural arrangements for the education of students between the ages of approximately ten and fourteen years. These concepts and practices are based on the premise that students of this age have academic, social, emotional and physical needs which differ from students on either side of this age group. Middle schooling is generally understood to involve integrated curriculum which is delivered through team teaching. This approach to teaching and learning requires high levels of teacher collaboration, flexible workspaces and timetables and high levels of parental support and involvement. Ideally, middle schooling provides a separate school environment for children of this age. A number of school communities in New Zealand have gained government approval to restructure as middle schools and are at various stages in implementing this new form of schooling. The researcher began the study with the intention of developing guidelines to assist school communities to make this transition from the structures and processes of conventional schooling arrangements to those of middle schooling. To this end she initiated a programme of action research in a school that was about to introduce middle schooling arrangements for its middle years students. The innovation began to run into difficulties from an early stage and it became clear that an action research methodology was unsustainable. Instead, the researcher chose to refocus the research problem to a more analytic study of the factors that were impeding the implementation process. The research methodology evolved to that of case study. Observational data were collected in the school over two years. From these data, three factors seemed to be affecting the implementation of the middle schooling changes. These were the way in which leadership was being executed, the attitudes and responses of the teachers and the particularly complex and demanding nature of the middle schooling innovation itself. The data were then re-analysed with respect to these three factors. From this analysis, the researcher came to a number of conclusions about the relative importance and impact of these three factors. In an effort to ascertain whether the experiences of the case school were typical of the difficulties and challenges schools face when implementing middle schooling change, the case findings were cross checked against the experiences of two other schools that were five years or more into the change process. The cross checking found that the experiences of these other schools were very similar to those of the case school. All three found that implementing middle schooling change had been more difficult and demanding than any other innovation they had implemented. This study identified some aspects of leadership and teacher behaviour that may have slowed the implementation process, but these seem to have been secondary to the sheer complexity and challenges involved with this particular form of innovation. An innovation that requires such a shift in values, behaviour, structures and systems from a school community, and one that requires the sustained commitment of the entire staff over an extended period of time, will always prove to be exceptionally challenging. The case study identified five requirements that middle school implementers need to consider in order to implement the concept successfully. Failure to consider any of these requirements is likely to threaten the success of the innovation. The five requirements are: &#8226; The need to develop a shared understanding of the concept rationale and principles and how these will be operationalised within the school; &#8226; The need to develop a shared understanding of the complex, multi-faceted and integrated nature of the innovation and how this will impact on and influence the implementation process; &#8226; The need for strong, visionary, shared leadership; &#8226; The need to gain the interest and operational commitment of the entire staff and a high level of interest and commitment from the parent community and to sustain this for the life of the innovation; and &#8226; The need to develop supportive and appropriate infrastructure within the school to support the innovation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Middle school education</field><field name="subject">Middle schooling</field><field name="subject">Intermediate schools</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A systematic search for the global minimum structures of Cs, Sn and Au clusters and corresponding electronic properties : a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Assadollahzadeh, Behnam</field><field name="description">Clusters of atoms or molecules form the building blocks of nanoscience and are regarded as a new type of material, as they constitute a bridge between microscopic and macroscopic forms of matter. The experimental and quantum theoretical study of structures, chemical and physical properties and reactivities of nanoclusters represents an innovative and very active field of research, which has resulted in a wide range of applications. Independent of the model used to describe the bonding in these clusters, one of the prime objectives is to find the geometrical arrangement of the atoms or molecules, for a given cluster size, which corresponds to the lowest energy on the potential energy hyper-surface, the global minimum. In order to find such an arrangement, a density functional theory based genetic algorithm code, which is rooted in the Darwinian evolution concept of the survival of the fittest, is developed and utilized to systematically search for the global minimum isomers of homo-nuclear clusters consisting of up to twenty atoms of cesium, tin, gold and of nine atoms of copper. The performance of this algorithm is excellent as numerous energetically lower-lying cluster isomers (compared to those reported in the literature) are found. Extensive valence basis sets together with energy-consistent scalar-relativistic pseudopotentials are employed to optimize the geometry of these clusters and to calculate their electronic properties accurately at the density functional level of theory. Moreover, in collaboration with the Technische Universit??t Darmstadt, the mean static polarizability of tin clusters are measured by a beam deflection method. The qualitative agreement between measured and calculated dipole moments and static electric dipole polarizabilities of tin clusters up to twenty atoms is satisfactory, thus confirming the accuracy of the theoretical models used in this work. Furthermore, the performance of density functional theory in the field of metallophilicity is investigated for dimeric and trimeric [X-M-PH3] compounds (X = Cl, Br, I; M = Cu, Ag, Au) and it is found that the metallophilicity decreases down the group 11 elements of the periodic table of elements.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nanoparticles</field><field name="subject">Metal clusters</field><field name="subject">Cesium</field><field name="subject">Tin</field><field name="subject">Copper</field><field name="subject">Gold</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250100 Physical Chemistry (Incl.

This study explores the interrelated areas of e-learning technology and pedagogy within the context of a postgraduate special education and educational psychology programme. The study is framed in a scholarship of teaching and learning approach and covers three successive phases of overlapping activities of teaching, learning and research. The first phase of the research focuses on the design of a community of practice approach to e-learning. The aim is to enable students to develop their identity as members of the professional community by bridging the gap between university-based learning and its real-world application. In the second phase of the research, alternative technology is used to investigate a better alignment of e-learning technology and pedagogy. The findings here show that a community of practice pedagogy is better aligned with a social constructionist e-learning technology. In the third phase of the research an e-learning alignment guide is developed to analyse the changes in e-learning in relation to the interrelated areas of technology, pedagogy and context. The guide is applied to the e-learning case studies in Phases 1 and 2 of this study. The profiles of alignment from these case studies illustrate the complexities and tensions in e-learning and the potential of linking advanced technologies with effective teaching practices to change the way we teach and learn. The key finding of this study is that careful alignment of technology, pedagogy and context is needed to actualise the potential of e-learning in higher education. The e-learning alignment guide developed in this study enables analysis of e-learning environments to provide alignment profiles. Aligning innovative technologies with appropriate pedagogies in different contexts is essential for e-learning to meet the needs of learners in the digital age. The enormous and rapid development of new educational technologies has seriously challenged traditional forms of pedagogy. This study shows that both a scholarship of teaching and learning approach and the use of the e-learning alignment guide can make a positive contribution to designing effective e-learning environments.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tertiary education</field><field name="subject">Distance education</field><field name="subject">Extramural education</field><field name="subject">Higher education</field><field name="subject">Computer-assisted instruction</field><field name="subject">Educational psychology</field><field name="subject">Special education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330107 Educational technology and media</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1403</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An operational framework for improving decentralised agricultural extension : a Ghanaian case study : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Ph. D.) in Agricultural Extension, Massey University, Institute of Natural Resources, Agricultural/Horticultural Systems &amp; Management</field><field name="creator">Okorley, Ernest</field><field name="description">The pressure on the public agricultural extension organisation in Ghana to improve its responsiveness to meet the needs of farmers has increased since the globalisation of trade in the early 1990s. To improve agricultural productivity and the livelihood security of farm households, the Ministry of Food and Agriculture in Ghana decentralised its extension service in 1997. Although this was a critical change in agricultural policy, the extension service has struggled to implement this policy effectively. Further improvement in the situation is hampered because there has been little research published in this area. To provide this understanding, a single-case study of a successful decentralised district level extension organisation in Ghana was used to identify the factors, processes and outcomes that contribute to its performance. The case organisation is an example of a district agricultural extension organisation that operates under a decentralisation system at the level of deconcentration, with a high farmer-to-extension agent ratio and limited and uncertain levels of Government funding. The results of the study emphasised the importance of the effects of both external and internal (or organisational) factors on the performance of the case organisation. The external factors included: (1) the political will to decentralise, (2) the level of decentralisation of other government departments, (3) the provision of a clear legal framework for decentralisation and (4) the existence of established institutions that are willing to support the decentralisation process. New external factors that were identified in this study were (1) the type and drivers of decentralisation, (2) stakeholders' willingness and commitment to support the decentralisation process and (3) the community characteristics in terms of land tenure arrangements and gender roles. The results confirmed the importance of the organisational factors prescribed in the literature: (1) stakeholder participation, (2) managerial and technical capacity, (3) operational funding and (4) accountability. However, the study also identified five other interrelated organisational factors that influenced the success of the case organisation that had not been previously reported in the literature. These included the needs to: (1) develop a needs-based extension programme, (2) expand the extension service focus and roles, (3) foster a cross-sector pluralistic extension approach (4) use needs-based groups for service delivery, and (5) extension staff attitudinal change. Multistakeholder (farmer and other organisations) participation was critical for the development of a needs-based extension programme. The case organisation had modified the traditional extension programme planning process to involve stakeholders at different levels of participation. Similarly, the case organisation involved stakeholders in its multilevel monitoring and evaluation processes. Stakeholder participation in planning and evaluation, although aimed ultimately at efficient and effective programme implementation and improvement, did enhance accountability. Because the case organisation had taken on a broader livelihood security focus to extension, the definition of farmer needs was extended to encompass on-farm and off-farm needs that have impact on the contribution agriculture makes to the livelihood security of farm households in the district. This broader livelihood security focus to extension required the case organisation to take on additional roles from those it traditionally held. In the study, a typology of such roles was developed and a role selection process used by the case organisation during its programme planning process was described. Similarly, because of this broader focus, the case organisation had to work both across sectors and with other extension providers from within the sector to meet the needs of farmers. Again, the multistakeholder programme planning process was central to fostering coordination and collaboration amongst the various extension providers in the district. Decentralisation has placed greater managerial responsibility on management staff of the case organisation. In addition, the livelihood security focus has required technical staff and attitudinal changes to develop and seek for a much broader range of skills and knowledge - meaning that the development of both managerial and technical capacity was important for the case organisation. Needs-based training, the development of a learning environment and the enhancement of staff motivation were critical for the development of staff capacity. As with other extension organisations in developing countries, the funding for the case organisation was limited and uncertain. To overcome these constraints, the case organisation had in place mechanisms to ensure its resources were used efficiently and that it could mobilise additional resources from outside the organisation. Resource efficiency was improved through an intensive monitoring system and the use of stable needs-based groups. Additional resources were mobilised by lobbying government and international donors for funds for projects that would meet the needs of farmers. Further resources were obtained through collaboration with other stakeholder organisations. Again, the multistakeholder planning process provided a platform for collaboration. Networking and special issue forums also provided mechanisms for enhancing collaboration within the district. Decentralisation was introduced into Ghana in 1997 with the aim of eventually developing a demand-driven extension system. Although viewed as successful, the case organisation has yet to achieve the level of farmer participation (i.e. self-mobilisation) that is required for a demand-driven extension system. Currently, after six years of decentralisation, the level of farmer participation can be classified as somewhere between consultation and collaboration. Therefore, the results of this study suggest that the transition from a top-down to a demand-driven extension system will take considerable time and resources.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Agricultural extension work</field><field name="subject">Agriculture and state</field><field name="subject">Ghana</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300900 Land, Parks and Agriculture Management::300901 Farm management, rural management and agribusiness</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1404</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental effects of densely planted willow and poplar in a silvopastoral system : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.

The nitrogen and phosphorus input in fertilisers coupled with livestock excreta and soil disturbance impose a serious threat to downstream water quality. The planting of trees is one option used to decrease soil erosion, increase the quantity of forage and manage runoff. To date, research has mainly focused on wide spaced poplar trees for feed quality and their effects on understorey pasture growth. However, there is increasing interest in the use of densely planted willow and poplar for fodder purpose. The effects of young (&lt; 5 yrs old) willow and poplar planted at close spacing on runoff, soil erosion, growth of understory pasture and nutrient losses have never been studied in New Zealand. Three field trials (two at Crop and Research Unit, Moginie, Manawatu and one at Riverside Farm, Masterton) were conducted between October 2004 and November 2006 that incorporated comparative establishment and growth of densely planted willow and poplar and their effects on soil moisture, runoff, sediment load and nutrient losses from grazed and fertilised farmland. It was concluded that densely planted willow and poplar (3-4 yrs) reduced total nitrogen (TN) and dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) by 47 % each and sediment load by 52 %. Young trees reduced surface runoff and soil moisture more as they aged. However, due to their deciduous nature willow and poplar were not effective in reducing surface runoff in winter and early spring. Sheep preferred camping under trees, especially in late spring and summer, and this led to greater deposition of dung and urine under trees than open pasture. Sheep grazing, especially in winter, significantly increased sediment and nutrient loads in runoff water. The N and P fertiliser application increased nutrient load in runoff water well above the threshold level required to initiate algal growth to create eutrophication. Densely planted willow and poplar significantly reduced understorey pasture growth by 23 % and 9 %, respectively, in their second year at Moginie, mainly due to shade, but coupled with soil moisture deficit in summer. The pasture growth in a willow browse block was 52 % of that in open pasture as a result of shade and differences in pasture species composition. Sheep browsing reduced willow leaf area significantly. Willow and poplar survival rates were similar (P &gt; 0.05) after two years of establishment (100 % vs 90.5 %, respectively). However, willow grew faster than poplar in height (1.90 vs 1.35 m), stem diameter (43.5 vs 32.6 mm), canopy diameter (69 vs 34 cm) and number of shoots (8.7 vs 2.3) at the age of two years, respectively. The research clearly demonstrated that densely planted young willow and poplar trees can reduce runoff, sediment load and nutrient losses from farmland to freshwater, but shade and soil moisture can limit pasture growth under trees. It is recommended that willow and poplar should be planted at wide spacing on the whole farm to minimise loss of pasture. Where blocks of trees are necessary, such as willow browse blocks, sheep browsing can be used as a tool to reduce shade to improve pasture growth. Livestock access to riparian strips should be minimal to avoid livestock camping that can have deleterious effects on water quality.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Agroforestry</field><field name="subject">Poplar</field><field name="subject">Willow</field><field name="subject">Fodder trees</field><field name="subject">Soil conservation</field><field name="subject">Hill farming</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300600 Forestry Sciences::300606 Agroforestry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1405</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Higher education quality assurance policy and practice in the Maldives : a case study from a small developing nation : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Education at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Maniku, Ahmed Ali</field><field name="description">This thesis comprises a case study of quality assurance policy and practice in the emerging higher education sector of the Maldives. The policy analysis is extended to incorporate a glonacal perspective, allowing analysis of quality assurance policy issues from the global, national and local contexts. In order to illuminate the analysis in the Maldives' primary case study, two secondary less intensive case studies are presented of quality assurance processes from a New Zealand polytechnic and the University of the South Pacific. Documentary evidence and semi-structured interviews from Key Informants form the main evidence base for the study. Data analysis is facilitated using NVivo. The thesis argues that the upsurge in quality assurance in higher education is primarily legitimated within a neoliberal discourse, Urged by transnational organisations such as the World Bank, there is widespread policy convergence in quality assurance. Whilst neoliberalism has had partial effects in the case of the Maldives, the study reveals that neoliberal ideology and the associated strategies of marketisation, privatisation, human resource development and managerialism have shaped quality assurance policy processes in varying degrees in the three cases. Findings in this study contribute to a fuller understanding of quality assurance policy processes in a small developing nation context: a perspective largely missing from current debates on the subject. The findings confirm that a combination of global, national and institutional factors influenced quality assurance policy processes in the Maldives. From the global context, globalisation and internationalisation of higher education trends affect quality assurance policy. At the national level, the desire for higher quality education found expression in the state's reassertion of its role in protecting public interest in regulating the sector through formal quality assurance. The social demand for international comparability has also lead to a growing trend of transnational quality assurance practices. The creation of the Maldives College of Higher Education was shown to be the principal impetus in quality assurance development. This national college played a lead role in developing a quality assurance model that tends to promote a regulatory compliance to quality. The study argues for a more inclusive model that acknowledges external compliance but also seeks to assure quality of teaching and learning leading to improved student outcomes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tertiary education</field><field name="subject">Higher education</field><field name="subject">Quality assurance policy</field><field name="subject">Maldives</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1406</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The human myostatin precursor protein : structure, function and amyloid formation : implications for the muscle wastage disease sporadic inclusion body myositis : a dissertation presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Biochemistry at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Starck, Carlene Sheree</field><field name="description">Myostatin is a major player in the regulation of mammalian muscle growth and development, maintaining the balance between proliferation and differentiation prenatally and the quiescence of satellite cells in adults. An absence or overexpression of myostatin results in double-muscling and cachexia respectively, placing myostatin as a promising target in the treatment of muscle wastage diseases. As a transforming growth factor-&#946; superfamily member, myostatin is produced as a precursor protein, consisting of a propeptide region N-terminal to the growth factor domain. Cleavage of the precursor between the domains forms the myostatin latent complex, an inhibitory structure which is exported from the cell where a second cleavage event releases the active myostatin growth factor. The precursor protein, propeptide, and latent complex play important roles in the regulation of myostatin. However, their structure and function are poorly understood, and a possible role for the myostatin precursor protein in the muscle wastage disease sporadic inclusion body myositis, suggests that pre-growth factor forms of myostatin may be additional important therapeutic targets. This thesis presents an investigation into the structure and function of the myostatin precursor protein, the latent complex, and the propeptide region within these, with comparisons to a mutant form of myostatin responsible for the naturally-occurring double-muscled phenotype of the Piedmontese cattle breed. Results suggest that the diverse functions of the propeptide region are facilitated by regions of intrinsic disorder within a primarily structured domain, and that conformational alterations accompany the precursor to latent complex transition, resulting in a tighter inhibitory structure. Comparative analyses between the wild-type and mutant proteins suggest that the Piedmontese phenotype is due to a reduced capacity for covalent dimerisation and significant structural alterations within the type I receptor-binding domain. Investigation into misfolded myostatin precursor protein found that the precursor is able to form cytotoxic amyloid aggregates and mature fibrils under partially denaturing conditions, suggesting a possible mechanism for the role of the myostatin precursor in sporadic inclusion body myositis. Together, these novel results contribute important information towards an understanding of myostatin structure, function and regulation in both normal and disease scenarios.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Myostatin precursor protein</field><field name="subject">Muscle wastage disease</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1408</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metal accumulation in toadfish, tetractenos glaber, and their prey items</field><field name="creator">Alquezar, Ralph</field><field name="description">Estuaries support productive and diverse ecosystems, based on the abundant food and diverse habitats. However with increasing human pressures, many estuaries along the coastline of Australia have become degraded. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the effects of estuarine metal contaminants on the physiology, and the subsequent accumulation, in the smooth toadfish, Tetractenos glaber, and their prey items in estuaries in the Sydney region, south eastern Australia. Toadfish and sediments were collected during three seasonal sampling periods (June 2002, September 2002 and January 2003) in four estuaries in the Sydney region (Port Hacking River, Cowan Creek, Parramatta River and Lake Macquarie). Sediment and toadfish tissue metal concentrations varied both spatially and temporally, with highest concentrations exhibited in the metal contaminated estuaries (Lake Macquarie and Parramatta River) during spring 2002 and summer 2003. Toadfish accumulated metals in different tissue, however field experiments were limited in determining the main pathways of accumulation. Controlled laboratory kinetic experiments using radioisotopes of 109Cd and 75Se, indicated that differences in the relative contributions of water and food in the accumulation of these metals are generally governed by the physiology of the toadfish and the type of prey eaten. The distribution of metals in fish organs is important for better understanding metal kinetics and their subsequent toxicity. Toadfish exposed to 109Cd in both water or food showed a shift in distribution from gut lining at the end of the uptake phase to the excretory organs, such as liver, by the end of the loss phase, suggesting that the main uptake pathway for water exposure was via the gut and not the gills, due to fish drinking large amounts of water to maintain osmoregulation. There was no appreciable shift in the distribution of 75Se from the uptake or loss phases, being mostly associated with the excretory organs (gills, liver and kidneys). Further investigation into the accumulation of metals in toadfish prey items revealed that differences in uptake and loss of 109Cd and 75Se were influenced by their aqueous speciation, as well as differences in animal physiology, sequestration, storage and excitation mechanisms. The uptake rates and CFs of 109Cd and 75Se were highest, and the biological half-lives the longest, in pygmy mussels, ghost shrimps and polychaetes relative to the semaphore and soldier crabs. Elevated metal concentrations in certain toadfish tissues from the four estuaries were linked to reduced lipid concentrations and increased protein concentrations, which may be detrimental for growth, reproductive output and survivorship of the fish. A closer investigation into the nutritional value and metal concentrations of toadfish prey items in a selected metal contaminated estuary (Parramatta River) revealed that toadfish from the more contaminated sites within the estuary may grow faster due to higher nutritional value of prey items on a local scale, however on a larger spatial scale, this was not evident. Further investigation is required to determine whether larger toadfish size can be attributed to physiological acclimation or genetic resistance through generations of continuous metal exposure. Many studies have assessed metal concentrations in water, sediments and biota in the field, however few studies have combined both field and laboratory experiments to examine the effects of metals on fish physiology and reproduction, and metal transfer pathways in aquatic biota. This study has contributed to a better understanding of metal accumulation and its physiological effects in estuarine biota and highlights the high spatial and temporal variability in responses of organisms to environmental metal pollution.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heavy metals.</field><field name="subject">Estuarine biology.</field><field name="subject">Toadfishes.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1103</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Responsive Workflows: Design, Execution and Analysis of Interruption Policy Models</field><field name="creator">Belinda Melanie Carter</field><field name="description">Business processes form the backbone of all business operations, and workflow technology has enabled companies to gain significant productivity benefits through the automatic enactment of routine, repetitive processes. Process automation can be achieved by encoding the business rules and procedures into the applications, but capturing the process logic in a graphical workflow model allows the process to be specified, validated and ultimately maintained by business analysts with limited technical knowledge. The process models can also be automatically verified at design-time to detect structural issues such as deadlock and ensure correct data flow during process execution. These benefits have resulted in the success of workflow technology in a variety of industries, although workflows are often criticised for being too rigid, particularly in light of their recent deployment in collaborative applications such as e-business. Generally, many events can impact on the execution of a workflow process. Initially, the workflow is triggered by an external event (for example, receipt of an order). Participants then interact with the workflow system through the worklist as they perform constituent tasks of the workflow, driving the progression of each process instance through the model until its completion. For traditional workflow processes, this functionality was sufficient. However, new generation 'responsive' workflow technology must facilitate interaction with the external environment during workflow execution. For example, during the execution of an 'order to cash' process, the customer may attempt to cancel the order or update the shipping address. We call these events 'interruptions'. The potential occurrence of interruptions can be anticipated but, unlike the other workflow events, they are never required to occur in order to successfully execute any process instance. Interruptions can also occur at any stage during process execution, and may therefore be considered as 'expected, asynchronous exceptions' during the execution of workflow processes. Every interruption must be handled, and the desired reaction often depends on the situation. For example, an address update may not be permitted after a certain point, where this point depends on the customer type, and a shipping charge or refund may be applicable, depending on the original and new delivery region. Therefore, a set of rules is associated with each interruption, such that if a condition is satisfied when the event occurs, a particular action is to be performed. This set of rules forms a policy to handle each interruption. Several workflow systems do facilitate the automatic enforcement of 'exception handling' rules and support the reuse of code fragments to enable the limited specification and maintenance of rules by non-technical users. However, this functionality is not represented in a formal, intuitive model. Moreover, we argue that inadequate consideration is given to the verification of the rules, with insufficient support provided for the detection of issues at design-time that could hinder effective maintenance of the process logic or interfere with the interruption handling functionality at run-time. This thesis presents a framework to capture, analyse and enforce interruption process logic for highly responsive processes without compromising the benefits of workflow technology. We address these issues in two stages. In the first stage, we consider that the reaction to an interruption event is dependent on three factors: the progress of the process instance with respect to the workflow model, the values of the associated case data variables at the time at which the event occurs, and the data embedded in the event. In the second stage, we consider that the reaction to each interruption event may also depend on the other events that have also been detected, that is, we allow interruptions to be defined through event patterns or complex events. We thus consider the issues of definition, analysis and enactment for both 'basic' and 'extended' interruption policy models. First, we introduce a method to model interruption policies in an intuitive but executable manner such that they may be maintained without technical support. We then address the issue of execution, detailing the required system functionality and proposing a reference architecture for the automatic enforcement of the policies. Finally, we introduce a set of formal, generic correctness criteria and a verification procedure for the models. For extended policy models, we introduce and compare two alternative execution models for the evaluation of logical expressions that represent interruption patterns. Finally, we present a thorough analysis of related verification issues, considering both the system and user perspectives, in order to ensure correct process execution and also provide support for the user in semantic validation of the interruption policies.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">workflow systems</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="subject">verification</field><field name="subject">business processes</field><field name="subject">expression evaluation</field><field name="subject">rules</field><field name="subject">specification</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:202127</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EFFICIENT GRID COMPUTING BASED ALGORITHMS FOR POWER SYSTEM DATA ANALYSIS</field><field name="creator">Mohsin Ali</field><field name="description">The role of electric power systems has grown steadily in both scope and importance over time making electricity increasingly recognized as a key to social and economic progress in many developing countries. In a sense, reliable power systems constitute the foundation of all prospering societies. The constant expansion in electric power systems, along with increased energy demand, requires that power systems become more and more complex. Such complexity results in much uncertainty which demands comprehensive reliability and security assessment to ensure reliable energy supply. Power industries in many countries are facing these challenges and are trying to increase the computational capability to handle the ever-increasing data and analytical needs of operations and planning. Moreover, the deregulated electricity markets have been in operation in a number of countries since the 1990s. During the deregulation process, vertically integrated power utilities have been reformed into competitive markets, with initial goals to improve market efficiency, minimize production costs and reduce the electricity price. Given the benefits that have been achieved by deregulation, several new challenges are also observed in the market. Due to fundamental changes to the electric power industry, traditional management and analysis methods cannot deal with these new challenges. Deterministic reliability assessment criteria still exists but it doesn&#8217;t satisfy the probabilistic nature of power systems. In the deterministic approach the worst case analysis results in excess operating costs. On the other hand, probabilistic methods are now widely accepted. The analytical method uses a mathematical formula for reliability evaluation and generates results more quickly but it needs accurate and a lot of assumptions and is not suitable for large and complex systems. Simulation based techniques take care of much uncertainty and simulates the random behavior of the system. However, it requires much computing power, memory and other computing resources. Power engineers have to run thousands of times domain simulations to determine the stability for a set of credible disturbances before dispatching. For example, security analysis is associated with the steady state and dynamic response of the power system to various disturbances. It is highly desirable to have real time security assessment, especially in the market environment. Therefore, novel analysis methods are required for power systems reliability and security in the deregulated environment, which can provide comprehensive results, and high performance computing (HPC) power in order to carry out such analysis within a limited time. Further, with the deregulation in power industry, operation control has been distributed among many organizations. The power grid is a complex network involving a range of energy resources including nuclear, fossil and renewable energy resources with many operational levels and layers including control centers, power plants and transmission and distribution systems. The energy resources are managed by different organizations in the electricity market and all these participants (including producers, consumers and operators) can affect the operational state of the power grid at any time. Moreover, adequacy analysis is an important task in power system planning and can be regarded as collaborative tasks, which demands the collaboration among the electricity market participants for reliable energy supply. Grid computing is gaining attention from power engineering experts as an ideal solution to the computational difficulties being faced by the power industry. Grid computing infrastructure involves the integrated and collaborative use of computers, networks, databases and scientific instruments owned and managed by multiple organizations. Grid computing technology offers potentially feasible support to the design and development of grid computing based infrastructure for power system reliability and security analysis. It can help in building infrastructure, which can provide a high performance computing and collaborative environment, and offer an optimal solution between cast and efficiency. While power system analysis is a vast topic, only a limited amount of research has been initiated in several places to investigate the applications of grid computing in power systems. This thesis will investigate probabilistic based reliability and security analysis of complex power systems in order to develop new techniques for providing comprehensive result with enormous efficiency. A review of existing techniques was conducted to determine the computational needs in the area of power systems. The main objective of this research is to propose and develop a general framework of computing grid and special grid services for probabilistic power system reliability and security assessment in the electricity market. As a result of this research, grid computing based techniques are proposed for power systems probabilistic load flow analysis, probabilistic small signal analysis, probabilistic transient stability analysis, and probabilistic contingencies analysis. Moreover, a grid computing based system is designed and developed for the monitoring and control of distributed generation systems. As a part of this research, a detailed review is presented about the possible applications of this technology in other aspects of power systems. It is proposed that these grid based techniques will provide comprehensive results that will lead to great efficiency, and ultimately enhance the existing computing capabilities of power companies in a cost-effective manner. At a part of this research, a small scale computing grid is developed which will consist of grid services for probabilistic reliability and security assessment techniques. A significant outcome of this research will be the improved performance, accuracy, and security of data sharing and collaboration. More importantly grid based computing will improve the capability of power system analysis in a deregulated environment where complex and large amounts of data would otherwise be impossible to analyze without huge investments in computing facilities.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">power system analysis</field><field name="subject">Grid Computing</field><field name="subject">Grid computing based monitoring and control</field><field name="subject">parallel and distributed computing</field><field name="subject">embedded generation system monitoring and control</field><field name="subject">emerging techniques in power system analysis</field><field name="subject">power system security analysis</field><field name="subject">analysis computing grid</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204801</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metabolic depression in Cyclorana alboguttata and the potential role of the endogenous opioid system and thyroid axis as regulators of aestivation.</field><field name="creator">Sara Kayes</field><field name="description">Metabolic depression is a ubiquitous characteristic of dormancy, allowing animals to survive off limited endogenous fuels supplies for extended periods of time. Metabolic depression is characterised by a complex set of physiological and biochemical changes (respiratory depression, bradycardia, hypophagia and cessation of renal function), in addition to a remarkable ability to prevent or minimise damage usually associated with such depressive changes (e.g. gut and muscle atrophy, renal failure and ischemic injuries). A coordinated shut-down of systems is essential to surviving long periods of dormancy, however, the mechanisms involved in regulating metabolic depression remain poorly understood. Aestivation, a period of dormancy that occurs in response to desiccating environments, provides an excellent model system for investigating the regulation of metabolic depression, because unlike other forms of dormancy such as hibernation, it is not confounded by changes in temperature or PO2 and thus represents a true intrinsic metabolic depression. The green striped burrowing frog, Cyclorana alboguttata, is an abundant species of burrowing frog inhabiting arid to semi-arid regions of Queensland and Northern New South Wales. During the dry season, C. alboguttata aestivates in an underground clay chamber; the aestivating period lasts on average for nine months a year, but in drought conditions may last for as long as several years. In recent years, C. alboguttata has become a well studied organism for investigating the physiological processes involved in aestivation, especially regarding muscle disuse atrophy and gut maintenance. Despite this, our understanding of this frog&#8217;s capacity to metabolically depress remains limited. The first aim of this study was to extend our current knowledge of metabolic depression during aestivation in C. alboguttata. C. alboguttata reduced whole animal metabolism by 82% within five weeks of aestivation. The effects of aestivation on mass specific in vitro tissue metabolic rate (VO2) varied among individual organs, with muscle and liver slices showing significant reductions in metabolism; kidney VO2 was elevated and there was no change in the VO2 of small intestine tissue slices. Organ size was also affected by aestivation, with significant reductions in the mass of all tissues, except the gastrocnemius. These reductions in organ size, combined with changes in mass specific VO2 of tissue slices, resulted in further energy savings to aestivating animals. Mitochondrial VO2 was significantly reduced during aestivation, by an average of 83%; in addition respiratory control ratios (RCRs), a measurement of mitochondrial coupling efficiency, significantly increased during aestivation, suggesting increased mitochondrial coupling efficiency. The second aim of this study was to investigate the potential role of the endogenous opioid system (EOS) and thyroid hormones in the regulation of metabolic depression in C. alboguttata. When incubated in the presence of opioid agonists, liver and muscle tissue slices from Cyclorana alboguttata underwent tissue- and agonist- specific metabolic depression. In most cases, the effect of opioid agonists on metabolism was more pronounced in tissue slices from aestivating animals. The delta (&#948;) opioid agonist DADLE was the most consistent in producing a metabolic depression, however the effect of DADLE on the metabolism of tissue slices was not reversible by the general opioid antagonist naloxone. Gene transcript levels for the &#948;-opioid receptor remained constant in the brain and in the muscle of aestivating C. alboguttata compared to controls. Opioid receptor XOR1 transcript levels also remained constant in the brain during aestivation compared to controls. There was a significant reduction in total thyroid hormone concentration in the plasma of C. alboguttata during aestivation, with thyroxine (T4) decreasing by 75% and an 84% reduction in triiodothyronine (T3). We also examined changes in gene expression of deiodinase 2 (D2) and deiodinase 3 (D3), the major activating and deactivating enzymes of thyroid hormones, respectively. There were no significant changes in gene expression of D2 in the brain or muscle, or of D3 in the brain; however there was a significant down-regulation of D3 transcripts in muscle tissue. In the liver, D2 was significantly down-regulated and D3 showed an increase in transcript levels that was approaching significance. During dormancy energy conservation is a key priority and as such dormant animals undergo a major metabolic depression to conserve their limited endogenous fuel supplies. At the same time, dormant animals are faced with the challenge of maintaining functional organs for immediate use upon arousal. In this study C. alboguttata appeared to selectively down- or up-regulating individual tissues, using both changes in metabolic rate and morphology. This strategy would allow maximal energy savings during aestivation without compromising organ functionality and survival at arousal. In addition, the frogs appeared to decrease rates of mitochondrial proton leak to a greater extent than ATP synthesis, consistent with an increase in mitochondrial coupling efficiency. Again, this ability to selectively down-regulate one process to a greater extent than another allows energy savings to be maximised without compromising processes essential for survival. C. alboguttata can survive in a dormant state for several years and it is hypothesised that these frogs become more energy efficient during aestivation. The regulation of metabolic depression still remains poorly understood. In this study the potential role of the EOS and thyroid hormones in regulating metabolic depression was investigated. The results of this study suggest the &#948;-opioid system may be responsible for the initiation of metabolic depression, while the mu (&#956;) and kappa (&#954;) opioid systems may be important during long term maintenance of aestivation. In addition, the EOS may exert its control over metabolism via both receptor and non-receptor mediated pathways. The significant down-regulation of total thyroid hormones, as well as the changes in gene expression of the thyroid deiodinases indicates thyroid hormones may also play a significant role in regulating metabolic depression. This suggests that the regulation of metabolic depression may involve several interacting systems, or perhaps a &#8216;systems cascade&#8217;.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">down-regulation</field><field name="subject">mitochondria</field><field name="subject">oxygen consumption</field><field name="subject">organ size</field><field name="subject">opioid</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="subject">anuran</field><field name="subject">thyroxine</field><field name="subject">triiodothyronine</field><field name="subject">thyroid deiodinases</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205412</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PROFILES AND INSTRUCTIONAL INTERVENTIONS OF READING COMPREHENSION: A Study of Upper Primary School Students in Urban Sub District BCL in Bandung, Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Sri Tiatri</field><field name="description">International studies have shown the reading competence of Indonesian students to be relatively low compared to other countries. Considering the importance of reading comprehension, the current research has two aims. The first is to provide some insight into the identification of students&#8217; difficulty with reading. The second is to investigate the implementation of innovative methods for teaching reading comprehension in the Indonesian educational context. Both studies were conducted in state upper grade primary schools in Urban Sub District BCL in Bandung, Indonesia. Study One profiled students&#8217; reading performance. Five measurement instruments were developed, written in Indonesian language. The construction of mental models was also introduced. Two hundred and sixty five Grade Five students from eight schools were measured for their competence in decoding, prior knowledge, comprehension monitoring, construction of mental models, reading comprehension specifically related to a particular topic, and their general reading comprehension. The students&#8217; reading performance profiles were very varied. They showed the importance of each component for the achievement of reading comprehension. The profiles also showed the ability for each component of reading comprehension to compensate each other&#8217;s function to enable the students to perform well in reading comprehension. The best-fit model for the data accounted for 47% of students&#8217; performance in reading comprehension. Study Two compared instructional interventions, and examined the way each method worked in the Indonesian educational context. The three instructional intervention methods were Reciprocal Teaching (RT), Instruction prompting students to develop Mental Models (IMM), and Instruction in Question Answering (IQA). Participants were one hundred and twelve students in the Sixth Grade from three primary schools. There were three groups in each school. Group 1 received RT followed by IMM (RT-IMM), Group 2 received IMM followed by RT (IMM-RT), and Group 3 received IQA. Group 3 was considered as the control group, since IQA is the traditional method widely adopted in Indonesia. Instruction was separated into 2 phases. Each phase consisted of four sessions of 30 minutes each over a two-week period. The implementation of IMM-RT tended to improve general reading comprehension more than other methods (RT-IMM and IQA). Interestingly, individuals who had a low performance in the pre-test for construction of mental models, improved their performance in the construction of mental models following implementation of RT at the first phase. The results support a conclusion that the IMM-RT combination is potentially effective for the enhancement of students&#8217; reading comprehension. However, further results showed that, in order to implement RT and IMM in a common state school classroom in Indonesia, the teacher&#8217;s ability to manage and organise the group becomes crucial. Study Three was designed to validate the IMM-RT instructional intervention for improving performances of students with reading comprehension inadequacies, by addressing the limitations found in Study Two. Result showed that IMM-RT had potential for improving students&#8217; performance in reading comprehension. The findings of the current study provide some understanding of reading comprehension in an Indonesian educational context. Moreover, the findings will add to the repertoire of educators about issues that need to be considered in implementing innovative methods for enhancing Indonesian students&#8217; reading comprehension.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reading comprehension</field><field name="subject">decoding</field><field name="subject">prior knowledge</field><field name="subject">comprehension monitoring</field><field name="subject">mental model</field><field name="subject">intervention</field><field name="subject">reciprocal teaching</field><field name="subject">question answering</field><field name="subject">Indonesian context</field><field name="subject">teacher</field><field name="subject">students</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205497</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Middle years students producing digital videos in science.</field><field name="creator">Geoffrey Hilton</field><field name="description">This study investigated the incorporation of student video production into Year 7 science classes and determined associated learning benefits. Availability of digital cameras and movie editing software make student in-class video production a possibility. However, the introduction of technology into classrooms often precedes an understanding of its effective utilisation. While the science classroom was ideal to utilise the audio/visual benefits of video production, a framework to streamline and guide students&#8217; production was needed to ensure productive learning. The writing-to-learn in science model (Prain &amp; Hand, 1996a) and Science Writing Heuristic (Hand &amp; Keys, 1999) were selected to fulfil this role. The adaptation of the writing-to-learn in science model to include video production as a text type coincided with a call from Prain (2006) to extend research to determine the influence of &#8220;new technology-mediated, multimodal learning environments&#8221; (p. 79) on students&#8217; science learning. Two intact Year 7 classes conducted the same science investigation following the writing-to-learn in science model, one class (Yr 7A, N = 21) used digital video to record and report their findings while the other class (Yr 7B, N = 22) used a traditional method of poster making. Students worked in mixed gender and ability groups of three. Data instruments included pretest, posttest, delayed posttest, a repeated question instruments, and content analysis of the students&#8217; final products. Two groups from each class were video tracked throughout their investigations and were later interviewed. Video data were transcribed and analysed to determine patterns of learning behaviour. This study showed that video production fits comfortably into the writing-to-learn in science framework. Making videos in science delivered learning advantages through the audio/visual nature of video production and the learning behaviours the production process elicited. The nature of video, as a visual and oral medium, allowed students to capture their science investigations accurately and then continue to manipulate the content through reviewing and editing. Through video production, students demonstrated heightened awareness of, and responsibility for, the learning of their audience that led to rehearsal of science concepts before filming. Data analysis revealed that video students collaborated, used higher order thinking, and engaged in the underlying scientific concepts more than the poster makers. This study is significant as it explores in a science classroom context, an emerging technology, already widely utilised in students&#8217; out-of-school lives. Science educators are calling for the broadening of what constitutes a scientific text, the greater inclusion and manipulation of multi-modal representations for science students, and an increased emphasis on socio-communicative approaches to science learning. Additionally, incorporation of technology and associated means of learning, authentic to many students&#8217; out-of-school lives, is advocated for the classroom. Student video production in science answers these calls. It achieves this while delivering unique learning benefits that add significantly to student attainment in science. Video production is playing a greater role in acquisition and dissemination of science knowledge. The use of video production in science and society would seem destined to increase exponentially. This study has investigated one application of the use of video production in a middle years science class, however the implications for further research are vast as the technology develops, the societal usage increases, and the scientific applications of video production become more powerful and widespread.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">student video production</field><field name="subject">science</field><field name="subject">audience</field><field name="subject">rehearsal</field><field name="subject">collaboration</field><field name="subject">representation of concepts</field><field name="subject">higher order thinking</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205722</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Digital technologies and multimodal communication in the chemistry classroom</field><field name="creator">Annette Hilton</field><field name="description">Students of chemistry encounter difficulties due to its abstract nature and the need to understand and communicate its concepts on macro, submicro, and symbolic levels using a range of representations and representational modes. Research suggests that when students are required to use multiple representations they have difficulties in understanding individual representations and in negotiating meaning through their use. This study sought to address these issues through the application of digital technologies. The main areas of research that provided a theoretical framework for this study were multiple representations in chemistry education and writing-to-learn in science. Other research in these areas has suggested that a better understanding of multiple representations might enhance students&#8217; chemical literacy; however, limited research has investigated the impact of using digital technologies to create multimodal texts on students&#8217; learning in chemistry, particularly the development of students&#8217; skills in generating and integrating multiple representations. Until recently, much of the writing-to-learn research has focused on written composition. The knowledge-transforming model was proposed by Bereiter and Scardamalia (1987) to explain the influence of written composition on knowledge construction. However, having been developed prior to the time when students had ready access to digital technologies and a consequent capacity to create multimedia and digital texts, this model does not account for the production of such multimodal texts. This study examined the effect of learning experiences that utilised digital technologies to support students in using multiple representations and through writing-to-learn activities to create multimodal texts on learning outcomes in chemistry. The study was conducted in a metropolitan public co-educational high school in Queensland, Australia. Two Year 11 chemistry classes participated in the study, which was conducted in the first term of a 2-year course in which students learn chemistry as a separate discipline. The study consisted of a pilot study and an intervention study with two phases. The pilot study was used to trial the learning activities and data collection instruments and to gain an insight into instructional approaches that might be appropriate for the study. Phase 1 of the intervention study employed a pretest&#8211;posttest design. In this phase, students learned about chemical bonding and structure and their effects on the properties and behaviours of different materials. They also learned about the multiple representations used to understand and communicate about chemical bonding and structure. Within a modified crossover design, Phase 2 of the study employed mixed methods to compare the effects on learning outcomes when they created two different scientific texts: a digital poster and a laboratory report. Both text types required students to integrate multiple representations to report on their learning during laboratory investigations. These text types were chosen because they are commonly used by scientists to communicate their experimental findings. In Phase 1, students engaged in computer-based inquiries using both molecular modelling and simulation software to investigate phenomena such as intra- and inter-molecular bonding and their effects on properties, the differences between various types of bonds, the multiple representations used to describe and investigate bonding and structure, and to present their understanding to others. In Phase 2, students used a range of scaffolding resources to design and carry out two inquiries about the chemistry of biomaterials. In the first inquiry, students made and compared the properties of two different bioplastic films; in the second, students compared the relative fermentation rates of a range of carbohydrates. In both inquiries, students were required to report their findings and explain them on the submicro level using appropriate representations. Scaffolds included Science Writing Heuristics, which explicitly required students to consider which multiple representations would support their claims and explanations of data; digital resources for selecting, modifying, or creating representations; and genre templates. Pretest&#8211;posttest comparisons for both phases showed that the instructional approaches and resources used were effective for enhancing students&#8217; learning outcomes. In all comparisons, the posttest performances were significantly higher. In the first phase, several of the identified alternative or missing conceptions about chemical bonding were effectively addressed, and in both phases, students&#8217; conceptual understanding and their representational competencies were enhanced. The pretest&#8211;posttest comparisons for Phase 2 suggested that creating a diversified text &#8211; a digital poster &#8211; for explaining experimental results is at least as effective for enhancing understanding and representational competencies as creating a more traditional laboratory report. Other data were analysed to gain an insight into how or why the instructional strategies and resources used might have been effective. The student interviews revealed a number of advantages of using digital technologies, including promotion of higher order thinking, enhanced motivation and interest, the capacity of digital technologies to support and enhance visualisation, and the production of multiple representations in multiple modes. Students suggested that the digital resources allowed them to make links between macroscopic, molecular, and symbolic levels and to include a range of representations in their explanations. The evaluation questionnaire revealed similar trends. Analysis of the students&#8217; texts suggested that the approaches used in Phase 2 were effective in supporting students&#8217; content and rhetorical problem solving and the interactions between the two. Students utilised a range of representations, particularly structural diagrams, when making explanations of their macroscopic data on the submicro level. This study has implications for the instructional approaches used by chemistry teachers because it showed that integrating digital technologies into learning environments is effective when introducing students to the multiple representations used in chemistry and in the development of students&#8217; chemical literacies. It also contributes to writing-to-learn research by focusing on multimodal communication and the benefits of creating multimodal texts for presenting, organising, and explaining data, and for representing knowledge. Significant findings of the study relate to the importance of digital technologies in generating multimodal texts and representations for instruction, scaffolding, and in student-centred inquiry-based learning. Further research might focus on the use of such resources for addressing other commonly identified alternative conceptions, the creation of other multimodal text types, the use of other digital technologies or authoring tools, or on the development of teachers&#8217; technological pedagogical content knowledge, which is required for effective classroom implementation of these resources and strategies.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">chemistry education</field><field name="subject">writing-to-learn</field><field name="subject">multimodality</field><field name="subject">multiple representations</field><field name="subject">representational competence</field><field name="subject">educational technology</field><field name="subject">chemical literacy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205719</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantifying Oxidative Stress and its Role in Mitochondrial Biogenesis</field><field name="creator">Natalie Strobel</field><field name="description">Oxidative and nitrosative stress are deleterious physiological processes caused by an imbalance between reactants such as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and antioxidants. Due to the links between oxidative and nitrosative stress and disease, there is much interest in accurately quantifying these in biological and physiological samples. There are numerous methods to quantify the in vivo oxidative and nitrosative damage to lipids, DNA and proteins however they are generally time-consuming, expensive and difficult. Furthermore, due to the complex nature of oxidative and nitrosative stress it would be appropriate to measure a number of different biomarkers, however this is rarely done. The first section of this thesis contains research aimed at developing a bioassay to simultaneously detect markers of oxidative and nitrosative stress. This includes; 1) a review of the studies investigating the ability of these biomarkers to predict the onset of disease, 2) a description of the attempts to develop the bioassay, 3) a study designed to test the sensitivity of the bioassay to detect changes in oxidative stress. Unfortunately, the attempts to develop the bioassay were not as successful as hoped and, in the interests of completing the PhD in the time allowed, the PhD changed focus to look at the effects of oxidant:antioxidant balance on mitochondrial biogenesis. The second section of the thesis contains a review of the literature on this topic and two original investigations. It is well documented that oxidative and nitrosative stress contributes to the progression of many diseases including; cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, kidney disease and cancer. To determine which biomarkers would have the greatest efficacy in the bioassay, a comprehensive review was undertaken. The aim of the review was to investigate studies which have measured oxidative and nitrosative biomarkers to determine whether they are independent predictors of cardiovascular events (Chapter two). From the review, fifty-one studies were identified with twenty-six of these measuring oxidised (Ox)-LDL, fifteen assessing myeloperoxidase (MPO), seven using lipid peroxidation measures and three quantifying protein oxidation in plasma/serum. The recommendation of the review was that all areas require further investigation, however, it was determined that Ox-LDL and MPO would be beneficial for inclusion in the bio-assay. Other biomarkers considered for the bio-assay were nitrotyrosine, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. Chapter three outlines method development used to measure the oxidative and nitrosative markers simultaneously. Recent technology allows multiple analytes to be detected simultaneously from the one sample. The Mulit-plex system is used to detect analytes that have been sandwiched between primary capture and secondary biotinylated detection antibodies. The secondary antibody attaches to streptavidin-phycoerythrin and is used by the Mulit-plex analyser to quantify the analyte. During development of the bio-assay, clumping of microspheres, high background, no detection of standard curve or samples, matrix effects, mislabeling of antibodies by manufacturers and lack of commercial available antibodies were obstacles that limited the success of this method. MPO was the only biomarker that was successful. Chapter four contains a study that investigated the sensitivity of the MPO mulitplex bio-assay. Nine highly trained cyclists underwent an extensive exercise protocol designed to induce dehydration by 4 % body mass, rehydration of 150 % fluid loss and a performance time-trial. Plasma samples were taken at five time points; baseline, post dehydration, post rehydration, pre time-trial and post time-trial and analysed using the mulitplex bio-assay. The results showed that there was a significant increase in MPO post dehydration and post time-trial compared with all other time points (P&lt;0.05), thereby demonstrating that the mulitplex bio-assay is sensitive to detect changes in exercise and appropriate rehydration reduces oxidative stress. The MPO mulitplex bio-assay requires further testing on patients with diseases to further validate its future applications. As mentioned above, due to time constraints it was decided to stop the attempts to create a multi-analyte bioassay and focus on another important area of cellular oxidative stress. Currently, there is much interest in the involvement of oxidant:antioxidant balance in mitochondrial biogenesis. The increase of mitochondrial content within the skeletal muscle, termed mitochondrial biogenesis, provides an increased capacity to generate ATP during exercise and is recognized as one of major cellular adaptations to exercise. Reactive oxygen species are produced during exercise and have been shown to induce mitochondrial biogenesis. One of the key instigators of mitochondrial biogenesis is peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator-1&#945; (PGC-1&#945;). PGC-1&#945; is central to the transcription of mitochondrial and nuclear encoded genes, which regulate downstream pathways such as oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation. Antioxidant supplementation is common among athletes and healthy individuals; however, antioxidant supplements suppress reactive oxygen species and could therefore could hinder mitochondrial biogenesis and the positive adaptations associated with exercise. To establish whether antioxidant supplementation reduced mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle, male Wistar rats were supplemented with &#945;-tocopherol and &#945;-lipoic acid for fourteen weeks (Chapter six). Animals were separated into four groups: 1) sedentary control diet, 2) sedentary antioxidant diet, 3) exercise control diet and 4) exercise antioxidant diet. The exercise animals were trained 5 days/week for 14 weeks. Consistent with increased mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant defences following training, there were significant increases in PGC-1&#945; mRNA and protein, COX IV and Cyt C protein abundance, citrate synthase activity, Nfe2l2 and SOD2 protein (P&lt;0.05). Antioxidant supplementation reduced PGC-1&#945; mRNA, PGC-1&#945; and COX IV protein, and citrate synthase enzyme activity (P&lt;0.05) in both sedentary and exercise-trained rats. In summary, antioxidants &#945;-tocopherol and &#61537;-lipoic acid supplementation suppresses beneficial adaptations in skeletal muscle such as markers of mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial proteins, regardless of training status. The reduction in mitochondrial biogenesis may affect exercise training adaptations and reduce the ability of healthy individuals to attain optimal exercise adaptations. The last investigation (Chapter seven) studied the effect of reduced glutathione, through diethyl maleate (DEM) administration, on upstream regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis, markers of mitochondrial biogenesis and downstream signalling. Glutathione is a key antioxidant that reduces the amount of hydrogen peroxide. Male Wistar rats were divided into six groups 1) sedentary control, 2) sedentary DEM, 3) post-exercise control, 4) post-exercise DEM, 5) exercise-recovery and 6) exercise-recovery DEM. After an exercise bout to fatigue, animals were euthanized directly after exercise (post-exercise) or four hours post exercise (exercise-recovery). Exercising animals given DEM had significantly (P&lt;0.05) decreased glutathione in skeletal muscle and had a significantly (P&lt;0.05) greater increase in PGC-1&#945; gene expression. There were also main interaction effects between exercise and DEM administration on SOD2 activity. Exercise altered the gene expression of GPx and the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. Glutathione depletion decreased GPX activity and oxidised glutathione levels. These novel findings represent important in vivo evidence of the involvement of glutathione and oxidant:antioxidant balance in mitochondrial biogenisis.

The significance of NRs in human health and disease is underscored by the availability of drugs that targets NRs for treating several diseases. In this context, a subgroup of NR family has been proposed to regulate metabolism in a cell/tissue specific manner. The Rev-erb subgroup of NRs consists of two isoforms Rev-erb and Rev-erb. These two receptors have been shown to regulate different aspects of human physiology such as metabolism, inflammation, and circadian rhythm. Many NRs are expressed in skeletal muscle, a major mass peripheral tissue that accounts for ~40% of the total body weight and energy expenditure. This lean tissue is a major site for lipid and glucose homeostasis. Skeletal muscle express and secrete cytokines which perform autocrine and paracrine function with other tissues such as adipose. Accordingly, skeletal muscle plays important role in blood lipid profile, insulin sensitivity and progression of diseases such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. In addition, many studies have shown that NRs in skeletal muscle regulate glucose, lipid and energy homeostasis. Therefore, understanding the function of NRs in skeletal muscle provides a platform for potential new therapeutic treatments for metabolic disease. Rev-erb is expressed in skeletal muscle; however the function of this receptor in skeletal muscle metabolism has not been examined. Nevertheless, considering the importance of Rev-erb subfamily in metabolism, circadian control and the role of skeletal muscle in lipid homeostasis, the function of Rev-erb in skeletal muscle metabolism needs to be further investigated. We tested the hypothesis that Rev-erb (directly and/or indirectly) regulated the genetic programs that control lipid homeostasis in skeletal muscle. Initially, we exogenously expressed a truncated version of Rev-erb without the ligand-binding domain (Rev-erb) in vitro (in the C2C12 skeletal muscle cell culture system); and in vivo (in mouse tibialis anterior muscle. Moreover, we also attenuated Rev-erb expression in skeletal muscle cells using siRNAs targeting N-terminus and hinge regions of Rev-erb. We performed candidate based expression profiling utilizing quantitative RT-PCR analysis on the Taqman Low Density Array (TLDA) platform to identify putative downstream primary and/or secondary targets of Rev-erb action in skeletal muscle cells in the context of metabolism and muscle growth. Exogenous expression of Rev-erb in skeletal muscle cells in vitro decreased the expression of several genes involved in fatty acid/lipid absorption (including Cd36, and Fabp3 and 4). Interestingly, the mRNA encoding the master lipogenic regulator, SREBP-1c was also increased after ectopic Rev-erb expression. Moreover, we observed significant induction in the mRNAs encoding interleukin-6 and IKB that are involved in the regulation of the inflammatory cascade. Finally, we also observed the marked repression of myostatin mRNA, an important protein implicated in negative regulation of muscle hypertrophy/hyperplasia and a positive regulator of body fat accumulation. In summary, our in vitro study suggested that Rev-erb regulates genes involved in metabolism, inflammation and muscle growth. Quantitative PCR analysis that utilised the Taqman Low Density Array (TLDA) platform revealed Rev-erb siRNA expression down-regulated (in a subtle but significant manner) several genes involved in lipid/glucose homeostasis and the TGF- signalling pathway. Interestingly, genes that are involved in the myostatin and TGF- signalling pathway such as Activin A receptor type 2a (ACVR2A), Smad specific E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (Smurf1), and TGF- receptor 2 (TGFBR2) were identified potential (direct and/or indirect) target of Rev-erb action in skeletal muscle cells. Moreover, genes such as Citrate Synthase (CS), V-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 2 (Akt2), Peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor- coactivator (PGC)-1 (PGC1) were also significantly modulated by Rev-erb in these analyses. The expression of two mRNAs encoding a) SREBP1c and b) IKB increased by ectopic Rev-erb expression was examined in more detail. These were selected because Rev-erb has been presumed to function as a transcriptional silencer. Secondly, we had demonstrated that in vivo expression of Rev-erb (after injection and electroporation of mouse tibialis anterior muscle) increased SREBP-1c expression, and Rev-erb siRNA studies suggested that this orphan NR was necessary for optimal SREBP-1c mRNA expression. Consequently, we tested the hypothesis that Rev-erb encodes the potential to function as a transcriptional activator in skeletal muscle. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether the SREBP1c and IKB promoters were trans-activated by co-transfected Rev-erb in skeletal muscle cells. We initially tested whether Rev-erb regulates the SREBP1c promoter. Transfection experiments showed Rev-erb expression trans-activated this promoter. This observation was in contrast to previous promoter studies showing that Rev-erb is a potent repressor of gene transcription. Therefore, we subsequently performed an experiment in which we simultaneously used the Rev-erb promoter (previously characterized to be repressed by Rev-erb) and SREBP1c promoter to examine the effect of Rev-erb expression. This experiment showed that Rev-erb repressed the activity of Rev-erb promoter, and in parallel trans-activated the SREBP1c promoter. Bioinformatics analysis identified two regions covering putative Rev-erb response elements RERE1 (-1342 to -1158) and RERE2 (-525 to -401) in the SREBP1c promoter. Chromatin immuno-precipitation assays demonstrated that Rev-erb is selectively recruited to RERE2 between nucleotide positions &#8211;525 to &#8211;401 in the promoter. Unidirectional deletion analysis of the SREBP1c promoter coupled with the analysis of mutants in the LXR response elements (of the SREBP-1c promoter) confirmed that Rev-erb mediated trans-activation of SREBP1c promoter does not function through LXR response elements. Interestingly, treatment of skeletal muscle cells with Hemin, a molecule recently proposed to function as a ligand for Rev-erbs, increased SREBP1c mRNA expression. In summary these data show that Rev-erb is a novel positive regulator of SREBP1c mRNA expression in skeletal muscle. We subsequently cloned the previously characterised human IKB promoter region spanning the potential ROR and Rev-erb binding site. Transfection experiments showed that in accordance to previously published observation, ROR trans-activated the IKB promoter. However, both Rev-erb and Rev-erb when co-transfected with the IKB promoter had minimal effects on the activity of this promoter. Studies have shown that Rev-erb functions as a competitor for ROR and block ROR mediated trans-activation of its target gene expression. Interestingly, our co-transfection experiments showed that both Rev-erb and Rev-erb blocks ROR-mediated trans-activation of IKB promoter. Together, this data suggests that Rev-erb-mediated regulation of IKB transcription in skeletal muscle cells could occur through indirect mechanisms. In conclusion, our studies have shown Rev-erb directly and indirectly regulates the expression of genes involved in metabolism, inflammation and muscle growth suggesting that Rev-erb in skeletal muscle has the potential to be exploited in a therapeutic manner.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nuclear receptors, Rev-erb beta, skeletal muscle, gene expression, metabolism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205945</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing Environmental Balance Sheet Accounts to Measure Sustainability</field><field name="creator">Evan Thomas</field><field name="description">Abstract The resilience, or sustainability, of an environmental system depends on key factors remaining within critical thresholds. Current approaches to assessing the condition and trend of environmental systems rely on expert knowledge of system performance and subjective interpretation. Computer simulation models of natural resource systems offer a way to integrate system properties, and ecological theory and relationships, with long-term climate and rainfall information to simulate system performance within a consistent framework. Financial accounting methods, such as balance sheets and ratio analysis, have been developed to assess overall businesses viability and offer a potential tool for assessing the sustainability of natural systems, providing key accounting principles and assumptions can be reasonably met. This thesis explores the integration of accounting and ecological theory in a balance sheet framework for sustainability accounting using non-financial terms with a view to contributing to the sustainable management of natural resources within dynamic systems. A generic approach to constructing environmental balance sheets was developed and tested at a range of scales (field to catchment). Sensitivity analysis of the models was used to determine key factors and critical thresholds relating to system resilience. These values were then used to construct the balance sheets. The current ratio was then used to identify if the system was being managed sustainably. A current ratio (assets/liabilities) greater than 1.0, derived from the balance sheet, was shown to denote more resilient, and hence sustainable, systems. Case studies used were wheat cropping in the Maranoa area of Queensland, Australia, and the Bonogin Valley in the Gold Coast, Queensland Australia The same approach to constructing balance sheets worked across all scales from farm to catchment. . The approach was then used to develop a sustainability assessment of the Coomera catchment of the Gold Coast to consider how natural resource management and urbanisation is affecting catchment resilience. A series of models was used to develop the accounts: a grazing systems model &#8211; SGS; a cropping systems model - APSIM-sugar; and an existing catchment hydrology and water quality model - EMSS. The approach demonstrated that sugarcane cropping systems within the catchment were not likely to be sustainable without significant input of nitrogen, but that the grazing systems were. Furthermore, the overall catchment was likely to be sustainable (2002). This finding is consistent with an independent field-based assessment of the catchment conducted by the Healthy Waterways Partnership of South East Queensland. The urban development anticipated in the catchment by 2020, did not appear to have a significant affect as measured by long-term trends in flow frequency and water quality. The use of ratio analysis provided a dimensionless variable that related to the resilience of a parcel of land or catchment. These values were able to be spatially integrated, using an area weighted median, to provide an overall estimate of resilience of land use for a farm or a catchment. However, it was considered simpler to model the catchment of interest as a whole rather than to combine ratios from a series of catchment sub-models. The availability of appropriate comprehensive systems models may prove a limitation for application to all land uses especially native bushland systems. However, the approach developed in this thesis provides a robust and consistent framework for exploring system resilience and sustainability in a way that can augment existing approaches to natural resource assessments of condition and trend.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">resilience, sustainability, balance sheets, environmental accounting, systems models, current ratio</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205954</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some Burning Questions</field><field name="creator">John Fraser</field><field name="description">Burn injuries represent a major cause of mortality and morbidity as well as a significant drain on limited resources, particularly in the developing world. Advances in resuscitation, critical care, protective ventilatory strategies, earlier complete debridement complemented by more aggressive treatment of burn wound sepsis have reduced the mortality of thermal injuries. There has also been a move to focus on education and prevention campaigns, which have borne fruit and resulted in some reduction in the incidence of burns in the paediatric population. Burn care, once a Cinderella specialty, has become a well focused multi-disciplinary specialty in its own right. Burn injury is dissimilar to many forms of trauma. In major burns, the initial trauma may be limited to the skin alone or skin and lungs, but all organ systems are rapidly involved as the physiological derangement becomes systemic. The burden of this multi-system insult is substantial. Globally, the World Health Organisation estimated that fire-associated burns alone directly resulted in over 320,000 deaths in 2002, and in the USA, approximately 1million children sustain burns each year. Australasian guidelines suggest that all adult burns with greater than 15% total body surface area (TBSA) and &gt;10% TBSA burn in children will require fluid resuscitation and possibly critical care support at some point in their hospitalisation. Mortality in these patients with severe burns follows a bimodal pattern of early and late deaths. Causes of early death comprise refractory shock, inability to obtain a safe airway or provide adequate oxygenation, co-existent trauma, non-survivable carboxyhaemoglobin poisoning, and decisions that injuries are non-compatible with recovery, leading to therapy withdrawal. With improved resuscitation strategies, 95% of patients survive the early resuscitation phase. Late deaths are secondary to sepsis normally associated with wound infection and multiple organ failure. The morbidity associated with burn injury continues well after the acute hospital admission, frequently for up to several years post burn injury, as is witnessed by prolonged rise in basal metabolic rate and worsening scar tissue1, 2. It has been calculated that in children approximately 60% of the cost of burn care occurs post wound closure; that is, dealing with the disabling and disfiguring contractures associated with hypertrophic scar3, 4. Hence, research and new modalities are being aimed at reducing cost of treatment and improving quality of life for survivors of burn injury. Thus, this PhD aims to reflect the multidisciplinary nature of modern day burn care, with the inclusion of seven published papers and one book chapter covering prevention and education relevant to paediatric burns, treatment and minimisation of wound infection , and scar minimisation, along with the first study into the relevance of fetal wound healing post burn injury.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">burns</field><field name="subject">smoke inhalation</field><field name="subject">scarless wound healing</field><field name="subject">amnion</field><field name="subject">ovine model</field><field name="subject">antimicrobial</field><field name="subject">silver</field><field name="subject">system inflammatory response syndrome</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205951</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Blooms of the toxic cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula in Moreton Bay: links to anthropogenic nutrients</field><field name="creator">Kathleen Ahern</field><field name="description">The increased proliferation of benthic marine cyanobacteria of the Lyngbya genus in many tropical and subtropical systems worldwide is a concern due to the detrimental impacts these blooms can have on ecosystems, local economies and public health. While increasing nutrient loads from anthropogenic sources/activities has been hypothesised as the main cause, evidence to support this is limited. This hypothesis was explored by investigating blooms of the toxic, benthic cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula in a sub-tropical shallow coastal embayment (Moreton Bay) in southeast Queensland, Australia&#8212;where blooms have increased in frequency and severity. More specifically, the thesis aimed to investigate the role of nutrients in the physiology and growth dynamics of L. majuscula in Moreton Bay through examination of three main research questions. Examination of the spatial and temporal variations in the growth and nutritional status of L. majuscula in Moreton Bay (Research Question 1) was investigated by tracking natural summer blooms in northeastern Moreton Bay (Deception Bay) over two successive years. Detailed field observations, extensive biomass and tissue nutrient sampling (every 10&#8211;14 days) and a three-dimensional model were used to map the change in areal extent, biomass and tissue nutrients over the course of the blooms. The results demonstrated the innate ability of L. majuscula to rapidly spread and generate massive amounts of biomass, with the peak biomass calculated at 5057 tww in the 2005&#8211;2006 and 10 213 tww in the 2006&#8211;2007 seasons. A sequence of phases showing differing appearance, biomass growth and tissue nutrient changes were identified and documented. The role of nutrients (individually and collectively) in the enhancement of L. majuscula growth (Research Question 2) was investigated using a combination of comprehensive laboratory experiments (filament growth, 14C-bicarbonate uptake rate and biomass increase) and in-situ field experiments. Addition of nutrients to the water column were shown to promote prolific L. majuscula growth in the laboratory; this was confirmed in field experiments at two locations in Moreton Bay&#8212;showing nutrients can be a major causal factor in bloom formation. Additions of phosphorus (macronutrient) and iron (required for photosynthesis and nitrogen-fixation) caused the greatest stimulation of L. majuscula in both laboratory and field experiments. The form of iron was shown to be important &#8212;organically complexed iron (FeEDTA) was substantially more effective in promoting L. majuscula growth under laboratory conditions than inorganic iron (FeCl3). This is important as FeEDTA mirrors the naturally occurring iron organic complexes (which increase the solubility of iron) in waters from the region. The effect of nitrogen additions was more complex&#8212;likely due to the capacity of L. majuscula to fix atmospheric nitrogen reducing reliance on an inorganic nitrogen source. In the high light conditions experienced in this study, L. majuscula appeared to acquire nitrogen: (i) directly from the dissolved inorganic nitrogen in the water column&#8212;evidenced by a positive response to the nitrogen treatments; and, (ii) through enhanced nitrogen-fixation rates when iron and/or phosphorus were added in the absence of nitrogen&#8212;inferred from a substantial increase in the total nitrogen content of the L. majuscula biomass (nitrogen-fixation was not measured directly). The main sources of naturally occurring nutrients likely to promote L. majuscula blooms in Moreton Bay (Research Question 3) were investigated using laboratory experiments, soil and water analyses, and GIS-based modelling. The potential for groundwater/surfacewater from different vegetation, soils, geology and landuses within the study area catchments to stimulate L. majuscula response (14C-bicarbonate uptake rate) was tested in laboratory bioassays. Areas with acid sulfate soils (ASS), Melaleuca vegetation, pine plantations and Casuarina on ASS all had waters that enhanced L. majuscula growth. To investigate causal agents, bioassay response data and water analyses were subject to multiple regression and correlation analysis; this confirmed the importance of iron, phosphorus and nitrogen to L. majuscula growth and the roles of low pH and dissolved organic carbon, the latter two appearing to influence the chemical state and enhance the solubility of nutrients to L. majuscula. This information was incorporated into a GIS-based model to identify areas of hazard which were most likely to supply/export nutrients to Moreton Bay. These hazard maps, with further local verification, will be used as planning and decision support tools to assist government and landuse managers to limit the mobilisation and transport of key nutrients to potential bloom sites. The results from this thesis demonstrate that a precautionary approach to limit phosphorus, iron, nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon to waterways is necessary; otherwise the magnitude of L. majuscula blooms is likely to increase in Moreton Bay as coastal development intensifies with the predicted population increase. The thesis findings provide strong support for the hypothesised link between nutrients and the increased proliferation of Lyngbya and other benthic cyanobacteria blooms and are likely to be applicable to other areas where environmental conditions are suitable for their growth.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">blooms</field><field name="subject">cyanobacterium</field><field name="subject">groundwater</field><field name="subject">iron</field><field name="subject">Lyngbya majuscula</field><field name="subject">nitrogen</field><field name="subject">nutrients</field><field name="subject">organics</field><field name="subject">phosphorus</field><field name="subject">runoff</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206003</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DNA methylation throughout the human colorectum: Person, Place and Pathology</field><field name="creator">Daniel Worthley</field><field name="description">There are two chief molecular pathways to sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC), the chromosomal instability (CIN) and the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) pathways. A third pathway, the pure microsatellite instability pathway, is important in inherited CRC specifically hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer. The CIN pathway is characterized by an adenomatous pathological precursor, aneuploidy and microsatellite stability. CIMP pathway cancers, however, are frequently proximal, develop from serrated rather than adenomatous polyps and are strongly associated with BRAF mutation. The CIMP pathway is driven primarily by epigenetic rather than genetic instability. These pathway-specific molecular traits are evident within the pathological precursors to these cancers and thus pathway divergence must occur at the beginning of carcinogenesis or even before. Although DNA methylation is recognized as a key mechanism in colorectal carcinogenesis, relatively little is known about its pattern, regulation and relevance in normal colorectal mucosa. This PhD thesis characterized the profile of DNA methylation in the normal human colorectum and explored its associations with luminal, environmental, dietary and pathological factors. The genes methylated in CRC are characterized as &#8220;type A&#8221; (Age-related) genes and &#8220;type C&#8221; (Cancer-specific) genes. Generally, &#8220;type A&#8221; genes are methylated in both normal and neoplastic tissue with the degree of methylation proportional to the age of the tissue. The methylation of &#8220;type C&#8221; genes, however, is more specific for neoplastic tissue. The primary study recruited 166 patients undergoing colonoscopy. At colonoscopy, mucosal biopsies were taken from the caecum, transverse colon, sigmoid colon and rectum. DNA methylation was analysed by MethyLight at &#8220;type A&#8221; (ESR1, GATA5, HIC1, HPP1, SFRP1) and &#8220;type C&#8221; methylation markers (MGMT, MLH1, CDKN2A, MINT2, MINT31, IGF2, CACNA1G, NEUROG1, SOCS1, RUNX3). LINE-1 methylation was quantified by pyrosequencing. The last 5 &#8220;type C&#8221; markers comprise a CIMP panel used to identify CIMP cancers. Mean &#8220;type A&#8221; and CIMP panel methylation Z-scores were calculated. The PMR for each of these CpG island loci was compared to patient age, gender, previous colorectal polyps, smoking history and the presence of concomitant pathology. Most &#8220;type A&#8221; genes demonstrated strong and direct correlations between methylation and patient age (e.g. ESR1, &#961;=0.66, p&lt;0.0001) and had greater methylation within the distal compared to the proximal colorectum (e.g. ESR1, p&lt;0.0001). On multivariate analysis, the mucosal &#8220;type A&#8221; methylation Z-score had a strong, independent, inverse association with the diagnosis of colorectal adenomas (OR=0.23, p&lt;0.001), the precursor to CIN cancers. The mean CIMP methylation Z-score in normal mucosa, however, was significantly and independently associated with advanced proximal serrated polyps (OR=5.1, p=0.009), the precursor to CIMP cancers. The luminal and epithelial associations with colorectal methylation were explored by a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. This experiment was undertaken to determine whether dietary supplementation could modulate epithelial DNA methylation. In addition, the study was designed to evaluate intra-individual reproducibility of the MethyLight technique. The study consisted of a 4 week cross-over trial of resistant starch and Bifidobacterium lactis either alone or as a combined synbiotic preparation, in 20 human volunteers. Rectal biopsies, faeces and serum were collected. Rectal mucosal endpoints included DNA methylation at the CpG island loci and LINE-1, epithelial proliferation (Ki67 immunohistochemistry) and crypt cellularity. Faecal short-chain fatty acid concentrations, pH, ammonia and microbiological profiles (by DGGE and sequencing) were examined. The synbiotic intervention fostered a significantly different faecal stream bacterial community than either the prebiotic or the probiotic interventions alone, but did not show any significant associations with the epithelial or luminal parameters. To explore possible associations between luminal and epithelial parameters and mucosal DNA methylation, the baseline indices were further analysed. There was a strong positive correlation between baseline epithelial proliferation and &#8220;type A&#8221; marker methylation (&#961; = 0.7, p = 0.0001). Thus, &#8220;type A&#8221; methylation may reflect the cellular age or mitotic burden of a tissue, which is a function of both time and cell turnover. There were consistent inverse trends evident between faecal short-chain fatty acid levels and rectal mucosal DNA methylation. This PhD project found that DNA methylation within the normal colorectal mucosa varied with patient age and region and was strongly associated with the development of pathway-specific pathology, suggesting that the background colorectal field may predict both the at-risk patients and at-risk pathways. Diet and the luminal environment more broadly may influence levels of DNA methylation in the colorectal mucosa and could help to explain regional patterns of colorectal DNA methylation.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dna Methylation</field><field name="subject">epigenetics</field><field name="subject">Colorectal Cancer</field><field name="subject">Carcinogenesis</field><field name="subject">nutrigenomics</field><field name="subject">Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of an intervention to prevent back pain in nurses and nursing students</field><field name="creator">Anna Dawson</field><field name="description">Nurses report high rates of back pain with consequent disability, work absenteeism and attrition from the profession. In the current climate of an international nursing shortage, efficacious interventions to reduce the impact of back pain must be developed. It is uncertain what components a back pain preventive intervention should comprise. Appropriate and reliable means to assess back pain and disability in nurses is also undetermined. The first aim of this thesis was to undertake a mixed methods program of research to inform the development of an intervention to prevent back pain in nurses. The second aim of the thesis was to examine the psychometric and measurement properties of back pain and disability outcome instruments frequently applied in nursing samples. Epidemiological studies were undertaken to examine factors associated with back pain in nursing cohorts. In student nurses, a history of manual handling work was found to be significantly associated with neck and back pain outcomes. In a large population cohort study of nurses and midwives, pain characteristics (pain severity and radiation), pain-related cognitive and behavioural factors (kinesiophobia and passive pain coping), job characteristics (job classification and manual handling task frequency) as well as demographic interactions explained sick leave due to back pain. A systematic review was undertaken to determine the efficacy of interventions aiming to prevent back pain and back injury in nurses. Due to methodological heterogeneity, a qualitative synthesis of evidence was undertaken on the 16 studies that met inclusion criteria. The review identified moderate level evidence from multiple trials that manual handling training in isolation is not effective and multidimensional interventions are effective in preventing back pain and injury in nurses. Single trials provided moderate evidence that stress management programs do not prevent back pain and limited evidence that lumbar supports are effective in preventing back injury in nurses. There was conflicting evidence regarding the efficacy of exercise interventions and the provision of manual handling equipment and training. A qualitative description study was employed to explore the beliefs and perceptions of nursing stakeholders regarding risk factors for back pain and strategies to prevent back pain in nurses. Stakeholders identified individual, intrapersonal, organisational and environmental risk factors that were consistent with the social ecological view of health. They believed that interventions targeting the individual would be ineffective in the absence of workplace and other reforms. At the individual level, they recommended strategies that address physical, psychological and occupational preparedness for nursing work. In addition, they suggested ecological intervention strategies to induce change at the intrapersonal, organisational, community and policy levels. A mixed method synthesis of evidence was performed to develop an evidence-based and stakeholder-relevant intervention that aims to reduce the impact of back pain in nurses. The proposed intervention incorporates evidence-based multidimensional strategies that address individual and organisational level factors, and proposes ecological factors that may warrant inclusion once evidence of their causal association with back pain is established. Methodological studies examined the psychometric and measurement properties of key instruments used to assess back pain and disability in nursing populations. An extended version of the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire &#8211; that is frequently modified when applied in nursing cohorts - was developed and deemed to have acceptable test-retest reliability. The Oswestry Disability Index was found to have unacceptable measurement properties for application in nursing samples, and is therefore not recommended for future studies of back pain related disability in the nursing population. In summary, this program of research contributes novel insights that can meaningfully inform understanding of back pain prevention in nurses. Factors not previously assessed in nursing populations have been examined and shown to be significantly related to back pain outcomes. The strength of existing evidence for the prevention of back pain and injury in nurses has been established, and methodological advances regarding appropriate and reliable measurement of back pain and disability have been made. The views and perceptions of stakeholders from multiple levels and vantage points have been considered and integrated within the interpretation of evidence from multiple mixed method studies. In fact, stakeholders have played a crucial role in the identification of an appropriate theoretical framework &#8211; the social ecological paradigm - to conceptualise back pain causality in nurses and identify relevant solutions. A future research agenda of expanded scope is implicated to adequately address back pain prevention in nurses.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Back pain</field><field name="subject">disability</field><field name="subject">sick leave</field><field name="subject">nurses</field><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">intervention</field><field name="subject">prevention</field><field name="subject">reliability</field><field name="subject">qualitative</field><field name="subject">focus group</field><field name="subject">mixed methods</field><field name="subject">logistic regression</field><field name="subject">systematic review</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205979</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#8220;Only another mother would understand&#8221; Parents&#8217; experiences of feeding their children with complex medical conditions</field><field name="creator">Lyndal Franklin</field><field name="description">With advances in neonatal, medical and surgical care there are an increasing number of infants and young children surviving with medical conditions. Many of these children have associated complex feeding difficulties as a result of the disruption to early oral feeding experiences and periods of restricted or non-oral feeding. These children are at risk of developing long-term feeding difficulties associated with sub-optimal nutrition and poor appetite regulation, delays in mastering skills that lead to eating and mealtime independence, and disruptive mealtime behaviours. Managing the extraordinary demands associated with feeding and ensuring nutrition for these children can present significant challenges for parents as well as health care professionals involved in their care. Occupational therapists are often core members of multidisciplinary teams providing hospital-based services to these children and their families. Embracing an occupation-centred perspective, participation in feeding and mealtimes are considered important co-occupations for infants, children and their parents and carers that occur within the context of parenting and family life. Understanding these contextual influences and the occupational needs of parents are essential but have been understated in the occupational therapy literature and clinical practice. This thesis describes a qualitative study using a phenomenological perspective to explore the lived experiences of parents of children with complex medical and feeding difficulties. Parents from fourteen families participated in the study. Data collection involved in-depth interviews, family mealtime observations and demographic questionnaires. Key findings indicated that parents experienced a high degree of stress in their everyday lives as a result of their children&#8217;s feeding difficulties, especially in relation to tube-feeding. Mothers&#8217; self-image was devastated because they believed that it was their ultimate responsibility to feed and nourish their children. Differences in how parents identified with and fulfilled their parenting roles and responsibilities emerged, not just in relation to feeding but also for other childcare and domestic activities. Overwhelmingly, it was mothers who assumed the greater share of these parenting responsibilities, and in addition, expressed a sense of responsibility for preserving family unity and the need to get on with family life despite the chronic nature of their children&#8217;s problems. These findings contribute to our understanding of the occupational challenges for parents of these children, especially mothers who have a primary role in feeding, and the impact of feeding disruptions on the lives of their families. This knowledge will assist clinicians providing feeding interventions to be more sensitive and responsive to the needs of both parents and other family members.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influences on teaching: Perceptions and experiences of university teachers</field><field name="creator">Jiao, Xiaomin</field><field name="description">This study attempts to deal with the complexity of academic life and what influences teachers and teaching in university. The case for the research rests on the premise that the complexities of the nature of influences and how they are perceived, experienced and responded to were underestimated and under-represented in the majority of previous studies in this area. The primary goal of this research is to offer a more holistic understanding of the phenomena by investigating perceptions, experiences and responses of a sample of 22 university teachers in New Zealand in relation to influences on their teaching thoughts and practices. The inquiry began with the researcher&#8217;s reflection on his personal experiences of teaching and learning in higher education, including key influences on his thoughts about teaching and teaching practices. This prompted an interrogation of the literature, which revealed that while a range of influences had been identified in relation to university teaching at macro, meso, micro and personal levels, there were limitations in findings concerning teachers&#8217; inner experience of and response to these influences, which provided a sound rationale for the conduct of this study. The researcher remained open to various theoretical positions as evident in literature. The study design presents a raison d&#8217;&#234;tre for a phased theoretical assumption to an alternative perspective of understanding and theorising the phenomena. Two different theoretical lenses are adopted. Firstly, epistemological constructivism and theoretical interpretivism are advanced as a suitable philosophical framework for the prosecution of the study that offers a methodological rationale for a qualitative investigation; grounded theory and a case study approach are applied in interpretative analysis. Second, ontological realism and epistemological relativism are imported in gaining insights from the perspectives of personal and social identities, human agency and structure as embedded in the data. The data gathering involved semi-structured interview, stimulated recall, and document analysis. Some data were collected from the participants&#8217; publications, conference presentations, and masters or doctoral theses. The data highlight a complex array of influences perceived and experienced by teachers in relation to their teaching ideas and practices. It identifies the significance of personal life experiences, both historical and ongoing, that influence teachers. It also reveals the range of contextual or structural influences that interact with these personal influences to affect teachers&#8217; thoughts about education, conceptions of teaching, and approaches to teaching and classroom practice. For each participant, these influential factors obviously play out in both complex and idiosyncratic ways with one another to exercise various degrees of influence on teaching thoughts and action at different points in teachers&#8217; lives. Data demonstrate the significance of teachers&#8217; perceptions of personal agency and structural power as an important mediator of their internal conversations about influences and their actual responses to them. Although the focus of the study concerned the various sources of influences on individual teachers at different levels, how they interacted with each other and how teachers inwardly experienced and made responses, what emerged has wider implications for teaching and learning in higher education, teacher development initiatives, academic leaders and managers and for other university teachers. The study provides a more holistic way of looking at influences on university teaching and opens up new research possibilities. The inclusion perspective of social critical theory is seen as a potent means to add fresh insights into the dialectical nature of teachers&#8217; agential power and contextual influences, echoing an emerging trend in the research on influence in higher education.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">influence</field><field name="subject">perception</field><field name="subject">experience</field><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="subject">university</field><field name="subject">teacher</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/939</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Airway smooth muscle dynamics</field><field name="creator">IJpma, Gijs</field><field name="description">The current study aims to investigate the relative contributions of each of the processes that govern airway smooth muscle mechanical behaviour. Studies have shown that breathing dynamics have a substantial effect on airway constriction in healthy and diseased subjects, yet little is known about the dynamic response of the main instigator of airway constriction, Airway Smooth Muscle (ASM). In this work several models are developed to further the understanding of ASM dynamics, particularly the roles and interactions of the three dominant processes in the muscle: contractile dynamics, length adaptation and passive dynamics. Three individual models have been developed, each describing a distinct process or structure within the muscle. The first is a contractile model which describes the contractile process and the influence of external excitation on contractile behaviour. The second model incorporates the contractile model to describe length adaptation, which includes the reorganisation and polymerisation of contractile elements in response to length changes. The third model describes the passive behaviour of the muscle, which entails the mechanical behaviour of all non-contractile components and processes. As little data on the passive dynamics of the muscle was available in the literature, a number of experiments were conducted to investigate relaxed ASM dynamics. The experimental data and mathematical modelling showed that passive dynamics plays not only a dominant role in relaxed ASM, but contributes considerably to the dynamics of contracted muscle as well. A novel theory of sequential multiplication in passive ASM is proposed and implemented in a mathematical model. Experiments and literature validated the model simulations. Further integration of the models and improved force control modelling of length adaptation is proposed for future study. It is likely that the coupling of the models presented here with models describing other airway wall components will provide a more complete picture of airway dynamics, which will be invaluable for understanding respiratory disease.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Airway smooth muscle</field><field name="subject">Mathematical modelling</field><field name="subject">Biomedical engineering</field><field name="subject">Power law relaxation</field><field name="subject">Tissue rheology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/941</field></doc><doc><field name="title">As the bamboo sings</field><field name="creator">Wong, Liu Shueng</field><field name="description">The research question considers the possibility that culture and identity impedes Chinese New Zealanders from writing fiction about their own culture, and considers a Chinese New Zealand history as interpreted from a Chinese perspective.

The creative work is a collection of ten stories linked thematically by an archaeological approach to character psychology, expression and action. Some of the stories also explore the influence of popular culture and cultural archetypes on the characters. Important contemporary influences in terms of both content and style have been the short stories, Wheat by Tracy Slaughter (2004), Walking to Laetoli by James George (2004) and Aquifier by Tim Winton (2004). The introduction of the exegesis outlines my interests in the modern &#8216;slice of life&#8217; story, in the conflict and tensions that occur between emotional and chronological time, and in Charles May&#8217;s assertion that short stories, through their use of metaphor, are a vehicle for exploring mythological perception. The theorists who most influenced my research and creative writing are then highlighted and their contribution to my understanding of narrative technique is discussed. Four main narrative techniques are emphasised, and illustrated with reference to particular stories from the collection. The techniques discussed are all related to the fundamental craft issue of show don&#8217;t tell. Finally the exegesis touches on the difficulty a writer has in being an objective reader of their own work.

In the last two decades, Internet and digital technologies have rapidly transformed the media and reshaped how news is gathered and disseminated, and re-defined audiences and their role in the media. Before the Internet, news dissemination was scheduled and periodic, for example the 6pm television bulletin or weekly newspaper. Today news is now global and published in 24/7 round the clock news cycles. At this time, there were clear demarcations between radio, television and newspapers, which were all separate entities. These demarcations have largely fallen away as all media have migrated online to publish on the same platform, using the same elements such as text, audio and video. Increasingly, television is migrating online to the degree that forecasts predict that online television will eclipse traditional TV as we now know it, just as much as online newspapers have eclipsed traditional newspapers. This debate is widely contested In pre-Internet days, the media had distinct demarcations between the media owners, news gatherers (and production people), like journalists, and the audience. These demarcations are blurring as audiences increasingly participate in the media resulting in the emergence of a new breed of journalists; the citizen journalist. This is the most popular term used to describe these new journalists. The dynamic nature of the online platform and functionalities like Web 2.0 made it possible for anyone to publish themselves online, on a blog, on social networking sites or to set up their own website, at very little or no cost. This has spurred a lot of creativity, and the wider public has created vast amounts of content such as video, audio and text and submitted or published them online. Consequently, content creation is no longer the preserve and domain of the media and journalists; the ubiquitous nature of the Internet and the availability of other enabling technologies: inexpensive digital technologies like video cameras, digital cameras and recorders means that anyone with access can now create content and disseminate it. Debates in many parts of the world have suggested that these abilities are catalysts that could spur the public into contributing news and video content of breaking news to the media and help keep the 24/7 round the clock news cycle current. After all, some online social networking sites have already demonstrated that citizens possess the skills to produce and publish video content. At a time when the media is facing financial pressure due to reduced advertising revenues, caused in part by the economic crisis and by the shift to the online platform, there are suggestions that citizens could help newsroom budgets by contributing material. It is against this background of rapid online migration by the media, and the emergence of this new breed of news gatherers, that this research on the Open Newsroom is set. The research topic is not new; a body of research about online migration of the media and the new news ecosystem exists in many other countries. In New Zealand however, this is still an emerging area of for research. This research monitored news bulletins on New Zealand&#8217;s two main television news channels, 3 News on TV3 and One News on Television New Zealand for 12 months from early 2008 to late 2009. The idea was to gauge and analyse the amount of content submitted by citizen journalists. The research also looked at a case study which illustrated the potential dangers of using news content submitted by citizen journalists. The research sought the professional opinions of a wide range of decision makers and influential people from the New Zealand media such as editors, journalists and publishers and those involved in the training of journalists in New Zealand. Using a Mini-DV video camera and a digital audio recorder, the researcher filmed and recorded interviewees and edited video clips of the interviews which were then published in the media gallery on the website www.theopennewsroom.com. The interviews sought to find out and discuss the online migration by the media, the new news ecosystem, the public&#8217;s participation in the media and the benefits and disadvantages of citizen journalism. To put the research into perspective, the website also carries some research articles and literature reviews on the media. The research findings from the interviews with New Zealand media professionals who participated in the study match trends happening in many countries. While most value the potential benefits of citizen journalists in the news process, some strongly expressed a great deal of skepticism and suspicion regarding news contribution from nontraditional journalism sources. In general, the research offered a series of insights into modern media rather than clear-cut answers</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">broadcasting and online migration</field><field name="subject">online media</field><field name="subject">citizen journalism</field><field name="subject">online television</field><field name="subject">IPTV</field><field name="subject">gatekeeping</field><field name="subject">news ecosystem</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/940</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Professional service relationships in chronic illness: the client's perspective</field><field name="creator">Mandlik, Milind Anil</field><field name="description">The relationship between professional service providers and their clients is of great importance to many service industries including educational, financial, consulting and healthcare services. The aim of this research enquiry is to identify, generate and describe a theoretical explanation of how a client engages in and manages their relationship with their health professional over a period of time. Fifteen participants living with chronic medical conditions were interviewed over a period of four months with data collected via unstructured in-depth interview sessions, and analysed using thematic analysis. The analysis reveals three major themes, nature of relationship, degree of control and service satisfaction. Of central concern is the longevity of the relationship between the healthcare client and his/her service provider. If the service provider is willing to share their authority and relinquish some of the control to the client, the client feels empowered. The client is then willing to provide information and effort to co-create effective service episodes. This sharing of authority enables the client to have better control on their service consumption. The sharing of authority also has an impact on the client&#8217;s propensity to remain engaged with their service provider. The findings of this study have implications for our knowledge and understanding of professional service delivery and how it differs from the delivery of consumer services. The study clearly indicates a shift in the role of a client as an empowered entity who wants to be part of, not just the service consumption, but service production as well. The key lessons from this study may inform other types of services including financial, educational and consulting services.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Professional services</field><field name="subject">Relationship marketing</field><field name="subject">Service quality</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/942</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comrades or competition? : union relations with Aboriginal workers in the South Australian and Northern Territory pastoral industries, 1878-1957</field><field name="creator">Elton, Judith</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to understand the historical factors that contributed to Aboriginal workers being included in pastoral industry unions as comrades, or treated as competitors with white unionists for jobs and income.

However, Aboriginal people would not be invited to run this service themselves, nor would it be used to 'maintain' Aboriginal cultural traditions. Rather, these new facilities would deliver programs that 'informed' Aboriginals about 'plans for their future advancement'. By 1985, the position had changed dramatically. The government was now funding 'Aboriginal-controlled' media organisations throughout the country 'to restore and rebuild' Aboriginal 'cultural identity'. It was also underwriting the launch of an Aboriginal-owned commercial satellite service covering a third of the Australian continent. In this thesis, I have attempted to understand the policies that led to this remarkable change in government thinking. In undertaking this work, I have not attempted to construct a 'resistant' Aboriginal 'voice', positioned against 'the media establishment' and the state to explain these transformations in Aboriginal policy. Although such a voice routinely appears in the literature on Aboriginal broadcasting, I argue that such an approach simply replicates the rhetoric surrounding the state's own policies of 'Aboriginal self-determination' and, more problematically, masks the complex operations of government itself. It also assumes the pre-discursive existence of a particular kind of Aboriginal agency, without considering the specific conditions that gave rise to it. In this study, I have sought to demonstrate how this agency was largely constituted through the policies of Aboriginal self-determination. I argue that under these policies, the state would no longer act on Aboriginals as it had in the past. Rather, Aboriginals would be invited to act on themselves in managing programs proffered by the state. Through these means, the Aboriginal 'self' became an indispensable element in the operations of the government. However, since the Aboriginal self would be expected to carry out the work of the state, it also became the object of intense governmental scrutiny. Here, I show how a multiplicity of governmental technologies emerged throughout the 1970's that served to regulate, channel and enhance Aboriginal subjectivity in accordance with a number of governmental ends. In undertaking this task, I have focused primarily on the development of the 'incorporated Aboriginal association'. I will argue that such bodies not only allowed Aboriginal people a degree of 'self-management', but also provided the state with an institutional framework through which it could constitute both a competent and verifiable Aboriginal agency. The Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association, CAAMA, was one of numerous bodies established under these governmental technologies. The development of this complex organisation will serve as the main case study in this thesis. In taking this analytical approach, I have adopted one of Michel Foucault's primary objectives which is to examine the ways in which the human subject is constituted through relations of power, and attempted to respond to the following set of queries Foucault poses: How was the subject established, at different moments and in different institutional contexts, as a possible, desirable, or even indispensable object of knowledge? How were the experiences that one may have of oneself and the knowledge that one forms of oneself organised according to certain schemes? How were these schemes defined, valorised, recommended, imposed?

High rate codes are necessary for applications which require high bandwidth efficiency, like high data rate communication systems and magnet recording systems. Convolutional (rate k/n) codes, used as component codes for turbo codes, are preferred for their regular trellis structure and the resulting ease in decoding. However, the branch complexity of the (primal) code trellis increases exponentially with k for k/(k+1) codes, making decoding on the code trellis quickly impractical with increasing code rate. 'Puncturing' is the method traditionally used for generating high rate codes, which keeps the decoding complexity nearly the same for a wide range of code rates, since the same ?mother? code decoder is used at the receiver, while only the puncturing and depuncturing pattern is altered for changes in code rate. However, 'puncturing' puts a constraint in the search for the best possible high rate code, thereby resulting in a performance penalty, particularly at high SNRs.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coding theory</field><field name="subject">Iterative decoders</field><field name="subject">Convolutional codes</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:37034</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A retrospective analysis of marketing strategy and innovation management in the Thai export manufacturing industry</field><field name="creator">Panich, Tanompong Best</field><field name="description">The objectives of this research project are threefold: (1) to identify the key marketing innovation factors which drive successful export marketing strategy in Thai manufacturing companies, (2) to test the proposed model 'The Full Model of Export Performance' on Thai export manufacturing companies, and (3) to suggest recommendations to Thai export manufacturing companies in order to improve their export performance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marketing</field><field name="subject">Management</field><field name="subject">Export manufacturing industry</field><field name="subject">Export trading companies</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:37039</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The causes and level of distribution channel conflict of China telecommunication industry</field><field name="creator">Lu, Jinghai</field><field name="description">The differences between Chinese distribution channels and western distribition channels are neglected.

The Sunrise Dam mine is the largest gold deposit in the Archean Laverton Tectonic Zone of the Eastern Goldfields Province, Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia. A number of previous studies have established the geology, geochemistry and geochronology, but the nature of the gold mineralogy and distribution has remained poorly characterized. Mineralogical studies have established a paragenetic sequence consisting of five hydrothermal stages (D1, D2, D3, D4a and D4b) which are generally in accord with the major deformation events at Sunrise Dam gold deposit. The D4a stage was the dominant episode of Au deposition, followed, in importance by the D4b stage, which is characterized by more diverse ore mineralogy including base metal sulfides, sulfosalts, and telluride minerals. Based on EPMA results, native gold in D4a stage has higher purity, with a small range of Ag variations (fineness 923 ~ 977, average 945), than that of the D4b stage (fineness 596 ~ 983, average 899), in which fineness values decrease systematically in accord with mineral paragenesis, reflecting that gold deposition was from a progressively compositionally evolving hydrothermal fluid with respect to Au/Ag ratios. The occurrences of As-rich pyrites are restricted to steeply-dipping ore bodies, which are most likely structurally connected at various level by channel ways through which As-rich (D4a) hydrothermal fluid migrating upward. There is a systematic variation in composition of the tetrahedrite-group minerals ranging from Sb to As end-members with highly variable Zn:Fe ratios, which correlates with the later paragenetic stages (D3, D4a, and D4b) and mineral associations. The composition of the tetrahedrite-group minerals is useful as a petrogenetic indicator of the evolution of the hydrothermal mineralizing systems with time. A total of thirteen telluride mineral species, including two unnamed phases, were identified in the D4 veins. Among them nagy&#225;gite, the complex Pb-Sb-Au tellurosulfide is most abundant. The deposit is the second occurrence of this mineral in the Yilgarn Craton. Compositionally, nagy&#225;gite from Sunrise Dam conforms to ideal stoichiometry, with negligible As content and Au/(Au+Te) ratio of 0.325. The diverse mineralogy of the post-D4 veinlets relative to the host veins is attributed to small-scale reaction fronts established along zones of replacement. The presence of Au-Ag tellurides in D4 veins and the character of their breakdown products have implications for the gold recovery as well as for the genetic interpretation of the deposit. During the D4b stage, Au-richer telluride and Au-richer native gold mineralization formed earlier than Ag-(Au)-telluride and Ag-richer gold mineralization. Values of f(Te2) and f(S2) for the early telluride assemblages were determined at 300&#176;C to be -10.7 to -7.8 (log fTe2) and 11.4 to -8.6( log fS2 ). The Au content of arsenian pyrite and arsenopyrite from four mineralizing stages (D1, D3, D4a and D4b) was measured using in-situ LA-ICP-MS. The average Au concentration is 44.5 ppm in pyrite (n = 224) with maximum value of 3,067 ppm, and 1,483 ppm in arsenopyrite (n = 35) with maximum value of 5,767 ppm, which are the highest concentrations reported for the Yilgarn Craton. The concentrations of invisible Au in arsenian pyrite at Sunrise Dam varies with mineralizing events, mineral paragenesis, and textural type. Gold is strongly enriched in D4a stage pyrite (average 80.8 ppm) and to a lesser extent in D4b pyrite (average 16.8 ppm). Pyrite from D1 (average 3.55 ppm) and D3 (average 2.96 ppm) show much lower levels of Au enrichment. The presence of metallic Au below the Au solubility limit in the Sunrise Dam pyrite is interpreted as evidence of an epigenetic origin for Au mineralization. Small-scale remobilization during dissolution-reprecipitation (D4a) and recrystallization (post-D4b) processes resulted in the Au enrichment and the upgrading of Au during successive hydrothermal events in the deposit. The speciation of Au at Sunrise Dam and the exceptional size of the deposit are the result of multiple fluid flow and multiple Au-precipitating mechanisms over a single plumbing system.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mineralogy and Crystallography</field><field name="subject">Ore Deposit Petrology</field><field name="subject">Gold mines and mining</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:36670</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating the impact of information and communications technology for development (ICT4D) project</field><field name="creator">Ashraf, Mohammad Mahfuz</field><field name="description">Research in the multi-disciplinary domain of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and Development indicates there is potential for ICT to contribute to a nation's socio-economic, socio-technical and socio-cultural development.

Before e-learning is largely implemented in education system, it is important to assess the e-learning readiness of a society. However, previous research always focus on measuring the e-learning readiness of commercial organisations and tertiary institutions, leaving a huge research gap on the use and readiness of e-learning in primary and secondary schools. This thesis developed a model for identifying e-learning readiness levels of teachers in Hong Kong schools, with the aim of creating a general model which could be transferred to other countries which are less developed than Hong Kong, yet which all share common Asian cultures. This was a multi-stage research project, incorporating model building and empirical testing of a model based on the existing academic literature, through questionnaire surveys to both in-service and pre-service teachers triangulated by series of in-depth interviews.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ICT</field><field name="subject">Readiness</field><field name="subject">e-Learning</field><field name="subject">Information and Communication Technology</field><field name="subject">Change Management</field><field name="subject">Organisational Planning and Management</field><field name="subject">Educational Policy, Administration and Management</field><field name="subject">Educational Technology and Media</field><field name="subject">Education Studies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Teacher Education: Primary</field><field name="subject">Teacher Education: Secondary</field><field name="subject">e-Learning</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:36669</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A systems approach to contractor prequalification</field><field name="creator">Baroudi, Bassam</field><field name="description">Contractor prequalification systems have been the cause for much debate within government, industry and research circles.

New products should be delivered into market as soon as possible. On the other hand, customers also require new products having good reliability. Laboratory life testing is the traditional way to examine the reliability of products. Sample products should be tested till failures, which usually involve tremendous cost and time. Obviously, the reliability testing process extends the duration of 'design-to-market'. Cutting down the testing process can reduce the producing cycle properly. Currently, the accelerated life test (ALT) has been widely used in many companies as an alternative method. Although ALT reduces the cost of reliability testing through applying more severe environmental conditions than the normal ones on products, it is no longer sufficient as it does not describe the process of products' failure explicitly and it is still highly dependent on physical testing. Consequently, prediction models need to be developed for better understanding of the products' reliability.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">contact surface wear</field><field name="subject">automotive industries</field><field name="subject">Finite Element Analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/50735</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:37515</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Marketing indicators and performance in the defense electronic industry</field><field name="creator">Ben Ari, Benni</field><field name="description">First, the research reported in this thesis investigated the complex interplay of dynamic factors that comprise the business environment of the defense electronics industry (DEI) as a way of understanding the tactical marketing process.

They are mostly distributed in winter rainfall dominated areas such as those at Middleback Field Centre (MFC) in South Australia. They can be used potentially as an indicator of rangeland condition by estimating grazing pressure (trampling). Two BSC based indicators for rangeland condition assessment are species composition and cover. While there is strong agreement that BSC composition is a good indicator, there is less agreement that BSC cover alone is a good indicator. Although BSC have been included in previous remotely-sensed studies, their spectral characteristics, and hence their contributions to remotely-sensed spectral signatures, are not well known. Data collection methods were refined for suitable method selection, stratification and site characterization, and morphological/ functional group classification. Cover data of BSC were collected using a 100 m line-intercept method on the stratified land units and statistical analyses were based on the cover variance analyses. Spectra of BSC groups were collected and characterized for different remote sensing indices. Five grazing gradient models based on collected spectra were developed for the evaluation of BSC effect on remotely-sensed data. Both existing and newly developed remote sensing indices were examined for BSC detection. Sampling for cover of BSC in the field showed that there is indeed a detectable change with distance from water, suggesting that BSC cover can be used as an indicator of rangeland condition, provided that appropriate stratification of the study sites is carried out prior to sampling, and spectral differences in morphological and functional groups are taken into account. Spectral analysis of BSC components showed that different classes of organisms in the crusts have different spectral characteristics, and in particular, that the (commonly-used) perpendicular vegetation index (PD54) is not suitable for detecting BSC. On the other hand, ground-level spectral modelling showed that the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Soil Stability Index (SSI) did show a distinguishable contribution from BSC. A procedure for detecting cover of BSC was developed for image taken during the period after an effective rain, in contrast to the normal practice of selecting images of dry surfaces for interpretation. The most suitable intervals appears to be 2-4 days after rain in late autumn, winter and early spring. Of the existing indices, the SSI is the best for estimating cover of BSC from Landsat images. However, eight new indices, specifically designed for detection of BSC were developed during the cource of this work. The best results were obtained for indices using using the middle-infrared bands. These results are promising for application to rangeland monitoring and suggest that BSC cover is an important indicator of rangeland condition if appropriate stratification, classification and data-collection methods are used. The effects of BSC cover on a remotely-sensed method are considerable, and thus they can not be neglected during image interpretation. There are different phenological patterns for BSC, annual and perennial elements, thus there is the possibility for the selection of imagery based on each phenological stage to detect these elements. Application of certain indices such as the PD54 may create mis-estimation of land covers. Although some of the existing and newly developed indices had significant results for BSC cover estimation, there is a requirement for a standalone remotely-sensed method to conclude the best index.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Landscape Ecology</field><field name="subject">Ecology and Evolution not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Image Processing</field><field name="subject">Simulation and Modelling</field><field name="subject">Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing</field><field name="subject">rangeland monitoring</field><field name="subject">biological soil crusts</field><field name="subject">indices</field><field name="subject">remotely sensed methods</field><field name="subject">Terrestrial Ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:37800</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Children's literacy development in the context of their preschool pedagogies in selected communities in India: a case study</field><field name="creator">Gokhale, Neelima</field><field name="description">This multiple case study investigated children's literacy development in the context of current pedagogical practices of their preschools in three selected communities in India.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Education Studies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">early literacy development</field><field name="subject">preschool education</field><field name="subject">social and cultural context</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:38134</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Craft as Escape: Women and the Domestic</field><field name="creator">Farrant, Lesa</field><field name="description">The focus of this thesis is an examination of domestic handicrafts and the significance of these to Australian women's lives. The topic focuses on how the making of simple and ordinary handicrafts provides women with an escape from the domestic demands of day to day life. This thesis incorporating a body of ceramic artefacts and written exegesis is the result of an exploration of comfort and safety found in handicrafts and clay. In addition, the concepts of repetition and extraordinary ordinariness have been investigated. Exploration of this topic has required an examination of handicraft techniques, prompting me to confront and consider my own domestic situation and consider my own approach to and relationship with clay. For the final series of artworks in response to the research I have drawn inspiration from historical women's handicrafts techniques and made reference to these within the ceramic artefacts presented. Research into the area of handicraft as escape has prompted exploration into works by artists not only in the field of ceramics but those working with other media and therefore enriching my response to the topic. My research has provoked me to translate and transform women's craft skills to create a framework for my own works in clay in addition to establishing a context for my work within the field of contemporary ceramics and more broadly within contemporary visual arts. Among the results of the project has been the development of a new approach to the medium of clay incorporating innovative techniques, as well as a greater conceptual framework within my own ceramics practice.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Visual Arts and Crafts not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Ceramics</field><field name="subject">women's craft</field><field name="subject">domestic handicrafts</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:39152</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Defining information: the site of struggle</field><field name="creator">Myburgh, Susan</field><field name="description">The contemporary information context is paradoxically antipathetic to the traditional information professions, and there are indications that, in order to survive, they will need to undergo radical transformation. This would require a re-conceptualisation of the "objects" of their knowledge domain, the entities and phenomena which comprise it, and the relationships between these entities (with particular reference to the concept of "information" itself). The term "information" is used in a multitude of contexts in the so called "Information Society", and this overuse has undermined the disciplinary and professional position of the information professions: the site of information work is contested. Furthermore, the changing context of the Information Society has challenged and diminished the essential task of the information professions: to deal with society's information problems and needs, as distinguished from the provision of information and communication technologies. In addition, access to information itself is contested as it is increasingly mediated by technology. The aim of this work is to develop a conceptual model by stabilising the defining concepts and constructs of information work, so that the social objectives and praxis of the field are elucidated and supported.

It motivates selective disclosure and supports self-determination. People have distinct and varied perceptions of their privacy which change over time and, in the context of information technologies, they maintain privacy by controlling information about themselves. If a person considers the type and amount of information known about them to be inappropriate then their privacy is at risk. Many innovative and advantageous approaches to maximizing data utility have emerged in recent years. However, in many cases the support of privacy is compromised and, consequently, diverse approaches to protecting privacy have been enacted by various governments and regulatory bodies. These legal and practical considerations motivate the development of a privacy-enhancing architecture for databases. Examination of the literature and related technologies confirms the research opportunity. Investigated via an exploratory research approach framed within the Software Engineering Research Methodology, the architecture is conceptualised, formalised and developed. Australia's National Privacy Principles (NPPs) contribute legal context and enable clarification of privacy requirements, which are based upon NPP 2: use and disclosure. The architecture is conceptualised as integrating legal privacy obligations with personal privacy preferences, leveraging them as constraints to regulate the use and disclosure of personal data. These constraints also facilitate an approach to tracking long-term changes in personal privacy preferences. The architecture is formalised through the design of use cases and rules expressed in predicate logic. It is further developed through the consideration of rules and the restrictions imposed by the implementation tools. PostgreSQL is used to implement the proof-of-concept prototype and testing is conducted. Finally, advantages and limitations are identified and discussed prior to the suggestion of options for further research. The architecture contributes proof-of-concept that widely-differing, changing privacy perceptions and legal requirements can be integrated in the design of a privacy-enhancing database architecture.

Creating a timetable can take several weeks, and so the process usually stops once the first feasible timetable has been found. It is suspected that this timetable is often far from optimal. Existing methods schedule track maintenance once the best train timetable has been determined and allow little or no adjustments to the timetable. This approach almost certainly produces suboptimal integrated solutions since the track maintenance schedule is developed with the imposition of the previously constructed train timetable. The research in this thesis considers operationally feasible methods to produce integrated train timetables and track maintenance schedules so that, when evaluated according to key performance criteria, the overall schedule is the best possible. This research was carried out as part of the Cooperative Research Centre for Railway Engineering and Technologies. We developed a method that uses a local search meta-heuristic called 'problem space search'. A fast dispatch heuristic repeatedly selects and moves a track possessor (train or maintenance task) through the network; this results in a single integrated schedule. This technique generates a collection of alternative feasible schedules by applying the dispatch heuristic to different sets of randomly perturbed data. The quality of the schedules is then evaluated. Thousands of feasible solutions can be found within minutes. We also formulated an integer programming model that selects a path for each train and maintenance task from a set of alternatives. If all possible paths are considered, then the best schedule found is guaranteed to be optimal. To reduce the size of the model, we explored a reduction technique called 'branch and price'. The method works on small example problems where paths are selected from a predetermined set, but the computation time and memory requirements mean that the method is not suitable for realistic problems. The main advantages of the problem space search method are generality and speed. We are able to model the operations of a variety of rail networks due to the representation of the problem. The generated schedules can be ranked with a user-defined objective measure. The speed at which we produce a range of feasible integrated schedules allows the method to be used in an operational setting, both to create schedules and to test different scenarios. A comparison with simulated current practice on a range of test data sets reveals improvements in total delay of up to 22%.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Operations Research</field><field name="subject">Heuristics</field><field name="subject">Integer programming</field><field name="subject">Train timetabling</field><field name="subject">Railway track maintenance scheduling</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/50708</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:37507</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Church and school as community: an ecclesiological study of the relationship between the Adelaide Catholic Archdiocese and its secondary schools</field><field name="creator">Battams, Craig</field><field name="description">This thesis is an applied ecclesiological study of the relationship between the Adelaide Catholic Church and its secondary schools. The specific focus is on the interplay between theological confession and historical reality. The theological confession with which I have been concerned is the understanding that the church is a community. The Archdiocese of Adelaide has been described as a community of people called into mission in and for the world. Catholic schools have also been regularly described as communities that exist within the wider church community. This study has examined how and to what extent this theological confession has informed and been informed by the contemporary historical reality of Adelaide's Catholic secondary schools and their relationship with the local church.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">South Australia</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Catholic schools</field><field name="subject">Catholic Church</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/58168</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:38672</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Primary health care: knowledge development and application in Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Davy, Carol</field><field name="description">Research into the use of information by health care professionals has generally been conducted in countries dominated by the biomedical model. In these contexts, illness is considered to have a scientifically identifiable physical cause, and treatment practices within the formal health care sector are prescribed and managed in accordance with this definition. Yet there are also contexts where other belief systems inform and guide the way that people think about their health. In comparison to the biomedical model, these contexts have contributed very little to our understanding of how health professionals develop their knowledge. This research investigates how primary health care workers (PHCWs) in one such context, Papua New Guinea (PNG), develop their knowledge about the health services they provide. In order to discover and understand the differing views of these PHCWs, 69 semi-structured interviews were conducted in three culturally and geographically diverse regions of PNG. In explaining the diagnostic and treatment practices they use, these participants provided insights into not only how PHCWs engage with information but also how it informs their professional practice. These data were analysed, interpreted and discussed using a framework consisting of four, primary but interconnecting aspects: the context in which information was provided, the interactions with the sources of information, the processes by which information was understood, and the outcomes realized as a result of the information being used. Findings indicated that the majority of participants in this study acknowledged, if not incorporated, information pertaining to biomedicine, Christianity and Indigenous belief systems into their diagnostic and treatment practices. Even when these belief systems clearly contradicted each other, PHCWs did not in general feel the need to make a conscious choice between them. From their comments it would appear that four factors contributed to this ability to incorporate diverse and often conflicting ideas into the way that patients were cared for. First, all of the belief systems were considered legitimate by at least one group of people connected to the community in which the PHCW worked. Second, although varying in degrees of availability and accessibility, members of these groups were able to disseminate information pertaining to the belief system they supported. Third, the PHCW had no particular affiliation with any one of these groups but instead regularly interacted with a range of different people. Lastly, the PHCW worked in situations where health practices were not generally well supervised by their employers and therefore they were relatively free to choose between various diagnostic and treatment practices. The qualitative interpretive approach adopted in this thesis contributes to the field of human information behavior by affirming that conflict is in the eye of the beholder. When a number of belief systems coexist and all are considered legitimate, information about them is freely available, and the recipients actions are neither constrained by their own dogma, nor imposed upon by others, individuals may quite comfortably embrace diverse beliefs. These findings may also contribute to a better understanding of health management practices in developing countries by suggesting that health professionals are not merely personifications of a biomedical model. Instead, the study demonstrates that multiple belief systems can be combined by PHCWs, and that in turn this benefits the formal health care sector through increased treatment options that are both appropriate and effective in such circumstances.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Primary Health Care</field><field name="subject">Health and Community Services</field><field name="subject">Studies in Human Society not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Sociology not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Indigenous Health</field><field name="subject">Development</field><field name="subject">Belief Systems</field><field name="subject">Papua New Guinea</field><field name="subject">Primary Health Care</field><field name="subject">Health Management</field><field name="subject">Information Behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:38312</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Total quality management for small and medium sized enterprises in Thailand : critical success factors and implementation framework</field><field name="creator">Akkarasrisawad, Decha</field><field name="description">Portfolio includes: paper 1.

It questions what it means to live and die, yet provides no clear-cut answers about death or dying, life or living. This thesis explores some of the ways suicide has been understood and represented, to demonstrate that knowing suicide is dependent not only on what suicide means, but also on how meanings of suicide become part of knowledge. Knowing suicide is not a matter of responding to it as self-evident, transparent, neutral and obvious, but rather is implicated in social processes and norms central to how knowledge gains intelligibility. Guided by poststructuralist, postmodernist, feminist and postfeminist philosophies, the thesis takes up gender and gendering as its central focus, to interrogate how knowledge about suicide becomes knowledge. Critically examining a wide variety of textual sources, it argues that suicide is principally rendered as a masculine, and even a masculinist, practice. Knowing suicide today is anchored in suicidology - the study of suicide - and maintained by institutional sites of practice including sociology, law, medicine, psy-knowledge and newsprint media, each of which is analysed here. Suicide as masculine and masculinist practice is invoked through multiple, often-contradictory and inextricably linked readings of gender, even while claiming homogeneity. Its gendered foundations can however be made to appear gender-neutral, even when actually gender-saturated. The twin gender movements of neutrality and repleteness are in fact crucial to the knowing of suicide. The thesis establishes that knowing suicide can never occur outside discourse. Even more importantly, how suicide enters discourse cannot be thought outside gender. The body matters to the production of deeply problematic understandings of agency, intent and violence, on which the production of suicide as masculine and masculinist depends. It becomes clear that such dependence rests not only on gender, but also on race and sexuality, as conditions of its knowing. The thesis suggests that further attention be given to the production and maintenance of highly reductive and limiting homogenous truth claims in suicide - truth claims that validate and privilege some interpretations of suicide, at the expense of rendering others less legitimate and serious. If the processes and practices of interpreting suicide become a site of permanent debate, they are more likely to challenge the ways in which masculinist ways of knowing render, and limit, the intelligibility of suicide.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gendering</field><field name="subject">suicidology</field><field name="subject">knowledge</field><field name="subject">Indigenous Health</field><field name="subject">Social Theory</field><field name="subject">History and Philosophy of Medicine</field><field name="subject">Gender Specific Studies</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Studies</field><field name="subject">Communication and Media Studies</field><field name="subject">Culture, Gender, Sexuality</field><field name="subject">Cultural Theory</field><field name="subject">Epistemology</field><field name="subject">Social Philosophy</field><field name="subject">Philosophy not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Mental Health</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">suicide</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/48839</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:35965</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Speaking from experience: the work of consumer and carer advocates in educating mental health professionals</field><field name="creator">Loughhead, Mark</field><field name="description">This ethnographic study explores the teaching role of activists and community advocates who have become involved in the education and preparation of mental health professionals. Placed in the transcultural mental health context, the study aims to identify central features of the ?teaching role? of consumer and carer advocates as they have become employed via participatory strategies and employment scenarios within mainstream teaching programs and transcultural mental health centres. The central theme of the study is how consumer and carer advocates teach via the notion of lived experience, a key expression of recent workforce development policy in Australian mental health. The research outcomes from this focus indicate that the teaching work of advocates in contributing authoritative knowledge of self and others is influenced by many factors intrinsic to their performed representative role, rather than exclusively by their personal experience as a consumer or carer, as the policy of lived experience would suggest. I argue that the requirements of teaching as defined by the expectations of employing organisations and the clinical audience, and by traditions in representative advocacy and professional education all shape the way in which advocates build and express their knowledge in educational work.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">consumer</field><field name="subject">Psychiatry</field><field name="subject">Mental Health Nursing</field><field name="subject">Mental Health</field><field name="subject">Primary Health Care</field><field name="subject">multiculturalism</field><field name="subject">ethnography</field><field name="subject">mental health</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/48858</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:35972</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Retrofitting of angle legs of transmission towers to increase load capacity</field><field name="creator">Tongkasame, Chirawat</field><field name="description">The ability of a retrofitting method that bolted additional angle members in parallel to existing transmission tower legs to increase their load capacity was examined, using both experimental work and complex finite element modelling.

Computers, notebooks, networks, mobile phones, digital cameras and embedded devices are all readily available and it is difficult to imagine a person that does not own at least some of these. However, with this rise in the use of electronics, comes its potential misuse. Electronic devices have transformed how existing crimes may occur, and also have allowed for several new forms of illegal activity. However, given the global nature of the Internet, such crimes may take place over multiple jurisdictions and countries. Where the investigation into computer-based crime occurs between two or more countries, there is a need for the two teams to understand the legal and cultural differences between them. Whilst the legal differences are written, interpreted and can be made explicit, there is less knowledge on the cultural differences between two countries, working in an emerging scientific field. Literature not only shows that the applications of science are affected by culture, but also demonstrates that computer forensics is a subject within the field of science. This research seeks to answer the question: Does Culture have impacts on Applications of Computer Forensics? In order to seek the answer of this problem, at least two countries with different cultural backgrounds and customs will be examined. Specifically, this work will discuss Australia and Taiwan, as these countries are examples of distinctive cultural variations found in the Asia Pacific. Culture is difficult to directly measure, and this work utilises the Delphi survey technique and case study interviews of computer forensic professionals and experts in the field in both Australia and Taiwan as its primary source of data collection. Analysis of this data provides both a view of the field at large, provided by the Delphi survey results and more detailed knowledge from specific experts gathered from the interviews. Specifically, the Delphi survey has 40 questions in five dimensions (Current Situation, Policy and Organization, Education, Law, and Personal Preference and Skill), and the interview is comprised of 13 questions, each asking for more depth than the Delphi can provide. The outcomes of this research directly compare the Australian and Taiwanese cultures as they apply to the field of computer forensics. As such, the most tangible outcome is a framework for Australian and Taiwanese law enforcement, forensic science community, and the court. The suggestions for cross-cultural, cross-border and collaborative digital forensic investigations can be provided based on the discoveries of this research. This thesis essentially helps the mutual understanding between Australian and Taiwanese computer forensic investigators. The understanding is able to improve the chances of success of future cooperation between Australia and Taiwan.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer forensics, culture</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/48864</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:35973</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reinforcement learning and convergence analysis with applications to agent-based systems</field><field name="creator">Leng, Jinsong</field><field name="description">Agent-based systems usually operate in real-time, stochastic and dynamic environments. Many theoretical and applied techniques have been applied to the investigation of agent architecture with respect to communication, cooperation, and learning, in order to provide a framework for implementing artificial intelligence and computing techniques. Intelligent agents are required to be able to adapt and learn in uncertain environments via communication and collaboration (in both competitive and cooperative situations). The ability of reasoning and learning is one fundamental feature for intelligent agents. Due to the inherent complexity, however, it is difficult to verify the properties of the complex and dynamic environments a priori. Since analytic techniques are inadequate for solving these problems, reinforcement learning (RL) has appeared as a popular approach by mapping states to actions, so as to maximise the long-term rewards. Computer simulation is needed to replicate an experiment for testing and verifying the efficiency of simulation-based optimisation techniques. In doing so, a simulation testbed called robot soccer is used to test the learning algorithms in the specified scenarios. This research involves the investigation of simulation-based optimisation techniques in agent-based systems. Firstly, a hybrid agent teaming framework is presented for investigating agent team architecture, learning abilities, and other specific behaviors. Secondly, the novel reinforcement learning algorithms to verify goal-oriented agents; competitive and cooperative learning abilities for decision-making are developed. In addition, the function approximation technique known as tile coding (TC), is used to avoid the state space growing exponentially with the curse of dimensionality. Thirdly, the underlying mechanism of eligibility traces is analysed in terms of on-policy algorithm and off-policy algorithm, accumulating traces and replacing traces. Fourthly, the "design of experiment" techniques, such as Simulated Annealing method and Response Surface methodology, are integrated with reinforcement learning techniques to enhance the performance. Fifthly, a methodology is proposed to find the optimal parameter values to improve convergence and efficiency of the learning algorithms. Finally, this thesis provides a serious full-fledged numerical analysis on the efficiency of various RL techniques.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Robocup Soccer</field><field name="subject">Reinforcement Learning</field><field name="subject">Convergence Analysis</field><field name="subject">Approximation Theory</field><field name="subject">Numerical Analysis</field><field name="subject">Optimisation</field><field name="subject">Systems Theory and Control</field><field name="subject">Expert Systems</field><field name="subject">Intelligent Robotics</field><field name="subject">Simulation and Modelling</field><field name="subject">Agent Architecture</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/48866</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:35974</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond the deferential worker: gendered, classed and rural meanings of work for production workers in a large wine producing organisation</field><field name="creator">Hoon, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">My central concern in this thesis is to extend understandings of how the social categories of rurality, gender and class are implicated in subjective meanings and the claiming of worth (associated with paid work) for a group of rural-based wine production workers. However, this concern does not reflect a relativist stance whereby all gendered, classed and rural experiences are read as equal but different, as this would deny symbolic and material inequalities. The core research question is: What gendered classed and rural subjective meanings do women and men production workers in the wine industry give their working selves? A key impetus for this study was my desire to represent working people's lives through a dynamic model of class, gender and rurality that overcomes the limitations of analyses which portray the lives of people, who have limited access to dominant symbolic discourses and processes, solely through the lens of deficit models of class and gender (Savage 2000, 2005; Skeggs 2004a). The overall methodological approach stressed the 'qualitative'. A feminist interpretation of constructivist grounded theory methodology framed the research (Charmaz 2000). Data generation involved two in-depth, face-to-face interviews with a sample of 16 workers (8 women and 8 men) based within the production function of a rural-based corporate wine organisation in South Australia. In the first interview I used a life history orientated approach and in the second I used a semi-structured interview schedule to examine the workers' current working lives, reflecting an understanding that rather than merely having experiences, 'subjects are constituted through experience' (Skeggs 1997). Interpretative analysis (using NUDIST) of the data re-orientated my engagement with established analyses of rurality, gender and class in order to build new, empirically-driven understandings of how multiple social categories are implicated in lived experiences. Preliminary data analysis led me to engage with Bourdieu's (1984) key concept of economic, social and cultural capitals as an analytical tool to examine how rural, gendered and classed lived experiences gave meanings to these workers. I have also paid attention to Skeggs' (2004a) argument that contemporary 'class making' involves uneven value attribution, the conferring of use values on practices and goods, engagement with inscriptions of value (inscription of lack of value and contestation of this), and critique of 'undeserved' exchange-based capitals as well as unequal access to exchangeable capitals. Skeggs' theoretical contribution has been extended to gendered and rural processes to examine how workers claim worth (as a worker) through these as well as classed processes. An exploration of the workers' family and work-based trajectories (including family historical ties to the local wine region, educational experiences and working trajectories) demonstrates the multiple ways in which class, gender and rurality are involved in lived experiences. The data highlight the ongoing influences of accrual of capital values (both use and exchange) tied to family upbringing and working trajectories, while analysis of current meanings of work provides greater detail on how the workers engage with value attribution of capital values, claiming worth in their work through challenging 'undeserved' capital values of winemakers, managers and technical experts.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">qualitative</field><field name="subject">worth</field><field name="subject">use values</field><field name="subject">exchange values</field><field name="subject">Gender Specific Studies</field><field name="subject">Social Theory</field><field name="subject">class</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/48870</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:35976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supported residential facilities: supporting residents to stay or move on?</field><field name="creator">Clark, Alice</field><field name="description">Many Supported Residential Facility (SRF) residents express a desire to live in more independent accommodation, however relatively few achieve this. Two of the issues preventing this are a lack of housing alternatives and support. This study examines the relevant literature and legislation, to gather documentary evidence and demographic data about South Australian SRFs and their residents. This is augmented by interviews with five key informants, to discover what other factors inhibit SRF residents from moving on to alternative accommodation. Findings indicate that recovery and rehabilitation are inhibited in SRFs and that current standards are barely sustaining people. Data suggests that legislation has a negative impact on residents and service delivery. This research recommends that the South Australian Government take up its legislative and ministerial responsibility to SRFs and their residents as a matter of urgency, especially in relation to fire safety. Secondly, that there is a review of The Legislation to incorporate citizenship rights and individualised care. And lastly, that in the interim, funding tied to service agreements is made available to SRFs, so that they become a place to recover and not the end of the line.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human Rights</field><field name="subject">Social Policy</field><field name="subject">Social Policy and Planning</field><field name="subject">Public Policy</field><field name="subject">Care for Disabled</field><field name="subject">Residential Client Care</field><field name="subject">Housing</field><field name="subject">Disability</field><field name="subject">Mental Health</field><field name="subject">Citizenship</field><field name="subject">Supported Accommodation</field><field name="subject">Supported Residential Facility</field><field name="subject">Supported Residential Facility Act</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/48833</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:35963</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Horizontal and vertical integration of object oriented information systems behaviour</field><field name="creator">Grossmann, Georg</field><field name="description">Integration is one of the driving themes in database and applied computing research. Starting with the development of Federated Information Systems and passing over to Enterprise Application Integration, the integration of distributed systems receives a lot of attention with the development of Web services these days. Integration on an architecture independent level can be cast to the integration of autonomous object oriented systems which requires the integration of object structure and object behaviour. Past research has mainly addressed the structural aspects meaning the integration of class attributes and relations. This thesis is addressing the integration of object behaviour and proposes a structured, model-driven approach for the integration of business processes specifying software application behaviour. It consists of the identification of correspondences between business processes on different levels of abstraction and associates the correspondences with integration patterns that lead to a specific technical integration. One advantage of the approach is that correspondences and patterns are defined separately, which enhances the re-usability of patterns in different integration scenarios. Integration scenarios can be distinguished between horizontal and vertical integration, and within or across enterprise borders. Within an enterprise, horizontal integration consists of integrating systems on the same level of abstraction and vertical integration consists of integrating systems on different levels of abstractions, whereas across enterprise borders, horizontal integration consists of determining the most appropriate systems, from among a set of functionally equivalent ones, and vertical integration consists of defining an appropriate combination of systems to create a new one. So far, there exist no approach that attempts to support all integration scenarios within a framework. This thesis proposes an integration approach that is able to support all integration scenarios mentioned before. The approach is built on a meta-meta layer architecture and provides generic methods and techniques for the logical integration of object behaviour based on a domain independent framework. The thesis proposes two alternative outcomes of an integration. First one creates a new global behaviour that integrates local behaviour and can be supported by a service oriented architecture. Second alternative outcome are synchronisation points between business process, so-called inter-process dependencies, that can be supported by an event-driven architecture. The advantages and disadvantages of both are discussed in detail.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Meta modelling</field><field name="subject">Interorganisational Information Systems</field><field name="subject">Conceptual Modelling</field><field name="subject">Information Systems Development Methodologies</field><field name="subject">Behaviour-based integration</field><field name="subject">Business processes</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/48836</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:35964</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Bit of Give and Take: Older Volunteers' Sources of Value and Worth</field><field name="creator">Adams, Jennifer</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of older volunteers and their feelings of being valued and of worth within that role. The perceptions of older volunteers and their managers within three participating non-government organisations, government and organisational policy documents and relevant legislation and literature in the fields of ageing and volunteering provided data for the research. Changing political, economic and social conditions together with ageing of the Australian population have resulted in human services being increasingly contracted to non-government organisations. This in turn has resulted in more services than hitherto being delivered by volunteers many of whom are older people. Population ageing implies that there will be an increasing need for human services provision in the first half of the twenty first century. Whether there will be sufficient volunteers to maintain these services will depend at least in part on the responsiveness of organisations to their volunteer base and the effectiveness of their recruitment strategies. This research indicates that a sense of mastery over their circumstances is critical to volunteer satisfaction. Volunteers discussed their perceptions of maintaining control over their circumstances through the process of initiating volunteering arrangements and negotiating role changes in response to their changing health or abilities. Managers recognised the need to be responsive to the changing abilities of older volunteers and identified strategies for maintaining the volunteer contribution. Management style and in particular communication emerged as integral to volunteer satisfaction and an awareness of and responsiveness to differing motivators was important, particularly in relation to social networking and making a worthwhile contribution as a source of feeling valued.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">volunteering</field><field name="subject">self-esteem</field><field name="subject">Ship and Platform Hydrodynamics</field><field name="subject">Social Policy and Planning</field><field name="subject">Social Work not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Social and Cultural Anthropology</field><field name="subject">aging</field><field name="subject">ageing</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/48830</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:35962</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of perspective taking on anger experience and expression</field><field name="creator">Gerace, Adam</field><field name="description">The way in which we perceive and interpret the causes of situations is likely to have a profound influence on our subsequent behaviour. It has been well established that the experience of anger is likely to systematically influence the cognitive processing style and cognitive skills that the individual will use in understanding, and responding to, interpersonal situations. One important process that may be affected by the regular experience of intense anger (trait anger), is the dispositional propensity to attempt to understand the thoughts, feelings, and point of view of another person in an interpersonal interaction (i.e., perspective taking). A study was conducted to test this theoretical hypothesis. In addition, the study attempted to examine the influence of perspective taking on anger experience, control, and expression.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mental Health</field><field name="subject">Medical and Health Sciences not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Personality, Abilities and Assessment</field><field name="subject">Social and Community Psychology</field><field name="subject">Anger</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/48665</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:35839</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The place of physical planning solutions in the urban redevelopment process</field><field name="creator">Findlay, Michael</field><field name="description">This thesis presents evidence to support the main contention that the urban redevelopment process is limited in its ability to deliver better communities and that it needs to be seen as only part of a broader community-building process.

Moreover, recent research suggests that the detrimental effects of sleep loss are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the effects of alcohol intoxication. Despite this, sleepiness-related performance impairment has not been subject to the strict levels of regulatory intervention that govern alcohol consumption when driving and/or at work. It has been proposed that this failure to address the occupational, health and safety impact of sleep loss, and the subsequent lack of legislation to manage and control sleepiness in a manner commensurate with the associated statistical risks, may in part, reflect a failure to provide policy makers with a readily understood index of the relative risk associated with sleep loss. Therefore the aim of the studies in this thesis was to assess and quantify the effects of sleep loss on a range of measures, including neurobehavioural performance, sleepiness, and daytime sleep quality and quantity.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sleep disorders</field><field name="subject">Sleep deprivation</field><field name="subject">Sleep apnea syndromes</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/48685</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:35847</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managerial characteristics and business strategy as determinants of business performance as moderated by business environment of Chinese SMEs in the State of Sarawak, East Malaysia</field><field name="creator">Sung, Ching Ing</field><field name="description">This exploratory study investigates the combined effects on firm performance of Chinese SMEs in Sarawak due to the managerial characteristics of owners / managers and business strategy as moderated by business environment.

Viewers today not only have access to a prolific number of channels, but there are now specialist channels devoted to single genres such as sports, music, children's, news etc. This thesis investigates the effect these changes have had on television viewing behaviour.

Since most economic activities are under the control of Overseas Chinese, the study of the influence of Chinese Culture has become an important item in strategic management research. Despite the criticality of understanding the strategic decision processes of Chinese managers, very few empirical studies have addressed this gap. This research attempts to develop an integrative model that explains the causal relationships between Chinese culture, strategic decision making processes and organizational performance. The study uses the quantitative research design and structural equation analysis technique to develop and test the model. The major findings are two causal paths in the model, namely cognitive-speed path and social-political path. The cognitive-speed path suggests that the Chinese focus on the big picture and that the adoption of a holistic view, as well as drawing analogues from past experience and extensive network, will reduce the duration of the decision process. The social-political path shows that Chinese managers focus on the collective interest, strive to maintain harmony and save face; the managers also use a collaborative approach to handling conflict, thus reducing dysfunctional political behavior, while reinforcing the decision team's focus on common goals, factual data and fair processes. These two paths are found to have a positive relationship with organizational performance with the cognitive-speed path showing a stronger effect. The most significant contribution of this study is the establishment of a Chinese strategic decision making process model that can benefit both Western and Chinese organizations by adapting some of its implications. Future studies can enhance the model using longitudinal design with more detailed variables and larger sample size to study the effect of other contextual differences like ownership or age groups.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Management</field><field name="subject">Corporate culture</field><field name="subject">Business enterprises</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/49387</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:36423</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tragicomedy in the sociopolitical protest art of Yogyakarta</field><field name="creator">Wraith, Barrie Hamilton</field><field name="description">Sociopolitical artists in Yogyakarta have a long history of objection to governmental suppression in Indonesia.

In the years immediately following Suharto's forced resignation in 1998 artists more boldly showed criticism of both previous and present corruption, collusion and nepotism.

Determining the future of the disputed areas of northern Iraq is the main reason behind this Kurdish involvement and it is one of the two Kurdish objectives in Iraq. The other is the quest to establish an independent state of Kurdistan. The relations between the two objectives are particularly complicated, as are the Iraqi and Kurdish issues. On the one hand it is difficult to imagine that the Kurds will declare an independent state without Kirkuk, or if they do so it is unclear how that state could be economically viable. On the other hand, it is hard for the Kurds to convince others to help solve the sensitive issue of Kirkuk if they assert their claim for independence. In other words, control of Kirkuk and independence are inseparable elements of the Kurdish strategy, but the former will guarantee the success of a Kurdish state whereas asserting independence would jeopardise the control of Kirkuk if it was the Kurds declared strategy in the present situation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kurds</field><field name="subject">Iraq</field><field name="subject">Civil rights</field><field name="subject">Ethnic relations</field><field name="subject">Politics and government</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/49073</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:36162</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From head to hand and beyond : 'thought-image' drawing in sketchbooks</field><field name="creator">Hooper, Margaret J.</field><field name="description">Situated between embryonic ideas and 'finished' work are thought-image drawings, the tangible evidence of the exploratory thinking of artists.

The significance of rural landscape as cultural heritage has to do with how people perceive or value them. However, very little is known about the variability among cultures in the perception of such landscapes. Due to increasing threat by land and technological development, an understanding of their perception by people associated with them will aid in the formulation of strategies for rural landscape conservation and their integration into broad patterns of use. Thus, this study was aimed at understanding perceived landscape values held by communities of interest in Malaysia. Specifically, it focused on understanding how two different groups of stakeholders characterised landscape values. Using Q-Methodology it examined their socio-cultural construction of rural landscape and how those constructions defined their values and meanings, from individual and group viewpoints. A non-random sample of local residents from four villages in Kedah, a northern state in Peninsular Malaysia categorised for this purpose as insiders was compared with government servants, domestic and overseas tourists as outsiders. The respondents were shown photographs of landscape settings as representations of the rural landscape. They were asked to sort the photographs from most valued to least valued landscapes and asked to clarify their selection in a detailed interview.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Landscape protection</field><field name="subject">Malaysia</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/60894</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:38851</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relational market based assets (of a firm) and their role in innovation adoption</field><field name="creator">Belder, Marcus</field><field name="description">This thesis identifies the positive effect that relational Market Based Assets have on the adoption of innovation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New products</field><field name="subject">Product management</field><field name="subject">Marketing research</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:36825</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Action learning in engineering management : using financial data to optimise plant maintenance strategies</field><field name="creator">Hood, Shannon</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses learning in engineering management.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Engineering</field><field name="subject">Engineering economy</field><field name="subject">Engineering managemen</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:36823</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using the Theil index in marketing to analyse variation in wine consumption habits</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Damien</field><field name="description">Historically, data on wine consumption has been difficult to obtain.

The generalisation concerns the stability of individual's perceptual responses over time. While the accepted belief is that peoples' attitudes and brand beliefs are enduring and stable, in fact, on average, only about half of the people who give a response at one interview do so again at a second interview. This instability is in spite of the fact that, at an aggregate level, the results are steady across interviews (Castleberry, 1994; Dall'Olmo Riley, 1995). The empirical generalisation examined in this thesis states that the stability of a perceptual response (known as the repeat rate RR) is predictable, based on the initial proportion of respondents giving the response at the first interview (known as the response level RI). This has been noted in the Journal of Marketing Science as an important empirical generalisation with much scope for replication work (Ehrenberg, 1995).</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Consumer behavior</field><field name="subject">Human behavior</field><field name="subject">Perception</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:36818</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding consumers' repertoire sizes</field><field name="creator">Banelis, Melissa</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to develop a greater understanding of consumers' brand repertoires.

The first section, the introduction and literature review, also covers the aim and objectives of the thesis. The second section discusses the labour migration from the Philippines to the outside world. It then explores the push forces and pull factors for Filipino migration in terms of: (i) economic issues, including unemployment and unchecked population growth, fiscal deficit and public-sector debt, natural disaster and globalisation; (ii) political factors, including a weak and inefficient state, security problems, and laws and policies; and (iii) dynamics of marriage and family migration, personal choice, wage difference and level of skills. The third section discusses the Philippines Government's roles in promoting migration, in implementing policies to protect its Filipino migrants and in providing supports for 'overseas contract workers' (OCWs). The fourth part of the thesis explains the importance of the remittances that overseas Filipinos send back to their home country. A series of case studies is presented on the fifth chapter; these focus on Filipino professional migration to Australia and particularly the state of South Australia. The case studies provide a more in-depth understanding of the Filipino migrants' role and position in a foreign country.

The causes of TH are unclear, precluding optimal treatment or prevention at present. Stress is a well-documented correlate and trigger of TH activity, however the causal significance has not been experimentally demonstrated to date. Similarly, the mechanisms by which stress contributes to TH, if in fact it does, are not clearly understood. Findings of increased pain sensitivity in TH sufferers suggests TH pathophysiology may involve dysfunction in peripheral and/or central nervous system processing of pain. Studies on animals and healthy humans demonstrate that stress can increase pain sensitivity by affecting peripheral and central pain mechanisms proposed as dysfunctional in TH. It has therefore been proposed that stress may contribute to TH through aggravating already increased pain sensitivity in TH sufferers. However, this hypothesis has not been adequately examined in TH sufferers to date. Addressing the above issues, the present project conducted seven studies examining relationships between stress, pain sensitivity, and headache activity in TH sufferers. The aim was to test the hypothesis that stress contributes to TH by aggravating already increased pain sensitivity in TH sufferers. Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated increased general arousal and complex temporal relationships between general arousal and headache activity in the natural environment in Episodic TH (ETH) sufferers. In Study 3, experimentally induced stress of brief duration increased pressure pain sensitivity at the head in Chronic TH (CTH) sufferers more than in healthy controls. Study 4 found CTH sufferers to have increased levels of daily stress, increased pericranial muscle tenderness, and reduced pain thresholds, which were inter-related. Both daily stress and pain sensitivity were predictive of prospective daily headache activity. In Study 5, an experimental model demonstrated that stress-induced headache was associated with stress-induced increase in pericranial muscle tenderness and reduction in pressure pain thresholds at head and hand. Additionally, induced stress reduced pain tolerance and increased pain intensity ratings to cold pressor more in TH sufferers than in healthy controls (Study 7). Finally, TH sufferers were found to have abnormal temporal summation of pressure pain and impaired noxious inhibition of temporal summation compared to healthy controls, however neither temporal summation nor noxious inhibition of temporal summation were affected by induced stress (Study 6). Together, the results support the hypotheses: 1) Stress contributes to both ETH and CTH, and 2) Stress contributes to CTH through aggravating already increased pain sensitivity in CTH sufferers. Impaired pain inhibition and increased wind-up may be underlying abnormalities contributing to increased pain sensitivity in CTH sufferers.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Health, Clinical and Counselling Psychology</field><field name="subject">Biological Psychology (Neuropsychology, Psychopharmacology, Physiological Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Neurology and Neuromuscular Diseases</field><field name="subject">tension type headache</field><field name="subject">stress</field><field name="subject">pain sensitivity</field><field name="subject">muscle tenderness</field><field name="subject">mechanisms</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:39146</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Education for a just democracy: the role of ethical inquiry</field><field name="creator">Collins, Carol</field><field name="description">In this thesis it is argued that the fundamental goal of education is one of equipping students to think well, that is, to make decisions on the basis of arguments that are both logically cogent and ethically grounded. Moreover, the concern of the thesis is the role social and environmental education might play in fostering both the capability and the readiness to engage widely in such thinking. Drawing on relevant philosophical and psychological theory the study describes the development of an educational programme grounded in the procedures of ethical inquiry and taught via whole-class community of inquiry style discussions. The programme was trialled by way of a large scale, matched intervention study in South Australian upper primary classrooms. The findings from the research project indicate that participation in the programme produced significant gains in participants' logical and ethical reasoning and also that the programme fits within the constraints of prevailing educational structures.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Philosophy not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Teacher Education: Primary</field><field name="subject">Teacher Education: Higher Education</field><field name="subject">Curriculum Studies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">History and Philosophy of Education</field><field name="subject">Educational Psychology</field><field name="subject">Philosophy for Children</field><field name="subject">Ethical inquiry</field><field name="subject">Community of Inquiry</field><field name="subject">Social and Environmental Education</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/51285</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:37943</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of past experience on the process of perspective taking</field><field name="creator">Gerace, Adam</field><field name="description">Perspective taking, the main cognitive component of empathy, is considered within the psychological literature to be a significant part of human interaction. Despite extensive investigation into the outcomes of this construct, the process by which people take another's psychological point of view has received comparatively little attention. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate in three studies what the individual does when attempting to take the perspective of another person. The first study investigated the particular strategies which individuals use when engaging in perspective-taking behaviours. Dominant themes to emerge from this qualitative assessment of the perspective-taking process were the use of self- (e.g., switching places) and other-information (e.g., targets personal characteristics), of which the former appears to play the central role. Further elements of the perspective-taking process were also identified with the self-information theme. Of these, having experienced a situation similar to that of a target (similar past experience) was found to be a particularly strong aspect of the perspective-taking process and subsequently informed the rationale for the remaining two studies. In view of the findings from Study 1, the second study tested whether past experiences made it easier for participants to take the perspective of another person in a new, but similar situation and the extent to which other aspects, such as switching places with the target, made the perspective-taking process less effortful. Results revealed that similar past experience was the strongest predictor of the ease of the perspective-taking task. Moreover, the extent to which similar past experience increased ease of the perspective-taking process was moderated by the extent to which the participant reflected on that past experience. The final study in this thesis picked up the notion of reflection and examined whether increasing the extent to which an individual engages in self-reflection leads to a concomitant increase in the tendency to take another perspective and the ease with which this can be accomplished. After completion of an intervention program which had a strong focus on self-reflection and understanding of self, there was a noticeable trend for participants to improve on their capacity for self-reflection. The findings also revealed that individuals with a tendency to self-reflect in an insightful and non-ruminative manner demonstrated a similarly high level of general perspective-taking propensity and ease of perspective taking. The studies support the vital role of reflection on similar past experience to that of a target when engaging in perspective taking. This research underscores the importance of examining perspective taking as a process.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social perception</field><field name="subject">perspective taking</field><field name="subject">empathy</field><field name="subject">Social and Community Psychology</field><field name="subject">Personality, Abilities and Assessment</field><field name="subject">Learning, Memory, Cognition and Language</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:38313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Urban design quality, neighbourhood urban form and travel behaviour: case studies of four Adelaide suburbs</field><field name="creator">Soltani, Ali</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the results from a comparative study of travel patterns among residents of four suburban residential areas in metropolitan Adelaide.

They include both natural and synthetic steroid estrogens, together with a variety of estrogen mimicking chemicals such as 4-nonylphenol, bisphenol A and various pesticides. In vertebrates, estrogens play a fundamental role in reproduction, in somatic cell function, the regulation of calcium and water homeostasis. Exposure to xenoestrogens may therefore have unscheduled effects on these systems that can potentially compromise species survival. With the ever-increasing number of xenoestrogens identified and detected in the environment, together with the fact that they are seldom detected alone, there is a need to develop specific and sensitive biomarkers to detect estrogenic activity of chemicals in the environment when present alone and in mixtures. In this study, the effect of selected xenoestrogens was assessed using an in-vitro yeast estrogen screen (YES) both individually and in mixtures and in-vivo in a native fish species, the Murray rainbowfish (Melanotaenia fluviatilis).</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321004 Endocrinology</field><field name="subject">320504 Toxicology (incl.

Increasing use of medication, however, can lead to (potentially preventable) medication-related adverse events. Medication management offers a means of addressing such adverse events and pharmacists have an important role in this solution, especially in terms of reviews of patient medication. Improved availability and sharing of patient-related information are critical factors in medication management, so that providing access to this information becomes a major factor in effective medication reviews. Although clinical decision support tools can significantly assist doctors in accessing relevant point-of-care information for greater patient safety, it has proven difficult to ensure the availability and appropriate structure of patient-related information for such support tools. These information access and input problems are further exacerbated by a lack of existing research into suitable decision support solutions for pharmacists. This research project explored the suitability of an essential information model to support an electronic document solution to support clinical documentation and allow effective communication between pharmacists and doctors for medication reviews. The project investigated whether this approach could improve safety, quality and efficiency in the medication review process; as well as more generally identifying factors influencing development and uptake of document-based support tools in the Health sector. The project used a qualitative Design Research approach and iterated through three scenarios. The first, information-rich, hospital scenario developed an information model of essential medication management components, which underpinned the development of a digital document prototype implemented using XForms technology. In the second scenario, accredited pharmacists evaluated the digital document to enable refinement of the information model and its associated digital document for the broader community context. The third scenario involved field studies which evaluated the digital document (and thus the underlying information model) within the community, assessing its contribution to quality, safety and efficiency throughout the medication review process. The investigation identified a number of themes which guided design and development of the prototype; and which appeared likely to have a broader impact on successful uptake of decision support tools. Missing information proved to be a constant and serious problem for health professionals although, in this project, it also became a way of determining the value of an information element and thus its inclusion in the information model. Conversation played a significant role in the hospital environment to help supply pharmacists information needs. Information granularity, the language of health professionals; and their time constraints were major factors influencing design. Health professionals extensive use of their personal knowledge also suggested decision support tools in this sector should be systems for experts rather than expert systems, i.e. the decision support tool and its users personal knowledge should complement one another. The results of this proof-of-concept project suggest practice improvement in medication management is possible, with perceived improvements in safety, quality and efficiency of the medication management process. These benefits, however, now need to be affirmed in larger field studies. The contributions of this research are two-fold: firstly, it is possible to develop a model of essential medication-related information which is succinct, relevant and can be understood and shared by health professionals in conjunction with the individuals personal knowledge. Secondly, a document metaphor is a natural fit with health professionals for representing and communicating information. Expressing this metaphor as digital document overcomes the main problems of paper-based documents sharing and communication; and the dynamic properties of digital documents assist in decision-making.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280109 Decision Support and Group Support Systems</field><field name="subject">320501 Pharmaceutical Sciences and Pharmacy</field><field name="subject">280199 Information Systems not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">digital documents</field><field name="subject">decision support</field><field name="subject">medication management</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/34051</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:28398</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supporting strategic decisions for complex systems-of-systems: a syncretic approach</field><field name="creator">Staker, Roderick</field><field name="description">Complex Systems-of-Systems, which form the subject matter of the research presented here, may be considered to be systems that are constituted of several components, each of which could themself be regarded as being a complete system in its own right. These component systems are typically largely managed independently of one another. They each have their own intrinsic goals which they are capable of fulfilling autonomously. These goals are additional to any to which they might contribute as part of the overall System-of-Systems that is being investigated. Systems-of-Systems are epitomised by features such as the prevalence of complex webs of mutual interdependency amongst their component systems, the involvement of a broad diversity of stakeholders and the participation of a number of independent decision-makers, each of whom competes with the others for strictly limited resources. Furthermore, the components of Systems-of-Systems may often be found to be widely scattered across an extensive geographical region. Sometimes such systems may even span global distances. Complex Systems-of-Systems of such a nature would appear to be becoming ever more prevalent in the increasingly interconnected and ever shrinking world which is engendered, in particular, by the proliferation of modern information and communication technology. Systems-of-Systems may arise in both commercial and public sector contexts, hence commercial organisations and governments, alike, confront the daunting challenge of planning, establishing and maintaining novel systems of this type. However, it is to be anticipated that significant difficulties might be encountered in applying existing systems engineering methods, which were designed for dealing with far more monolithic types of system, to the treatment of Systems-of- Systems. Instead, the successful achievement of acceptable resolutions to the various Systems-of-Systems issues and conundrums with which the responsible planners can be expected to be confronted would appear to demand the application of sophisticated distributed decision aids, in order to alleviate the the intolerable burden which the decision-makers would otherwise be forced to endure. Such aids need to be able to take a genuinely fair and unbiased account of the interests of a multitude of stakeholders. At the same time, they must be able to satisfactorily accommodate the enforcement of a range of highly involved and intricate constraints upon the various alternative interventions which might potentially be contemplated. In order to underpin the development of decision aids of the kind demanded, it has been sought to establish some basic theoretical foundations for Systems-of-Systems. This body of theory has then been applied to the identification of the methods which might be most suitable for the treatment of Systems-of-Systems questions. Finally, some decision-support tools which are intended to facilitate the implementation of the methods that have been recommended have been described. Any attempt to dictate a single &#226;??best&#226;?? intervention to the decision-makers would generally be totally unacceptable. As a result, the objective which has been pursued has been to seek to filter out and identify a relatively sparing number of what would appear to be the most reasonable alternatives from some much more profuse range of possibilities. These may then be afforded more intensive scrutiny by the pertinent decision-makers.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dynamical Systems</field><field name="subject">Operations Research</field><field name="subject">Optimisation</field><field name="subject">Systems Theory and Control</field><field name="subject">Decision Support and Group Support Systems</field><field name="subject">Systems Theory</field><field name="subject">Other Artificial Intelligence</field><field name="subject">complex systems</field><field name="subject">systems-of-systems</field><field name="subject">systems theory</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/30414</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:28396</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of child rearing practices amongst a selected sample of Filipino, Cambodian and Sudanese families in South Australia: implications for child care service selection and program development</field><field name="creator">Dela Cerna, Carmencita</field><field name="description">This study investigated 15 child care centres to find out their responsiveness to the needs of families from non-Anglo backgrounds.

For example, travellers could be struck walking to/from or boarding/alighting a bus. At these locations, passengers become pedestrians and at some stage crossing busy arterial roads at the bus stop in areas or at objects of main attraction usually outside of pedestrian designated facilities such as signal controlled intersections, zebra and pelican crossings. Pedestrian exposure to risk or risk-taking occurs when people want to cross the road in front of the stopped bus, at the rear of the bus or between the buses, particularly where bus stops are located on two-way roads (i.e. within the mid-block of the road with side streets, at non-signalised cross-section). However, it is necessary to have a better understanding of the pedestrian road-crossing risk exposure (pedestrian crossing distraction, obscurity and behaviour) within bus stop zones so that it can be incorporated into new design, bus stop placement, and evaluation of traffic management schemes where bus stop locations will play an increasingly important role. A full range of possible incidental interactions are presented in a tabular model that looks at the most common interacting traffic movements within bus stop zones. The thesis focused on pedestrian safety, discusses theoretical foundations of bus stops, and determines the types of accident risks between bus travellers as pedestrians and motor vehicles within the zones of the bus stop. Thus, the objectives of this thesis can be summarized as follows: (I) - Classification of bus stops, particularly according to objects of main attraction (pedestrian-generating activities); (II) - Analysis of traffic movement and interactions as an accident/risk exposure in the zone of bus stops with respect to that structure; (III) - Categorizing traffic accident in the vicinity of bus stops, and to analyse the interactions (interacting movements) that occur within bus stop zones in order to discover the nature of problems; (IV) - Formulation of tabular (pedestrian traffic accident prediction) models/forms (based on traffic interactions that creating and causing possibilities of accident conflict) for practical statistical methods of those accidents related to bus stop, and; (V) - Safety aspects related to the micro-location of bus stops to assist in the micro-location design, operations of bus stop safety facilities and safer pedestrian crossing for access between the bus stop and nearby objects of attraction. The scope of this thesis focuses on the theoretical foundation of bus stop micro&#226;??location in areas of main attractions or at objects of main attraction, and traffic accident risk types as they occur between travellers as pedestrians and vehicle flow in the zone of the bus stop. The knowledge of possible interactions leads to the identification of potential conflict situations between motor vehicles and pedestrians. The problems discussed for each given conflict situation, has a great potential in increasing the knowledge needed to prevent accidents and minimise any pedestrian-vehicle conflict in this area and to aid in the development and planning of safer bus stops.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Transportation not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Civil Engineering not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Transport Engineering</field><field name="subject">Data Storage Representations</field><field name="subject">Simulation and Modelling</field><field name="subject">bus stops</field><field name="subject">pedestrian safety</field><field name="subject">traffic safety</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/28389</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:28389</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The spiral travelled: an exegesis with accompanying novel, The diary of Jeremy Prior</field><field name="creator">Robins, Allan</field><field name="description">The thesis focuses on representations of Indigeneity by non-Indigenous writers and in particular the author's practice in the writing of a children's novel, in which the relationship between non-Indigenous and Indigenous characters is represented as part of a colonial and post-colonial, contemporary world.

Topping this list was the creation of a mathematical model of a lens, which given the lens geometry and material properties, could predict the deformation of the lens when it was subjected to an impact, such as that experienced in the fracture tests lenses must pass before being approved for sale. The first steps towards such a model were taken at MISG. At MISG, a lens was modelled simply as a thin uniform thickness plate, undergoing small, linear deformations. In the first section of my thesis I extend this model by considering variable thickness plates and larger, nonlinear deformations. For this extended model I have confirmed that the result obtained at MISG, that the contact between a plate and a spherical indentor occurs at a single point, still holds. The second part of this thesis looks at the dynamic deformation, or vibration, of plates. I have developed numerical solution methods for the large amplitude vibration equations with and without the in-plane inertia terms, based on a finite difference scheme. A comparison of these solutions confirms the often used assumption that the in-plane inertia may be neglected. I have also implemented a number of solution methods from the literature, which use separation of variables techniques. Comparing these with the numerical solutions, we find that the numerical solutions better capture the multi-modal nature of the vibration - showing multiple cycles in the approximate period. Having achieved an understanding of the types of forces involved in plate deformation and vibration I consider shell theory in the final section of my thesis. While time constraints meant no dynamic results could be obtained, general nonlinear deep shell equations have been derived. The static version of these equations has then been solved, with the development of a new solution technique which combines a Taylor expansion to approximate the behaviour at the shell centre with a numerical shooting method. Various shallow shell simplifications of the deep shell equations are then discussed and solved. By comparison of the solutions obtained for the deep and shallow, linear and nonlinear equations I have been able to determine which theories apply to which geometries. A complete model of a lens needs to take into account the shape, its thickness and curvature and the material from which it is made. From the work done in this thesis we have been able to determine that a lens model would require the nonlinear theory. Whether the deep shell theory is necessary is debatable as the geometry of a typical lens falls in the grey area, where either theory could be used depending on the accuracy required. For a very accurate model, deep shell theory would be necessary; if an approximate solution obtained quickly was more useful then I suggest the use of a particular set of shallow shell equations. A full lens model would require variable thickness shell theory and the solution of the dynamic equations, neither of which has been achieved here, but the solution techniques I have developed would be applicable to these theories.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">230107 Differential, Difference and Integral Equations</field><field name="subject">230116 Numerical Analysis</field><field name="subject">ophthalmic lenses</field><field name="subject">impact testing</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/28379</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:28379</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of implemented ISO 9000 quality management system with particular reference to small to medium size Hong Kong construction enterprises</field><field name="creator">Luk, Colin K.

Galvanic interaction between the grinding media (mild steel, 15% chromium, 21% chromium and 30% chromium media) and the sulphide minerals (bornite, arsenopyrite and pyrite) was initially quantified in-situ of the mill by electrochemical techniques under different grinding atmospheres (nitrogen, air and oxygen). An innovative mathematical theoretical model was developed to describe the effect of galvanic interaction on oxidation rates of the grinding media during grinding, which was verified by the experimental data. Galvanic interaction enhanced the oxidation of the grinding media and produced more oxidized iron species in the mill discharge. It was observed that oxidized iron species (EDTA extractable iron) was linear with galvanic current between the grinding media and the sulphide minerals, in agreement with the prediction of the theoretical model. The effect of grinding conditions on pulp chemistry, surface properties and floatability was investigated by the measurement of dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, pulp potential (Eh), ethylene diamine-tetra acetic acid (EDTA) extraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and floatation recovery.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mineral Processing</field><field name="subject">grinding</field><field name="subject">oxidation reduction</field><field name="subject">sulphide minerals</field><field name="subject">sulfide</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/28362</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:28362</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical models for temperature and electricity demand</field><field name="creator">Magnano, Luciana</field><field name="description">This thesis presents models that describe the behaviour of electricity demand and ambient temperature.

However, the growing body of evidence in this area of research is predominantly quantitative. This study was designed to engage children in the five to six year age group using qualitative methods and present their notions of body image through the looking glass of the children's own eyes. Children's voices have not often found their way into research. Concerns about their powers of communication, cognitive abilities and the ethical difficulties inherent when working with children have restricted their participation. Objective, empirical evidence suggests that if one engages children in research appropriately they are able to make a significant contribution. Forty-seven children (25=m; 22=f) aged between five and six years were interviewed on three occasions over 12 months regarding their perceptions of body image. Seven schools from the Independent school system were involved. Interviews were conducted on school sites in public, easily observable locations. The study focused on three aspects. That is, how these children perceived their own body, the bodies of other people and their notions of health in respect to body image. These interviews revealed that the girls in this age group had developed an understanding of body image that valued thinness. However, their preference for a thinner body did not negatively impact on their sense of identity or self-worth. Boys preferred larger bodies and correlated increased body size with competence and physical aptitude. The concept of 'large' was linked to height for some or to a mesomorphic body for other boys. By the final interview all the children revealed strong negative perceptions of fatness. These perceptions were more apparent at each successive interview. An obese or extremely thin body was not always correlated with being unhealthy. Depending on the perspective of the child, even the largest of images was nominated the 'healthiest body' by some children. Health was overwhelmingly linked to food intake with few children associating health with exercise. The playground and the home, where most notably mothers, were important in the development of body image conceptions. Children were acutely aware of the dietary practices of their parents and associated diets with losing weight.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">symbolic interactionism</field><field name="subject">children's voices in research</field><field name="subject">Personality, Abilities and Assessment</field><field name="subject">early childhood</field><field name="subject">body image</field><field name="subject">obesity</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/28294</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:28294</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quality assurance for pig carcasses: a study of bacterial contamination at domestic abattoirs in South Australia</field><field name="creator">Skull, John</field><field name="description">This study of four domestic abattoirs in South Australia with Quality Assurance programmes in place established the size of bacterial populations that could be expected on pig carcasses on entry to abattoir dressing floors at pre-evisceration, the extent of contamination occurring during carcass dressing, and the effect of chilling on these populations. Analysis was conducted for salmonellae, Escherichia coli, Total Viable Count, and pseudomonads. Exterior swabbing was compared to swabbing of corresponding interior sites which are sterile initially. The interior swabbing sites were found to be a more reliable measure of contamination during the dressing process than the swabbing of already contaminated exterior sites. During the identification of some of the points of carcass contamination, the effectiveness of end-of-work foam cleaning programmes used at abattoir dressing floors and their relationship to the potential for airborne contamination of carcasses was examined and found to be positive. Operators' work tools and hands were identified as sources of interior carcass contamination combined with failure of operators to adhere to Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) during carcass dressing, especially those related to hand and forearm washing at appropriate times. Foot-operated full-immersion hot water units for operators' knives and steels were designed and installed at two abattoirs to give operators access to physically and biologically clean work tools throughout carcass dressing.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public Health and Health Services not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Medical Bacteriology</field><field name="subject">abattoirs</field><field name="subject">quality assurance</field><field name="subject">pig carcasses</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/28284</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:28284</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Job stress, job control, pay schemes, and organizational outcomes: a study of workers in China</field><field name="creator">Yeung, Joseph</field><field name="description">China, in her rapid industrialization over the last two decades, has successfully grown out of its traditional village image and into a modernized society.

One tool that has been found to assist in these areas is biometrics. This thesis examines some biometric technologies that may be potentially suitable for surveillance and access control applications, and shows why facial recognition technology has been the focus of this study. Despite the testing reported in the literature discussing attempts to solve the problems with facial recognition operational performance, facial recognition has not been widely implemented in security applications to date. The reported testing regimes vary in terms of the date of testing, methodology used for the study, evaluation type, test size and the extent to which possible variations of each variable were examined. To summarise what is known about the effect each variable has on performance, a baseline model of variables together with a ranking scheme is defined and utilised to create a starting point for the research. The research described in this thesis focuses on how to improve the operational performance of two dimensional facial recognition systems by building upon the baseline model of variables and by better understanding how the variables affect facial recognition performance. To improve on the baseline model, systems engineering techniques are used to identify the functional components of a generic facial recognition system, the relationships between them, and the variables that affect those relationships. This identifies other variables that may affect performance. In order to determine which variables affect performance, and how, a series of technical, scenario and operational experiments are conducted to test a selection of the variables. It is shown that this results in a greater understanding of how facial recognition systems react to different variables in operational environments. A revised model of ranked variables is produced that can then be used by current and prospective stakeholders of biometric systems, system designers, integrators and testers to ensure that the majority of the variables are considered when designing, installing, commissioning, or testing facial recognition systems. The findings of this research can also be used to critically analyse existing facial recognition system implementations in order to identify areas where performance increases are possible. This is confirmed in part throughout the two year testing phase of this research where data collected from initial experiments were used as a starting point to improve the performance of later operational experiments. Finally, this thesis identifies that the revised model of variables is sufficiently generic to be used as a starting point for analysing a system using any biometric technology. This is supported by using iris recognition technology as a test case. It is anticipated that with an increased knowledge of how some systems are affected by certain variables, and by better controlling those variables, an increase in performance is possible for access control and surveillance security applications that utilise biometric technologies.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human face recognition (Computer science)</field><field name="subject">Biometry</field><field name="subject">Data processing</field><field name="subject">Computer vision</field><field name="subject">Image processing</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/25036</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:25036</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Country-of-assembly and country-of-components effects for hybrid products: an automotive perspective on ASEAN</field><field name="creator">Seidenfuss, Kai-Uwe</field><field name="description">After more than three decades of country-of-origin (COO) research, product origin has become a more complicated construct.

This paper presents the first detailed literature review of the related new research stream in the COO arena. In this context, the shaping of new trade regimes within the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) provides an interesting hybrid research setting, given that all major regional car segments are dominated by such hybrids -- both for country-of-brand (COB), country-of-assembly (COA), and country-of-components (COC).

Stories are increasingly sourced from books, television, film and the internet. But the research suggests that whilst the sources of stories have changed over time, from family and bible stories to books, radio, television and film, the role of those stories has been constant. It has been argued that there is an important connection between an individual?s perception of their own place in the world, their understanding of what constitutes a good life and how to live it, and their ability to empathise with the lives and problems of others (MacIntyre, 1981; Taylor, 1989; Aristotle, 1996; Kearney, 2002). The research indicates that this core bundle of values, attitudes and beliefs is commonly derived from the stories to which individuals are exposed from an early age. Access to stories with which the individual can personally identify and which are familiar to and shared with those around them is crucial in establishing a satisfactory self-narrative (Polkinghorne, 1988), and to the individual's ability to communicate it successfully through the process of triple mimesis (Ricoeur, 1991/1980). Of crucial importance is access to sharable stories which resemble significant aspects of the recipient's own life and circumstances. Respondents who had endured personal difficulties were more likely to accept their circumstances and live successful lives when they had been able to identify with a story describing a similar problem and its credible resolution. However, individuals who had been unable to identify with a public story and establish a satisfactory self-narrative were more likely to be socially dysfunctional. The research also indicates a correlation between exposure to word-based stories at an early age, and the later development of imagination and ambition. People who only experienced visual stories in their early years appeared less articulate, less able to imagine things beyond their own experience, and were less ambitious in their career aspirations. Australia is an increasingly diverse nation, with a wide and growing variety of cultures, beliefs and circumstances represented in the population. It is argued that to maintain the social health of such a diverse community Australia requires an equally wide variety of public stories to ensure that all sections of the community can find a suitable reflection of their lives and circumstances.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Religion</field><field name="subject">Culture</field><field name="subject">Narration (Rhetoric)</field><field name="subject">Storytelling</field><field name="subject">Mimesis in literature</field><field name="subject">Identity (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Values</field><field name="subject">Mass media</field><field name="subject">Books and reading</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/25033</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:25033</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparison of the performance of intellectually disabled children on the WISC-111 and SB-1V</field><field name="creator">Hansen, Daryl P</field><field name="description">This study investigated the results of administering two intelligence tests, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children -Third Edition (WISC-111), and the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale - Fourth Edition, to each of 33 Australian children with an intellectual disability. The experiment used a counterbalanced design in which the tests, order of presentation of the tests, the gender of the subjects, and the gender of the test administrators were factors. The 33 volunteer subjects, 14 males and 19 females, aged between 6 and 16 years, and known to have an intellectual disability, were allocated randomly for the assessments. The test administrators were students in the Clinical and Organisational Masters Program from the University of South Australia. It was hypothesised that; there would be a difference between the IQs on the two tests; that on average the WISC-111 FSIQ would be lower than the SB-1V TC; and that there would be a positive relationship between the WISC-111 FSIQ and the SB-1 V TC Statistical analysis of the data found the two tests' overall scores to be significantly different, while the counterbalanced factors and their interactions did not reach significance. There was a significant 4 point difference found between the mean WISC-111 FSIQs and SB-1V TCs. The results of a Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient revealed a strong positive correlation (r = .83). between the WISC-111 FSIQ and SB-1V TC. This finding supported the concurrent validity of the tests in this special population sample. It was suggested that while the two tests measured similar theoretical constructs of intelligence, the two tests were not identical and therefore the results were not interchangeable. Variable patterns of results were found among subtest scores from the two tests, and the implications for field work discussed. The differences between raw WISC-111 FSIQ and SB-1V TC scores were calculated, and a z transformation was applied to the difference scores. The resulting difference distribution and cumulative percentages were then suggested as a reference table for practitioners. Studies that examined clerical errors in scoring intelligence test protocols were reviewed. The manually scored test protocols in this study were rescored using a computer scoring programme and 27 errors were found and corrected. From the results of the experiment several suggestions were made; that agencies using large numbers of intelligence tests, or which test the same child over time, should make a decision to use the same test, wherever possible, for comparison; that all intelligence test protocols be computer scored as a checking mechanism; and that all professional staff should be aware of the possible differences which can occur between intelligence scores, resulting from norming and other differences.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Learning disabled children</field><field name="subject">Testing</field><field name="subject">Stanford-Binet Test</field><field name="subject">Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/25032</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:25032</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tractive performance of integrated steering-drive systems</field><field name="creator">Besselink, Bernard Christian</field><field name="description">This research studied the tractive performance of integrated steering-drive systems by investigating a two-wheel-drive vehicle having two independent rear drive wheels and non-driven steerable front wheels. The feasibility of integrating the steering and drive systems and the performance advantages that may be obtained was investigated. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept, the steering system and the drive system of a test vehicle were integrated using a computer with a specially-developed program. The software algorithm developed for the program used the mathematical relationship between the rear drive wheel speeds and the steer angles of the non-driven front wheels to set the steer angles. A test-bed vehicle was fitted with instrumentation to implement the computer-integrated system. The circuitry of the hydraulic lines of the hydraulically-driven test vehicle was modified to allow changes in drive configuration. These changes are not possible with conventional vehicles. The test vehicle could be configured for the following steering-drive configurations: open differential rear drive with steerable front wheels, independent rear drive wheels with front castors, locked differential rear drive with steerable front wheels and the computer-integrated steering-drive system developed. The sensors on the vehicle allowed data collection for characterising the vehicle and wheels. omputer models were developed for the various steering-drive configurations from the force relationships, longitudinal slip relationships, vehicle geometry and turning geometry. Characteristics of the test vehicle's wheels for use in the models were measured experimentally. he models were used to simulate the behaviour, and calculate the tractive performance, of the four steering-drive configurations in various situations but actual tests were not able to be conducted with the available resources. Unlike previous models, the models of this research used force and longitudinal slip information rather than power input and power output to produce values for drawbar efficiency. theoretical analysis was conducted into the optimal slip conditions for maximum tractive efficiency. The analysis was conducted using a more rigorous mathematical analysis than previous researchers and used a thorough graphical analysis to substantiate the mathematical analysis. Previous studies concluded that under all traction conditions the efficiency of slip will be a maximum when the slip of each wheel is equal. This research revealed that, contrary to the previous literature, efficiency of slip will not be a maximum when the slip of each wheel is equal under non-uniform traction conditions. The simulations were focussed on turning situations, non-uniform traction conditions and traversing slopes. The optimal slip conditions and steer angles for turning situations were also investigated and analysed. The computer-integrated steering-drive system achieved a drawbar pull 50% higher than that for a conventional open differential when undertaking a 10 m radius turn with non-uniform traction conditions. Under these conditions, the drawbar efficiency of the computer-integrated steering-drive system was 5% greater than that for the open differential at the lower drawbar pull. It was concluded that it is feasible and beneficial to use a computer-integrated steering system. Vehicles using such a system would operate more effectively and efficiently when turning under load, moving across slopes and in non-uniform traction conditions. More effectiveness was provided through greater drawbar pull and higher drawbar efficiency.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Automobiles</field><field name="subject">Steering-gear</field><field name="subject">Steering-drive</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/44846</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:25007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimisation of assembly sequences using genetic algorithms</field><field name="creator">Marian, Romeo Marin</field><field name="description">Assembly Sequence Planning (ASP) is part of Assembly Planning. The assembly sequence is the most important part of an assembly plan. Assembly has an important share in both lead time and cost of a product. Therefore, its optimisation is necessary to ensure the competitivity of manufactured goods. The aim of this thesis is the optimisation of assembly sequences for mechanical products, for real/realistic problems and constraints. This thesis represents an integrated approach in assembly sequence planning and optimisation. It tackles real problems by building the generality in the models. The ASP problem is a large scale, highly constrained, combinatorial problem, with an extraordinarily diverse character. Assembly can address sequential or non-sequential, linear or non-linear, monotone or non-monotone, coherent or non-coherent assembly plans or any combination of those, involving rigid, elastic, non elastic, solid, liquid or gaseous components or subassemblies. To be applicable in practice and useful, an assembly sequence planning and optimisation algorithm has to be general enough to accommodate any type of assembly plan and component. For this reason, modelling becomes critically important. A model has been developed for the assembly process, to determine what the assembly process is in mathematical terms. A second model has been developed to model/represent assembly plans as chromosomes that encode any type and combination of assembly plans. Another model has been developed for modelling/representing products for assembly. This model constitutes the database containing all information necessary for generating feasible assembly sequences, for any type of component and subassembly. A framework has been developed for the definition of a fitness function to assess the quality of an assembly sequence and plan from optimisation criteria. Solving the ASP problem (prior to its optimisation), implies generating a sequence to assemble an n-part product given its description and a number of supplementary constraints. A guided search algorithm has been developed to solve the ASP problem. To optimise the ASP, Genetic Algorithms (GA) were used in this research. The GA has a classic structure and modified genetic operators: it only generates and manipulates legal and feasible chromosomes. An initial population of feasible chromosomes is generated through guided search. This population, then, undergoes transformations over a number of generations, through crossover and selection. The crossover, based on the guided search algorithm, is also designed to produce only legal chromosomes. The selection is a classical operation, through a weighed roulette algorithm. It operates on an extended population of parent and children chromosomes. The output of the GA is a population of chromosomes with a high fitness value, corresponding to optimal/near optimal assembly sequences, from which the best one is selected. A number of examples are used in each chapter to illustrate each significant aspect considered. A final example illustrates the application of the whole algorithm to produce optimised assembly sequences for an industrial-size product.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Genetic algorithms</field><field name="subject">Assembly-line methods</field><field name="subject">Automation</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24954</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24954</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Body talk and masculinities texting gender without the body</field><field name="creator">Davison, Kevin</field><field name="description">This dissertation investigates how masculinities are understood and practiced through the body and how such practices are shaped and limited by modernist theories about gender. The research argues that postmodern theory allows for a greater inclusivity of genders and bodies otherwise marginalised by modernity. A qualitative postmodern and poststructural methodology, combined with a research method involving the collection of all data via an on-line questionnaire, disrupts modernist, dualistic thinking about the body and gender. By distancing the physical body from the research method, and thus separating, temporarily, discourses of gender which inhabit the body, this research creates counter-hegemonic spaces to re-articulate masculine identities and practices within the postmodern condition. Furthermore, the postmodern theory and methodology informing this work unsettles the belief that physical bodies can be counted on to reveal consistent truths. The contextualisation of this work includes a chapter that recounts various historical moments where technological advancements made way for the re-consideration and re-negotiation of gender and bodies. The intersections of technology and modernity are examined along with the rise of the postmodern condition and the advancement of computer technologies. Shifts in understanding, influenced by postmodern theory and human-computer interaction, are discussed in relation to their challenges to modernist boundaries of ?the real? and, in turn, the possibilities of gender articulations. Additionally, a chapter containing critical researcher reflexivity through an autobiographical account of masculinities and schooling acts to illustrate some of the complexities, contradictions, privileges and counter-hegemonic possibilities of masculinities and bodies. Although the majority of the research participants identified as ?male?, some identified as ?female? and others identified as ?intersex?. The geographic identities of the respondents included Australia, The United Kingdom, Ireland, The United States, and Japan. The data were analysed using postmodern and poststructural theory. The subjectivity and the role of the researcher in the analysis of data were interrogated alongside the words of the participants. The responses were grouped into four areas: Being and Knowing; The Body Engendered; Bodies On-Line and On the Line, and New Articulations. In all four areas the participants? words demonstrate tensions between modern and postmodern understandings of bodies and genders. Computer technologies often replicate modernist images of gender and bodies, yet at the same time they provide a postmodern space of multiplicity, fluidity, and hybridity, where rigid modernist configurations cannot hold. The analysis illuminates, diffracts, disrupts, and highlights disjunctures and new possibilities for gender and bodies mediated by contemporary computer and Internet technologies. Lastly, Benjaminian dialectical images were used to transform fixed modernist beliefs about gender and bodies and to move the reader toward alternative ways of understanding gender which are not body dependent.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Masculinity</field><field name="subject">Body image in men</field><field name="subject">Gender identity</field><field name="subject">Men</field><field name="subject">Identity</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24935</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24935</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on Mesenchymal growth factors during postnatal growth of the small intestine</field><field name="creator">Gordon, Colin R</field><field name="description">Postnatal growth of the small intestine can be divided into two separate but complementary mechanisms; mucosal growth and organ (cylindrical) growth. Mucosal growth, observed by increasing villus area and crypt length, is upregulated during weaning, compared to pre or post-weaned time frames. The dynamics of organ growth, mediated by the process of crypt fission, is unknown during this period of postnatal development. Keratinocyte Growth Factor (KGF) and Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) are mesenchymally derived ligands which have been demonstrated to have trophic effects on the epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract in vitro and in vivo during embryonic development, repair/restitution and tumour progression. This study explores the hypothesis that small intestine organ growth occurs independently to that of mucosal growth and the mechanisms of growth are mediated by differential expression of either HGF or KGF within the pericryptal mesenchyme derived cells (fibroblasts). Alternatively, the corresponding receptors for these ligands, c-met and bek, may exhibit differential expression within the proliferative compartment of the crypts. The indices of mucosal and organ growth were compared at various ages during early postnatal life (suckling), then early, middle and late weaning through to adult animals. Microdissection techniques utilising whole tissue samples enabled microscopic evaluation of growth. The assessment of KGF, bek, HGF and c-met was also undertaken using immunohistochemistry on formalin fixed, paraffin processed sections of rat jejunum. The highest rate of organ growth occurred during weaning and was immediately preceded at day 14 (of age) by a peak in the incidence of branching crypts. KGF immunolabelling was observed within the mesenchymal cells at the tips of the villus from mid-weaning onwards but at no stage within pericryptal fibroblasts. Both KGF and bek were demonstrated within the crypt epithelium, with highest levels observed during weaning. Immunolabelling for HGF demonstrated an ubiquitous distribution within both epithelial and mesenchymal tissues at all ages, whilst the expression of c-met was in the crypt cell compartment was limited to the time of weaning. The use of an in vivo blockade technique utilising an anti-HGF (D9) antibody from age 7 to 14 days did not demonstrate any reduction of the indices of organ or mucosal growth. These results suggest that rate of organ and mucosal growth increase concurrently during weaning. The demonstration of both bek and c-met in the crypt cell population during this period suggests that KGF and HGF are potential mediators of organ or mucosal growth, despite only HGF being demonstrated in the pericryptal mesenchymal derived cells. Further, the expression of KGF and HGF at sites beyond the crypts suggest these ligands play a greater role in the development of the rat small intestine during postnatal growth.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intestine, Small</field><field name="subject">Child development</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24990</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24990</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surviving breast cancer a discourse analysis of breast cancer self-help groups</field><field name="creator">Bayers, Linda Sylvia</field><field name="description">Although there is a burgeoning canon addressing the detection, cause, treatment, and cure of breast cancer, there is a paucity of studies exploring how women survive the disruption and uncertainty breast cancer produces in their daily lives. There has been little exploration in the adult learning literature on the ways women might learn to live with breast cancer in the context of a heightened sense of mortality. Current institutional health education programs do not address the particular needs of individual women for practical and emotional support. In addition, the perspectives, resources, and knowledge of breast cancer self-help groups are not included in the literature on living with breast cancer. This study portrays survivor voices through the use of in-depth interviewing, participant observation, and document analysis. I use perspectives from feminist poststructuralism and Foucauldian discourse theory to explore the ways that the sixty-one women attending four breast cancer self-help groups in the late 1990s in urban and rural areas of Nova Scotia, Canada, learn to survive ? that is live with, through, and beyond ? breast cancer. While there was some variance in socioeconomic status and ethnicity, the participants were largely financially secure, married with children, of European descent, and between the ages of 33 and 83. This research shows that in their quest for survival, survivors moved amongst four overlapping discursive locations - the breast cancer self-help group, the family, the public sphere, and the cancer-care system with both support and conflict. Group discourses of reciprocity, self-care, temporality, and hope produce a range of discursive strategies for generating active survivor subjectivities. Through storytelling and the use of a powerful group technology, the survivor gaze, group members deconstruct the power technologies that disempower them. The analysis shows that survivors are active and resourceful in creating resistant, innovative, life-affirming, and self-respecting ways to speak themselves into social texts as authoritative and legitimate knowers, doers, and learners, producing new knowledge, resources, and truths about surviving. However, it is a major challenge for survivors to cope with the tense and contradictory effects of pervasive power and gender relations on the modes of subjectivities open to them. While masking of the postmastectomy body indicates that women are working on gendered identities, survivors are also learning to live their bodies in flux, taking up performative, cyborgian, productive, and playful bodies that challenge male-imposed definitions of what it is to be a woman, insisting on their right to define themselves. This thesis challenges the assumption that subjects must submit to the knowledge of experts in order to know, invent, and care for themselves. The research corroborates important insights from the self-help literature that self-help groups are significant social movements producing knowledgeable political subjects able to exercise power over their own lives. There is ample evidence that the expression and validation of emotions are central to knowledge construction processes. Further research is needed to examine how the knowledge produced by self-help groups can become officially recognized and utilized resources for survivors, and for those who care for and about them.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Breast</field><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="subject">Canada</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24977</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24977</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flight crew fatigue in Australian short-haul operations and methodologies for assessing fatigue in-flight</field><field name="creator">Loh, Sylvia</field><field name="description">The focus of this thesis is fatigue in aviation. It presents a detailed analysis of subjective fatigue and sleep patterns in short-haul operations. This operation was chosen because short-haul rosters encompass a range of scheduling factors that have been identified in the shiftwork literature as having a negative impact on alertness and performance. It is contended that studies examining these factors in the commercial aviation industry are scarce, and of those available, limited to investigations conducted outside of Australia. In addition, this thesis addresses a methodological limitation that has, to date, restricted the ability to measure fatigue during flight. It is contended that the scarcity of in-flight studies stems from the lack of a suitable performance test for measuring fatigue in time-constrained operating environments, such as aviation. The studies presented in this thesis are divided into two sections. The first section comprises three aviation studies conducted in Qantas airlines. The first two aviation studies examined the effects of scheduling factors on the subjective fatigue of flight crew employed by Qantas airlines. Two different populations were examined: B767 and B737 flight crew. Participants rated their fatigue and recorded information about their flying patterns for a minimum of 15 days. The results indicated that flight crew experienced mild to moderate fatigue in relation to their work. Importantly, different scheduling factors contributed to fatigue, including length of the flight duty period, number of flying hours, and duty start times. The third aviation study examined the sleep of B737 flight crew across a 3-day schedule. Sleep quantity and quality were determined from a sleep diary and wrist actigraphy data. The results indicated that sleep offset time, sleep duration, and sleep quality significantly varied across the schedule. In addition, early morning start times and late evening end times were key factors contributing to reduced sleep. The second section of this thesis comprises two laboratory studies that assessed the sensitivity of a brief (i.e. less than 10 minutes) psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) to the effects of sleep loss. A preliminary study compared performance during the 10-minute PVT with performance during the first half of the PVT during a night of wakefulness (23:00 ? 07:00 hours). A subsequent study compared performance during a 10-minute PVT with performance during a 90-second PVT and a 5-minute PVT during 28 hours of sustained wakefulness. The findings of the latter study indicated that performance during the 5-minute PVT and the 90-second PVT deteriorated in a manner similar to that observed during the standard 10-minute PVT. However, in line with the findings reported in the preliminary study, the shorter the task sampling time, the less sensitive the test to response slowing and performance variability. Based on these findings, it was surmised that a 5-minute PVT is likely to provide a more accurate measure of performance impairment than a test of shorter duration. Moreover, it was proposed that a 5-minute PVT may provide researchers with a reliable test for assessing changes in performance. In summary, the results of the aviation studies indicate that a number of scheduling factors contribute to fatigue and disturbed sleep in Australian domestic operations. The findings of this thesis are of particular concern, given that current aviation regulations do not fully consider the extent to which scheduling demands affect flight crew. It is apparent that flight crew would benefit from the incorporation of such findings into duty and rest limitations and scheduling procedures. Evidence demonstrating that (1) fatigue accumulates across the flight duty period, and (2) flight crew are at particular risk of higher fatigue when they are rostered to work an early morning duty suggests that the length of the flight duty period, the number of sectors worked and the timing of the duty period warrant particular attention. Finally, the results of the laboratory studies hold particular promise for future research, since they suggest that the 5-minute PVT may provide researchers with an alternative tool for investigating fatigue in the flying environment.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aeronautics</field><field name="subject">Human factors</field><field name="subject">Air pilots</field><field name="subject">Health and hygiene</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Flight crews</field><field name="subject">Fatigue</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24975</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24975</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A knowledge-based approach to rapid system development of business information systems</field><field name="creator">Ho, Michael Moon Tong</field><field name="description">Business information systems have been targets for rapid application development because potential productivity gains can translate into huge returns on investment for organizations. However, to realize the perceived productivity improvement presents a major challenge to today?s information systems managers and requires new development approaches. End user computing is an approach to reduce the backlog of user requests for information needs through which end users are given the software tools to create their own reports and extract the information they need. Some end-users attempted to build their own information systems with fourth generation language (4GL) but failed partly due to the programming skills required of them. Although fourth generation languages have been promoted as a means to enhance programmer productivity by an order of magnitude more, later studies by researchers showed less dramatic results. The many problems and deficiencies of 4GL created obstacles to achieve spectacular improvement in productivity as promoted. A new knowledge-based approach to rapid business information systems development is attempted in this study to overcome the shortcomings of 4GL. A prototype system consisting of a knowledgebase is integrated with an object-oriented application generator to alleviate the need for conventional programming skills. Typical information system functionalities of database creation and updating are provided through a framework of reusable business information system components. These are object classes arranged and instantiated in a certain way directed by a specification language. The knowledgebase enables the translation of user requirements via the specification language that explicitly avoids the prerequisite programming skills required of the developer. The specification language is non-procedural in that specifications can be specified in any order. It does not follow the basic programming language constructs of sequence, decision and repetition. Additionally, the customizable rules allow the developer to validate the specifications before generating the desired application. Maintenance and enhancement of the generated application is modified by regenerating from the modified knowledge-based facts and rules, at a higher level than conventional programming languages or even 4GL. Experiments with small groups of end-users and developers found this approach to be viable. Although the specification process is tedious, no programming skills were ever required other than spreadsheet like expressions. The absence of programming logic prevents most of the errors caused by newly constructed information systems. Testing is still required, but the remedies are much easier. In conclusion, the study has demonstrated the feasibility of a knowledge-based approach to rapid system development of business information systems. This approach enables technical and end-user alike to rapidly develop such systems without programming. The application generator is built with reusable business information system components that can be added and extended to support more capabilities. The knowledgebase can be enhanced with corresponding new rules and facts to enable the user developer to build new functionalities into existing or new systems. Business information system development can be lifted to a higher-level than procedural specifications, and assisted by knowledge-based inference to achieve spectacular productivity improvements.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information storage and retrieval systems</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="subject">Computer network resources</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24991</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24991</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Everyday as problematic in the worklives of women TAFE teachers</field><field name="creator">Rimmer, Anthea Susan</field><field name="description">As knowledge workers in post-compulsory education, contemporary women Technical and Further Education (TAFE) teachers help train Australia's skilled workforce.

Taking a postmodern approach, the thesis argues that the concepts of 'the child' and 'childhood' are social constructs produced by discourses that have arisen from historical accounts of the position of children in 'adult' society. The knowledge thus produced constructs children as incomplete beings, vulnerable and unable to understand significant issues such as those associated with parental separation. Consequently, children are marginalised, 'othered' and denied the opportunity to participate in decisions that directly affect them. After reviewing the ways in which discourses operate to subjectify children in this way, the thesis explores an alternative construction of children as competent and resilient, able to participate with their adult counterparts in decision-making activities. The potential for the provisions of both the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Australian Family Law Reform Act 1995 to reconstruct children in this way is explored. Reviews of the literature indicated that Australian children had not been included in research and discussions about their involvement in decisions that directly affected them. Consequently, this research undertook in-depth interviews of sixteen children between the ages of 7 and 17 years. Their views about their abilities to participate in decisions that directly affect them are reviewed in relation to the different discourses identified in the literature. The extent to which children?s understandings reflect these discourses is considered. The thesis argues that much is still to be achieved. A review of the findings includes an account of the difficulties experienced in recruiting children for this project and suggests that the social construction of children continues to position them as vulnerable and incompetent. It is argued that the constructs of 'competence', 'age' and 'maturity' are not useful indicators of children's abilities to make decisions; thus, a 'new' construction of children, based on greater adult understanding of their unique experiences and understandings, is suggested. In relation to decisions that affect children following parental separation, the thesis makes a number of suggestions that support an exploration of creative initiatives that reflect the children's views.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Family law</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Children's rights</field><field name="subject">Parent and child (Law)</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24966</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24966</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling and analysis of the resource reservation protocol using coloured petri nets</field><field name="creator">Villapol, Maria</field><field name="description">The Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) is one of the proposals of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) for conveying Quality of Service (QoS) related information in the form of resource reservations along the communication path. The RSVP specification (i.e. Request for Comments 2205) provides a narrative description of the protocol without any use of formal techniques. Thus, some parts of the document may be ambiguous, difficult to understand, and imprecise. So far, RSVP implementations have provided the only mechanism for validating. The cost for fixing errors in the protocol found in the implementation can be high. These disadvantages together with the fact that RSVP is complex make it a good target for formal specification and verification. This thesis formally defines the RSVP Service Specification, models RSVP using a formal method known as Coloured Petri Nets (CPNs) and attempts to verify the model. The following steps summarise the verification process of RSVP. Firstly, the RSVP service specification is derived from the protocol description and modelled using CPNs. After validating the model, the service language, which defines all the possible service primitive occurrence sequences, is generated from the state space of the model by using automata reduction techniques that preserve sequences. Secondly, RSVP is modelled using CPNs. The model is analysed for a set of behavioural properties. They include general properties of protocols, such as correct termination, and a set of new properties defined in this thesis, which are particular to RSVP. The analysis is based on the state space method. The properties are checked by querying the state graph and checking reachability among multiple nodes of its associated Strongly Connected Component (SCC) graph. As a first step, we analyse RSVP under the assumption of a perfect medium (no loss or duplication) to ensure that protocol errors are not hidden by rare events of the medium. The state space is reduced to obtain the sequences of service primitives allowed by RSVP known as the protocol language. Then, the protocol language is compared with the service language to determine if they are equivalent. The desired properties of RSVP are proved to be satisfied by the RSVP CPN model, so that the features of RSVP included in the CPN model operate as expected under our modelling and analysis assumptions. Also, the language analysis results show that RSVP service primitive occurrence sequences generated by the RSVP model are included in the proposed model of the service specification. However, some service primitive occurrence sequences generated from the service specification model are not in the protocol language. These sequences were analysed. There is strong evidence to suggest that these sequences would also appear in the protocol if the capacity of the medium in the RSVP model was marginally increased. Unfortunately, the standard reachability analysis tools would not handle this case, due to state space explosion.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Petri nets</field><field name="subject">Computer networks</field><field name="subject">Electronic data processing</field><field name="subject">Distributed processing</field><field name="subject">Computer network protocols</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24944</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24944</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spiritual orientation in relation to spiritual intelligence a consideration of traditional Christianity and New Ageindividualistic spirituality</field><field name="creator">Nasel, Dagmar</field><field name="description">This thesis focuses on the conceptualisation and expression of spiritual intelligence among ?traditional?

The purpose is to describe the research process, to present data, and to draw conclusions. Chapter 1 describes the structure of the paper and introduces two theoretical issues which arise in the data and are referred to in the literature (commodification and collectionism) but are not the focus of this study. Nevertheless, they seem to explain some important relationships between these three themes and are referred to in the conclusion. Chapter 2 presents recent references to literature from around the world related to the three themes. The review highlights the weakness that few references describe the practical implementation of a theoretical management approach to effecting educational change through teacher education. Chapter 3 describes in detail the successful application of the management approach of the learning organisation, the practical implementation of an educational change, and the resultant teacher education within the alternative programme section of the university department studied. Chapter 4 covers the methodological process of the data collection for this research. The data collection is comprised of: 1) a questionnaire about teacher education activities; 2) a lengthy interview with each of thirty academic staff, the Head of Department, and a Vice-President; 3) supporting documents; and, 4) my observations as participant-observer. Chapter 5 presents the findings and discussion. They are analysed in an overall manner and then re-analysed between two groups of staff. One group is part of the teacher education described in Chapter 3; the other group is the remainder of the staff who had not been part of that teacher education. The findings of the questionnaires, the interviews, and the supporting documents indicate that differences in attitude toward teacher education exist between staff who has been exposed to different teacher education management approaches. These findings also show that staff who have been affected and staff who have been unaffected by the learning organisation approach to staff development note differences in management approach. Both staff and appraisers evaluate the learning organisation management approach used in the alternative programme section of the department very positively. Chapter 6 ends with conclusions, links back to the literature, and suggestions. The conclusions show that the educational change found in this research is similar to the change listed in the literature. The shortcomings and issues of teacher education in this research are similar to those revealed in the literature. The conclusions also support the importance of management approach and its relationship to effective teacher education. It ends with a summary of the positive results of using a learning organisation management approach in teacher education at this site. The final chapter also refers back to commodification and collectionism noted in the introduction and suggests that they should also be considered by teachers, managers and researchers in further work on teacher education.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Education, Higher</field><field name="subject">Hong Kong</field><field name="subject">Universities and colleges</field><field name="subject">Teacher education</field><field name="subject">Hong Kong</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24943</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24943</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heterogeneity in brand choice</field><field name="creator">Rungie, Campbell Maxton</field><field name="description">The Dirichlet Model has been fitted to purchase behaviour in many product categories. The model uses the Dirichlet multinomial distributions to account for heterogeneity between customers in brand choice. The research reported here applies the concept of heterogeneity, developed in the Dirichlet Model, to other areas in marketing. It works through a range of classic market research techniques showing the changes and improvements that result from the consideration of heterogeneity in brand choice. The analysis has implications for (1) sample size calculations (2) the estimation of variance and reliability for nominal variables, (3) the evaluation of logistic and multinomial logit models, (4) the method and design of research which uses discrete choice models, (5) the evaluation of the similarities and differences between product categories and (6) the analysis and measurement of purchase feedback effects. The work also examines methods for identifying if a set of data conforms to the Dirichlet distribution. The work develops a concept of heterogeneity for a nominal variable, which was always known but the implications not fully understood. Discrete choice is a random Bernoulli trial based on a probability. The thesis embodied in the work presented here is that: across the population there is not a single probability, but a probability variable. The probability distribution of this variable is known as the mixing distribution. Analysis should focus on the attributes of this probability variable, and in particular its heterogeneity, rather than on the specific discrete brand choice. If all choice is based on the one, single underlying probability then there is no heterogeneity in the probabilities; there is no mixing distribution. If there is no heterogeneity in the probabilities then an analysis of the discrete choice is an analysis of random data evolving from repeated Bernoulli trials. The Dirichlet and Dirichlet multinomial distributions provide a strong framework for the analysis of the probability variable.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brand choice</field><field name="subject">Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Brand name products</field><field name="subject">Consumers</field><field name="subject">Consumers' preferences</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24950</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24950</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integer programming methods for solving multi-skilled workforce optimisation problems</field><field name="creator">Eitzen, Guy E</field><field name="description">Generating employee rosters on a 24 hour, 7 day per week basis taking into account fluctuating demand for employees, employee skills, working conditions, training and employee preferences, while ensuring efficiency and equity between the employees is a very difficult task due to the very large number of possible rostering combinations available.

They can implement fine grained parallel computing architectures and algorithms in hardware that were previously the domain of custom VLSI. Field programmable gate arrays have shown themselves useful at exploiting concurrency in a range of applications such as text searching, image processing and encryption. When coupled with a microprocessor, which is more suited to computation involving complex control flow and non time critical requirements, they form a potentially versatile platform commonly known as a Reconfigurable Computer. Reconfigurable computing applications have traditionally had the exclusive use of the field programmable gate array, primarily because the logic densities of the available devices have been relatively similar in size compared to the application. But with the modern FPGA expanding beyond 10 million system gates, and through the use of dynamic reconfiguration, it has become feasible for several applications to share a single high density device. However, developing applications that share a device is difficult as the current design flow assumes the exclusive use of the FPGA resources. As a consequence, the designer must ensure that resources have been allocated for all possible combinations of loaded applications at design time. If the sequence of application loading and unloading is not known in advance, all resource allocation cannot be performed at design time because the availability of resources changes dynamically. The use of a runtime resource allocation environment modelled on a classical software operating system would allow the full benefits of dynamic reconfiguration on high density FPGAs to be realised. In addition to runtime resource allocation, other services provided by an operating system such as abstraction of I/O and inter-application communication would provide additional benefits to the users of a reconfigurable computer. This could possibly reduce the difficulty of application development and deployment. In this thesis, an operating system for reconfigurable computing that supports dynamically arriving applications is presented. This is achieved by firstly developing the abstractions with which designers implement their applications and a set of algorithm requirements that specify the resource allocation and logic partitioning services. By combining these, an architecture of an operating system for reconfigurable computing can be specified. A prototype implementation on one platform with multiple applications is then presented which enables an exploration of how the resource allocation algorithms interact amongst themselves and with typical applications. Results obtained from the prototype include the measurement of the performance loss in applications, and the time overheads introduced due to the use of the operating system. Comparisons are made with programmable logic applications run with and without the operating system. The results show that the overheads are reasonable given the current state of the technology of FPGAs. Formulas for predicting the user response time and application throughput based on the fragmentation of an FPGA are then derived. Weaknesses are highlighted in the current design flows and the architecture of current FPGAs must be rectified if an operating system is to become main-stream. For the tool flows this includes the ability to pre-place and pre-route cores and perform high speed runtime routing.

The influence on the design outcome by diverse factors such as climate, landform, community profile, local history, and the methodologies employed during project planning and implementation was examined. The process of community consultation and participation was seen as particularly important in this context, so was examined in depth. The Design Practice Methodology developed by Fifth Creek Studio, who specialise in landscape architecture, public art and urban design, was combined with Action Research, Heuristics and other methodologies to form the basis of the thesis methodology. This was supported by oral histories, interviews and a questionnaire with case study participants. The analysis and synthesis of complex and interwoven aspects of landscape art projects in rural communities provides the basis from which to formulate a design framework for future landscape art projects.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Landscape architecture</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">City planning</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24989</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24989</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Joint source-channel coding for image transmission and related topics</field><field name="creator">Xiang, Wei</field><field name="description">With the integration of wireless technologies and multimedia services, transmitting high quality images and video has become one of the main objectives for next generations mobile network systems. Shannon's classic separation theorem states that, under ideal conditions, source coding and channel coding can be treated separately without sacrificing any performance for the whole system. However, this theorem holds true only under ideal conditions. Practical communication systems do not meet such requirements. Therefore, joint source and channel coding may reduce distortion, as well as complexity and delay. In this thesis, different schemes of joint source-channel coding and decoding for error resilient image transmission over noisy channels are examined. Unequal error protection (UEP) is one of the techniques used in joint source and channel coding. A JPEG image is partitioned into DC components and AC components according to their respective sensitivity to channel noise. The highly sensitive DC components are better protected with a low coding rate, while the less sensitive AC components use a high coding rate. Simulation results show that the proposed UEP scheme slightly outperforms conventional equal error protection (EEP). A novel turbo diversity scheme (TDS) applied to JPEG coded images is proposed. Turbo codes have a built-in structure that is suitable for diversity techniques used to improve the quality of communications over a multi-path channel. The same image data is encoded by two separate turbo encoders and sent over two independent channels. The received data is then passed to a single turbo decoder. By utilising the built-in structure of the turbo encoder, the transmitted JPEG data encoded by a rate half code is recovered at the receiver using a more powerful rate third code yielded by the TDS. An iterative source-channel decoding scheme applied to JPEG coded images is investigated. Huffman codes used as the variable-length coding scheme in JPEG coding can be represented by an irregular VLC-trellis structure. State transition probabilities can be derived from the irregular trellis and can be used as a priori information to help iterative decoding between source and channel a posteriori probability (APP) decoders. Iterative decoding of JPEG coded images only gives a small coding gain due to the poor distance property of the original JPEG Huffman codes. We propose to replace the Huffman codes used in JPEG coding with error resilient source codes with larger free distance. After accounting for the penalty due to the increased average codeword length, the new scheme achieves a 4 dB coding gain over the conventional system for a range of SNRs. While the focus of this thesis is on joint source-channel coding, two other related topics are also examined, namely, capacity and normalisation of intersymbol interference (ISI) channels and parallel data convolutional codes. Previously published results showed a minimum Eb/N0 of -4.6 dB, 3 dB below the capacity of a flat channel, is obtained using the water-pouring capacity formulas for the 1+D channel. However, these results did not take into account that the channel power gain can be greater than unity when water-pouring is used. We present a new generic power normalization method of ISI channel frequency spectra, namely peak bandwidth normalisation, to facilitate the fair capacity comparison of various ISI channels. A final contribution presented in this thesis regards the proposed parallel data convolutional codes (PDCCs). The encoder inputs consist of the original block of data and its interleaved version. We propose a novel single self-iterative soft-input/soft-output (SISO) decoder structure for the decoding of PDCC. It has the advantage of needing only one APP decoder. Although the performance is not very encouraging, the novelty of the self-iterative idea behind the design is worth exploiting.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems</field><field name="subject">Coding theory</field><field name="subject">Image transmission</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24982</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24982</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population modelling the yellow-footed rock-wallaby (petrogale xanthopus xanthopus) in space and time</field><field name="creator">Lethbridge, Mark</field><field name="description">Conservation biology is primarily concerned with the amelioration of species decline. The Yellow-footed Rock-wallaby (Petrogale xanthopus xanthopus) is a medium-sized Macropod that inhabits the semiarid rangelands of South Australia and New South Wales. Its conservation status is Vulnerable C2a(i). In this study, population modelling, spatially explicit habitat modelling and Population Viability Analysis (PVA) have been used to better understand the factors that affect the abundance and distribution of the P. x. xanthopus in South Australia. The processes that drive the population dynamics of a species operate at different scales. As such this research involves a collection of several inter-related and scale-specific empirical studies that provide insights about the population dynamics of P. x. xanthopus. Each of these studies captures environmental, demographic and behavioural process acting on the population at different scales. These include the analysis of relative abundance data derived from an aerial census, mark recapture sampling of demographic parameters in relation to rainfall patterns and a collection of habitat models derived at different scales using presence-absence data. Spatially explicit PVAs enable the population dynamics of a species to be modelled in space and time. Using these data, a PVA is conducted to explore and rank the importance of the factors that threaten this species and help guide their future monitoring and management. Movement is also a key issue when considering problems such as isolation and inbreeding. Given that little is known about the dispersal behaviour of this species, a range of different dispersal behaviours are also simulated in the PVA using random and non-random mating algorithms, to estimate the potential for inbreeding.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Yellow-footed rock wallaby</field><field name="subject">Animal populations</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Conservation biology</field><field name="subject">Mathematical models</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24981</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24981</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Toward creativity in early childhood education a case study of the creative processes used by early childhood educators in curriculum planning for you</field><field name="creator">Broinowski, Ian</field><field name="description">This study aimed to discover ways of designing children's programs using creativity and imagination that are unique and relevant to young children. It examined whether the degree to which the early childhood professional's own sense of enchantment, creativeness and imagination is or is not inextricably linked to the creative and imaginative output of young children in childcare contexts. It evaluated the link between an educator?s own sense of enchantment, imagination and creativeness and the quality of the program offered to young children in childcare centres. The study also identified ways of enriching the care of children in childcare centres through programs that would enhance the children?s imagination and creativeness, utilising the individuality of the teacher/carer?s own ideas on creativity and program design. A case-study methodology was chosen to determine the answers to the posed questions. Three case studies in Hobart and one in Brisbane, using a variety of research tools, including interviews, the application of a creativity assessment sheet, observations and photography, were used to answer the research questions. The results in this small-scale study showed that the early childhood educator's own sense of enchantment and use of imagination and creativity did correlate with the children's imagination and creativity and also with the quality of the program. A conclusion is that an educator's creative disposition is a vital factor in the enrichment of the care of children in childcare contexts.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Education, Preschool</field><field name="subject">Early childhood teachers</field><field name="subject">Curriculum planning</field><field name="subject">Creative thinking</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24941</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24941</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The discursive representation of international undergraduate students a case study of a higher education institutional site</field><field name="creator">Kumar, Margaret Kamla Wati Singh</field><field name="description">This dissertation addresses the discursive representation of international undergraduate students from the areas of South East Asia and Africa.

Both sociological and psychological factors influence the use of police discretionary powers. There are said to be strong relationships between authoritarianism, for example, and justice outcomes. Other measures, such as cynicism and punitiveness, have been observed to be influential predictors of police behaviour. Extending the work on jury decision-making, along with other police research, the present research examines use of police discretionary powers with young offenders. Sworn police officers from two jurisdictions, New Zealand and New South Wales, responded to written surveys about their past and intended future behaviour surrounding four crimes most commonly conducted by young offenders. In all, over 500 officers took part in the studies. Further, participants responded to a battery of personality and attitude questionnaires, along with questions about situational variables normally taken into consideration by officers. Results show that police behaviour towards the same offending varies greatly, both within and across jurisdictions. New Zealand police officers were much more likely than New South Wales police officers to report that they diverted, rather than arrested, young offenders who had committed shoplifting and burglary offences. However, when responding to scenarios of underage drinking and assault, it was New South Wales police who were more likely to divert young offenders. There were very few significant relationships between attitudes and behaviour when examining either group, with significant results possibly being a side effect of large sample sizes. Further there were few significant relationships when considering demographic or situational variables. However, in an exploration of police personality, through cluster analysis, evidence was found for different 'typologies', or resonances, of police. The results indicate that police are not an homogenous group. In addition, quite complex relationships between measures of police behaviour and individual difference were found within the resonances, with effect sizes showing moderate results. The findings support the need to investigate further personality typologies and extend them to the examination of attitude-behaviour relationships. In addition, research into the use of an attitudinal measure, such as discretionary ideology, as an alternative to measuring behaviour could be expanded. Moreover, broadening of the research into additional areas of the juvenile justice systems, such as legal representatives, magistrates, and youth detention centre officers, would provide further insight into the appropriate use of discretion within juvenile justice for both minor offending and more serious offending.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Police services for juveniles</field><field name="subject">Police discretion</field><field name="subject">Law enforcement</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Juvenile delinquency</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24956</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24956</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Succession planning for middle managers in US subsidiaries in Hong Kong</field><field name="creator">Neirynck, Baudouin C R</field><field name="description">During the 1990's, most Hong Kong companies experienced extremely high Voluntary Turnover among middle managers.

In the last decade Australia's arts community has shown increased interest in contemporary Asian art. However there is little evidence of specific interest in Malaysian visual arts practice, despite strong associations between the two countries over many decades. Relations between Malaysia and Australia are problematised by complex political, cultural and religious factors, particularly evident over the last decade when diplomatic tensions escalated. Despite these factors, there has been little research on this subject and no major comprehensive critical analysis of cross-cultural visual arts exchange between the two countries. Although the last major visual arts exhibition from Malaysia to Australian state galleries took place between 1969 and 1970, there has been substantial interaction between artists, curators and arts institutions in both countries. From 1983 bilateral visual arts exchange activities expanded and diversified, particularly in the 1990s. Australia has been considered pivotal in assisting the development of contemporary arts in Malaysia. In this regard personal-professional connections on many levels performed an instrumental, if invisible, role in the realisation of exchange programs. This thesis examines issues of cross-cultural engagement and argues that personal-professional considerations are vital to achieving successful outcomes over a longer term period. While official institutions, such as the Australian High Commission in Malaysia, and other agencies in both countries have also been crucial in cultural exchange programs, the involvement of other non-government agencies and individuals has been particularly significant. In this thesis three case studies examine this nexus of government and non-government participants. The projects discussed demonstrate that although outcomes from artist-to-artist or institution-to-institution exchange may not be immediately apparent, benefits may become evident over an extended period of time. While undeniably more complex, projects that involve collaboration and reciprocity tend to yield successful outcomes and consolidate ongoing partnerships. In turn, such projects can provide models for further exchange activity. While not directly serving diplomatic agendas they may nevertheless benefit official and unofficial bilateral relations. In recent years Australian government policy has shifted regional priorities away from the South East Asian region. Nevertheless, while official cultural relations programs have diminished, many visual arts activities instigated between 1998 and 2001 continue to yield beneficial outcomes. This thesis argues that while limits may exist in government policy, programs and funding, collaborative and reciprocal visual arts exchange activities that involve cross-cultural enquiry and cooperation, supported by personal-professional connections, can affirm a positive Australian presence in the region and strengthen bilateral relationships at official and unofficial levels.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arts</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Malaysia</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24978</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24978</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Raising ghosts post-World War Two European emigre and migrant artists and the evolution of abstract painting in Australia, with special reference to Adelaide ca 1950-1965</field><field name="creator">Dutkiewicz, Adam</field><field name="description">Raising ghosts examines the political and cultural climate in Australia in the mid-20th century, and proposes that e?migre? and migrant artists to a significant extent were the catalysts of change and progenitors of new forms of painting in the post-war years.

The effects of system parameters (step size, power-update rate, feedback delay, SIR measurement error, and command error) on the bit error rate (BER) performance of power control are investigated. Feedback delay is found to be the most critical parameter that causes a serious problem in the loop. To solve this problem, we propose to use a channel prediction technique at the basestation. To further improve the performance of power control, we then propose to use a diversity reception technique using antenna arrays at the basestation. We show that this combination allows solving the problems linked to the use of power control in a real system affected by multiple access interference under fading conditions.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Code division multiple access</field><field name="subject">Mobile communication systems</field><field name="subject">Signal processing</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24961</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24961</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantification of the relationship between fish populations and seagrass</field><field name="creator">McArthur, Lynne Caryn</field><field name="description">Seagrass is an underwater flowering plant that thrives in clear, sheltered, coastal waters around the world.

Confucian values emphasize a way of life. They are based on first cultivating oneself with the basic four virtues highlighted by Confucius (551 - 479 BC). Secondly, through the influence of the individual on others (via the five relationships, namely ruler-subject, father-son, brother-brother, husband-wife and friend-friend illustrated by Confucius), a 'perfect' world with peace and harmony can be created. This study investigates the degree to which the four distinct virtues - 1) human-kindness (ren), 2) integrity (yi), 3) propriety (li) and 4) knowledge (chi) and the five relationships, 1) ruler-subject, 2) father-son, 3) husband-wife, 4) brother-brother and 5) friend-friend, were adopted to underpin the practices of Human Resource Management (HRM) in Singapore. The target group of respondents chosen was executives, who were directly influenced by the style of human resource management in the firm. Electronics/technology related firms based in Singapore were the chosen group. The executives were chosen from electronics/technology related firms because these firms formed the most important industry, responsible for the well being of Singapore's growth (24% of GDP as stated by the Department of Statistics; 1999) and expected to continue so for the next 10 years. Managers from the same firms were given another set of questionnaires to verify the responses obtained from the executives. From the result obtained, it showed that there were influences of Confucian values on the five human resources functions tested. The executives' responses provided evidence on whether or not a certain trait or style has been used in the firm. The managers' responses, on the other hand, helped to verify that the trait or style was due to the influence of Confucian values as a whole and not other cultures or religions. The entire survey and interviews were carried out over twenty months from 1998, during which responses obtainable from both the managers and executives from each firm were analyzed. The data were analyzed using cross-tabulations and chi-square tests because cross-tabulation is one statistical tool which required only at least 5 responses in each cell for a reliable analysis to be conducted (Yong, 1994). Letters were then sent out to the Heads/Managers of the target firms, conducting interviews to obtain more insights to argue the survey data. Two interviews were conducted, taped and results obtained from the quantitative approach, helped further clarify earlier interpretations. This research showed that Singapore-based electronics/technology-related firms, regardless whether they were locally owned or foreign owned, showed that they were influenced by Confucian values in most aspects of the human resource practices. In addition, from the study, it showed that there were no significant differences between locally owned firms and foreign owned firms in terms of the degree of influence Confucian values have on the style of the management. This demonstrated that Chinese culture (in this case - Confucian values) - local/host country's culture played a stronger influence on the style of management in businesses conducted in Singapore than the organization's culture. This finding is important as most past research findings such as Rodrigues (1996) used to state that the organizational culture of the foreign-owned firms often have stronger influence on the practices adopted in firms regardless of the country that they were in.

This is reflected in textual discourse, clinical and service practices, training and education, research approaches and policy development. The research presented in this thesis investigates whether lessons might be drawn from the experience of activists in the United States of America (USA) and then applied to Australian gerontology, with regard to the recognition of GLBTI issues. As such, the research aims to provide guideposts for a process of change in Australia, by the investigation of the factors involved in collective action. A critical research paradigm underpinned the research approach. The research was informed by social movement theory which includes structural and cultural dimensions of collective action. The approach was also informed by the researcher?s history of involvement in activism. Qualitative descriptive research, involving the triangulation of methods, was conducted in Australia and the State of California, in the USA. Fieldwork took place in three phases, involving a questionnaire mailed to Australian activists, analysis of documents held in archival collections in San Francisco and Long Beach, interviews with key activists involved in the Californian process of change and interviews with older GLBTI Australian activists. Throughout the period of the inquiry, the researcher recorded a log of relevant action that occurred in Australia. The data revealed three key findings regarding the Californian process of change and the Australian situation: Aspects of the change process in the State of California, in the USA, involving personal style, individual biography and devotion to the cause, formed a vital personal dimension of collective action; Issues associated with leadership and self-determination were of significance in shaping the change process and determining the outcome of collective action in California; Interest in GLBTI ageing issues and pockets of relevant action were evident in Australia, but a co-ordinated collective process of action was not identified. This thesis argues that lessons drawn from the process of collective action in the State of California could inform action that may take place in Australia. A dialogue between Australian activists, addressing the outcomes of this research, could also assist the development of a locally appropriate process of change. The thesis reveals implications and challenges for the aged care industry, in relation to service provision, education and training, policy development, and further research. The research provides a contribution to the discussion of matters which could assist to minimise discrimination, alleviate fear, promote equity and enhance the value of diversity in Australian gerontology in the future.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gerontology</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Middle aged gays</field><field name="subject">Older gays</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24955</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24955</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formal specification of the TCP service and verification of TCP connection management</field><field name="creator">Han, Bing</field><field name="description">Using the approach of Coloured Petri nets (CPNs) and automata theory, this thesis shows how to formalise the service provided by the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and verify TCP Connection Management, an essential part of TCP.

Consequently, effective removal of these metabolites from drinking water is paramount. The combination of ozone (O3) and granular activated carbon (GAC) has been shown to be effective for the removal of these metabolites from drinking water. In this study, the ozonation of MIB and geosmin was affected by the character of natural organic material (NOM). In particular, NOM containing compounds of high UV absorbing properties and high molecular weight (MW) resulted in greater destruction of MIB and geosmin due to the formation of hydroxyl (OH) radicals. In addition, alkalinity also affected the ozonation process, with waters containing higher alkalinity resulting in decreased destruction of MIB and geosmin. Laboratory scale minicolumn experiments, coupled with the homogenous surface diffusion model (HSDM), were found to be ineffective in predicting the GAC breakthrough behaviour of MIB and microcystin at two different pilot plants. This can be attributed to the biological degradation of the metabolites at the pilot plants which cannot be modelled by the HSDM. In addition, the volume of GAC used in the minicolumn experiments may not have been appropriate for the predictions, rather, larger laboratory scale columns were found to be more applicable in mimicking pilot plant results. Microcystins were shown to be readily degraded by the bacteria attached to the GAC. Furthermore, the lag period prior to the onset of degradation, which is indicative of most biological degradation studies, was effectively eliminated and in one instance abated. This finding suggests that biological filtration of microcystin is practically feasible especially since the occurrence of microcystins in water supplies is seasonal. This study expands on previous research in the area of O3 and GAC for the treatment of MIB, geosmin and microcystin. With the imminent increase of the use of O3 and GAC in Australian water treatment plants (WTPs), this study provides valuable information for the use of these processes both alone and in combination, particularly since minimal research in this area has been conducted in Australia.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drinking water</field><field name="subject">Purification</field><field name="subject">Cyanobacteria</field><field name="subject">Water</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24958</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24958</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mutagenic and purification studies of the carboxyl tail of ClC-1, the skeletal muscle chloride channel</field><field name="creator">Simpson, Bronwyn Jayne</field><field name="description">ClC-1 is the major skeletal muscle chloride channel and is essential for re-establishing the resting membrane potential of muscle cells after an action potential has occurred.

The developers, the Mawson Lakes Joint Venture (MLJV), and the local council, the City of Salisbury, intend to capture all stormwater entering the site and recondition all wastewater. The water will then be supplied to residents and businesses for non-potable usage. Modelling the behaviour of the Mawson Lakes catchment under extreme conditions such as drought and prolonged periods of high rainfall will allow the project team to determine optimal water management strategies for the catchment. One of the problems facing the team is the prediction of future rainfall patterns and the typical form of extreme events. In this thesis I have used historical records to construct synthetic rainfall data that will allow the project team to investigate a wide range of typical behaviour. The Gamma distribution has been widely used to approximate the probability density function (PDF) of monthly rainfall totals. However, there is no natural way to extend this method directly to obtain a joint PDF for rainfall densities associated with two or more months, unless the monthly totals are independent. I propose a modified method to construct a suitable PDF using parameters from the maximum likelihood estimate for a marginal Gamma distribution and a series of associated Laguerre polynomials. This series of special functions allows us to match the correlation between monthly totals and to match the observed moments with any level of precision needed. The joint PDF for two months is constructed using a sum of products of associated Laguerre polynomials. In order to get an analytic expression for the marginal distributions and the associated cumulative probabilities, it is convenient to use a weighted total and a weighted proportion contributed from the first month. The method makes extensive use of well-known formulae from the theory of special functions. The cumulative marginal probability density for the weighted total and the cumulative conditional probability density for the weighted proportion are used to generate simulated rainfall totals for each month in a two month period. In theory the simulated data is statistically identical to the observed data. In practice we apply standard statistical methods to check that the simulated data is consistent with the observed data. This method can be extended to the general case of any number of months, but computationally is restricted to only three. For this reason an alternative method is proposed to generate synthetic data for more than three months, which uses groups and subgroups of months, but still retains the characteristics of the original PDF. Although the series method could also be used to model a sequence of days, I propose an alternative method using Markov processes. This method will match a sequence of daily totals, generated from a probability transition matrix, to the monthly total generated by the series method. This methodology allows the research team to simulate certain special cases such as droughts and prolonged periods of high rainfall. These unusual events are of great interest in catchment planning and management.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Algorithms</field><field name="subject">Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Rain and rainfall</field><field name="subject">Statistical methods</field><field name="subject">South Australia</field><field name="subject">Stochastic methods</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24949</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24949</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrating spirituality, occupation, and mental illness a journey through life of meaningful being and doing</field><field name="creator">Wilding, Clare</field><field name="description">The aim of this qualitative research project was to investigate the phenomenon of spirituality within occupation as encountered by six people who have all experienced mental illness. A Heideggerian phenomenological philosophy was utilised as the theoretical background. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews with each participant, which were transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using a hermeneutic, circular process. Eight themes arose from the investigation. Firstly, the experience of spirituality is diverse and each person has his or her idiosyncratic understanding of what spirituality is. Secondly, spirituality is experienced as a journey that changes across time. The third theme notes that spirituality is vitally important to the study participants, so much so, that participants??? spirituality saved them from suicide and filled their lives with meaning and purpose. The fourth theme is recognition that there are ???spiritual occupations??? that are designed to directly access one???s spirituality. Fifth is that spirituality is a form of being which provides the meaning to purposeful doing and that therefore spirituality can make even ???ordinary??? occupation spiritually meaningful. Theme six is that spirituality is not only important on an individual level, but that social and community dimensions of spirituality are also essential. Theme seven finds that mental illness provided the ???wake-up message??? that ???called??? each participant to a spiritual life. The final theme is that spirituality helps the participants cope with living with mental illness. The thesis concludes that spirituality is an indispensable part of each participant???s life. Spirituality has both irrevocably changed participants??? lives and allowed them find personal meaning in their lives that is life-sustaining and life-enhancing. The findings also reveal that spirituality can be related to occupation both theoretically and practically. Given that spirituality was found to be life-saving and life-sustaining and that it can be conceptualised as an essential dimension of occupation, it is argued that spirituality is an issue of high importance to occupational therapists. However, since some occupational therapists may not feel comfortable or knowledgeable enough to discuss spirituality in practice (Collins, Paul and West-Frasier 2001; McColl 2000) it is noted that this topic area forms an emergent frontier for occupational therapy. As a pioneer area of practice, further research and investigation into this fascinating and mysterious realm is recommended.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en-aus</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mental illness</field><field name="subject">Occupational therapy</field><field name="subject">Spiritual life</field><field name="subject">Spirituality</field><field name="subject">Mental health</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24946</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24946</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of acid rock drainage prediction methodologies for coal mine wastes</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Warwick</field><field name="description">Acid rock drainage (ARD) is recognised as one of the most serious environmental issues currently facing the mining industry.

Consequences to inpatient aggression are profound, impacting on staff and patients, ward milieu and regime, and mental health services in general. Despite considerable research, which has primarily focussed on the assessment of demographic and clinical characteristics of aggressive patients, the nature of the relationship between mental illness, inpatient treatment and aggression remains unclear. Inconsistent risk assessment practices, management strategies and treatment plans, often derived from idiosyncratic beliefs about the causes of aggression, follow. Approaches to the assessment of inpatient aggression have been categorised as structural, which emphasise form, or functional, which emphasise purpose. Studies of inpatient aggression have primarily utilized a structural approach. These studies have resulted in the identification of demographic, clinical and situational characteristics of high-risk patients and environments. Resource allocation and actuarial assessments of risk have been assisted by this research. Conversely, functional assessment approaches seek to clarify the factors responsible for the development, expression and maintenance of inpatient aggression by examining predisposing characteristics, in addition to the proximal antecedents and consequences of aggressive behaviours. While functional analysis has demonstrated efficacy in assessing and prescribing interventions for other problem behaviours, and has been regarded a legitimate assessment approach for anger management problems, psychiatric inpatient aggression has been relatively neglected by functional analysis. Against this background, four studies focussing on the assessment of predisposing characteristics, precipitants and consequences, and purposes of aggressive behaviour, were undertaken to assist in the development of a functional analysis of psychiatric inpatient aggression. All four studies were conducted within the Thomas Embling Hospital (TEH), a secure forensic psychiatric hospital in Melbourne, Australia. The first of three initial studies involved a retrospective review of Incident Forms relating to aggressive behaviours that occurred within the first year of the hospital?s operation. The second involved a comparison of prospective assessment of aggressive behaviours with retrospective review of Incident Forms. The third involved a review of Incident Forms across two forensic psychiatric hospitals, the Rosanna Forensic Psychiatric Centre, and the TEH, to allow for the study of environmental contributors to aggression. The fourth, and main study, focussed on the assessment of patients and aggressive incidents, using a framework emphasising purpose, which was assessed using a classification system designed and validated as part of this study. Demographic and clinical information in addition to social behaviour, history of aggression and substance use were collected on the 204 patients admitted to the hospital during 2002. One hundred and ten of these patients completed an additional assessment of psychotic symptoms in addition to a battery of psychological tests measuring anger expression and control, assertiveness, and impulsivity. During 2002, the year under review, there were 502 incidents of verbal aggression, physical aggression, and property damage recorded. Staff members who observed these incidents were interviewed, and files were reviewed to record the severity, type, direction and purpose of aggression. Following 71 aggressive behaviours patients also participated in the assessment of purpose. Results from this, and the three initial studies, reinforced the contribution to aggression of a number of individual characteristics, including a recent history of substance use, an entrenched history of aggression, a recent history of antisocial behaviour, and symptoms of psychosis, including thought disturbance, auditory hallucinations and conceptual disorganisation. Somewhat surprisingly, a number of other characteristics shown through previous research to have a relationship with aggression, including anger arousal and control, impulsivity, and assertiveness did not show a relationship with aggression. Further, and perhaps a consequence of the peculiar characteristics of some patients admitted to the TEH, older patients and females were more likely to be repeatedly aggressive, yet neither age nor gender differentiated aggressive from non-aggressive inpatients. In this study acts of inpatient aggression were usually precipitated by discernible events, or motivated by rational purposes. Rarely was aggression the consequence of a spontaneous manifestation of underlying psychopathology occurring in isolation from environmental precipitants. A number of proximal environmental factors, most particularly staff-patient interactions associated with treatment or maintenance of ward regime, that were considered provocative or that threatened status, were evident in incidents of aggression perpetrated against staff. The perception of provocation and the need to enhance status were common precipitants of aggression between patients. There was little evidence to suggest that aggression was used instrumentally to obtain tangible items, to reduce social isolation, or to observe the suffering of others in the absence of provocation. Results of these four studies have implications for the prediction and prevention of inpatient aggression, and for the treatment of aggressive inpatients. These are discussed, as are the limitations of this research and suggestions for further research.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mental health personnel and patient</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">Psychiatric nursing</field><field name="subject">Violence in hospitals</field><field name="subject">Medical personnel</field><field name="subject">Violence against</field><field name="subject">Aggressiveness</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24968</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24968</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Brand loyalty in subscription markets: is it possible to out-perform competitors?"</field><field name="creator">Mundt, Kerry</field><field name="description">The thesis extends previous loyalty research by comparing the performance of brands in subscription markets, specifically financial services and insurance, on a cross-category basis.

Nevertheless, in the 1996 World Solar Challenge the Honda Dream carried two people 3000km across Australia at an average speed of 90km/h, powered only by sunlight. You clearly don?t need a 2500kg machine powered by polluting fuels to get you to work and back each day. The Australian Aurora 101 solar powered car requires less than 2000W of power to travel at 100km/h. To achieve such high performance the car has high aerodynamic efficiency, motor efficiency greater than 98%, low rolling resistance tyres, and weighs less than 280kg with the driver in it. The energy used to propel the car is generated by high-efficiency photovoltaic cells Another key to achieving high performance is efficient energy management. The car has a small battery that can store enough energy to drive the car about 250km at 100km/h. Energy stored in the battery can be used when extra power is required for climbing hills or for driving under clouds. More importantly, energy stored while the car is not racing can be used to increase the average speed of the car. How should the battery be used? The motivation for this problem was to develop an energy management strategy for the Aurora solar racing team to use in the World Solar Challenge, a triennial race across Australia from Darwin to Adelaide. The real problem? with weather prediction, detailed models of the car and numerous race constraints?is intractable. But by studying several simplified problems it is possible to discover simple rules for an efficient energy management strategy. The simplest problem is to find a strategy that minimises the energy required to drive a car with a perfectly efficient battery and a constant drive efficiency. The optimal strategy is to drive at a constant speed. This is just the beginning of the solar car problem, however. More general problems, with more general models for the battery, drive system and solar power, can be formulated as optimal control problems, where the control is (usually) the flow of power from or to the battery. By forming a Hamiltonian function we can use Pontryagin?s Maximum Principle to derive necessary conditions for an optimal strategy. We then use these conditions to construct an optimal strategy. The strategies for the various simplified problems are similar: ? On a level road, with solar power a known function of time, and with a perfectly efficient drive system and battery, the optimal strategy has three driving modes: maximum power, speed holding, and maximum regenerative braking. ? If the perfectly efficient battery is replaced by a battery with constant energy efficiency then the single holding speed is replaced by two critical speeds. The lower speed is held when solar power is low, and the upper speed is held when solar power is high. The battery discharges at the lower speed and charges at the higher speed. The difference between the upper and lower critical speeds is about 10km/h. There are precise conditions for switching from one mode to another, but small switching errors do not have a significant effect on the journey. ? If we now change from a level road to an undulating road, the optimal strategy still has two critical speeds. With hills, however, the conditions for switching between driving modes are more complex. Steep gradients must be anticipated. For steep inclines the control should be switched to power before the incline so that speed increases before the incline and drops while the car is on the incline. Similarly, for steep declines the speed of the car should be allowed to drop before the decline and increase on the decline. ? With more realistic battery models the optimal control is continuous rather than discrete. The optimal strategy is found by following an optimal trajectory in the phase space of the state and adjoint equations. This optimal trajectory is very close to a critical point of the phase space for most of the journey. Speed increases slightly with solar power. As before, the optimal speed lies within a narrow range for most of the journey. ? Power losses in the drive system affect the initial power phase, the final regenerative braking phase, and the speed profile over hills. The optimal speed still lies within a narrow range for most of the journey. ? With spatial variations in solar power it is possible to vary the speed of the car in such a way that the extra energy collected more than compensates for the extra energy used. Speed should be increased under clouds, and decreased in bright sunlight. The benefits of ?sun-chasing? are small, however. ? Solar power is not known in advance. By modelling solar power as a Markov process we can use dynamic programming to determine the target distance for each remaining day of the race. Alternatively, we can calculate the probability of completing the race at any given speed. These principles of efficient control have been used successfully since 1993 to develop practical strategy calculations for the Aurora solar racing team, winner of the 1999 World Solar Challenge.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Solar engines</field><field name="subject">Solar cars</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24969</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24969</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into strategies affecting the long-term performance of Chinese chemical companies</field><field name="creator">Cheng, Jeremy</field><field name="description">China has been changing from a centrally planned to a market economy. Its journey has not been a smooth one and is not likely to be easy in the years to come. One of its industry sectors, the chemical industry, which represents approximately 4.6% of its national GDP, is facing challenges in the changing market dynamics. The Chinese government has applied administrative actions rather than simply relying on the market to address these challenges. Fragmentation has been reduced by closing down inefficient chemical plants; merging various companies to form groups. It has also attempted to privatise government owned enterprises by corporatisation and marketisation. Corporatisation of government-owned enterprise refers to alteration of their ownership to create joint stock companies. Marketisation refers to listing those privatised enterprises on the stock market.

Techniques such as MIMO and turbo-coded CDMA are well known and obvious candidates for improving the spectral efficiency of next-generation wireless networks, and addressing the limitations of currently implemented technologies. Correspondingly, such methods are finding their way into wireless network standards such as 3GPP and IEEE 802.20. One measure of the size of a communication system is the number of independent data streams being transmitted simultaneously through a channel, assuming tight constraints on available bandwidth and signal power. Such data streams may originate from different users all wishing to communicate at once. In addition, each user may wish to transmit independent data on more than one antenna simultaneously in order to increase his or her own data rate. Although strategies for such multi-dimensional signalling have seen significant improvements in recent years, most of the techniques proposed in the literature still suffer from either poor performance or prohibitive complexity when the size of the system grows large. This thesis is concerned primarily with supporting high systemspectral-efficiencies in very large systems, while maintaining strong resistance to data errors with manageable complexity.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems</field><field name="subject">Spread spectrum communications</field><field name="subject">Iterative methods (Mathematics)</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24984</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24984</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Policing and practising subjectivities poor and working class young women and girls and Australian government mutual obligations policies</field><field name="creator">Edwards, Janet Kay</field><field name="description">Australian government Mutual Obligations welfare policies, key features of contemporary Australian welfare reforms are the focus of this study.

A notion that there are possibilities for challenge and resistance by social work practitioners to the power of cultural pedagogy that is inherent in the discursive field of social work is articulated.

They are unable to obtain any guidance from the pricing or relationship marketing literature. These works are either too complex or too general to be of any use to industry members. Consequently, much of industry strategy and practice occurs without the benefit of theory. UUThe Method An extensive review of existing literature was conducted in the major subject areas of pricing and relationship marketing. Literature on other subjects of channels, marketing mix, strategy, value, commitment, trust, cooperation, and satisfaction were also reviewed. A survey instrument was developed and field research was administered to 35 channel members of the industry. The results were analysed using SPSS 11. The results were used to construct a model of the role of pricing in relationship marketing. The model was constructed using Factor Analysis, Correlation Analysis and Regression Analysis. UUThe Findings The findings are all based on the perception of the channel members. Nine factors were extracted. These non-trivial factors to the Singapore Heavy Equipment Spare Parts Industry are: - Downstream supply considerations; - Product/Stock allocations; - Price gap resolution; - Perception of value/profitability; - Business volume; - Intermediate business relationships; - Leads and referrals; - Favourable pricing; and - Long-run relationships. At 5% significance (2-tailed), 4 construct paths were supported. These are: - Support gap correlates with actual price; - Support gap correlates with value; - Support gap correlates with price gap; and - Price gap correlates with value. At 5% significance (2-tailed), 8 hypotheses were supported. These are: - Price gap resolution correlates with commitment; - Price gap resolution correlates with cooperation; - Price gap resolution correlates with satisfaction; - Importance of constructive acts correlates with improved business volume; - Expression of intention to increase business correlates with increased business; - Importance of value correlates with increased business; - Value (through profitability) correlates with increased business; and - Importance of value correlates with improvements in: - Trust; - Commitment; - Cooperation; - Satisfaction; and - Increased business. UUConclusion Pricing has a profound and multi-faceted role in relationship marketing. It is a powerful tool. It has a role as a market tool with new relationships, as a development tool in the growth phase of relationships, and as a control tool in the mature phase of bilateral relationships between first and second echelon distributors. The study recommended that channel members utilise this tool concept and the management of value, price, and support gap in relational exchanges.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Construction equipment inustry</field><field name="subject">Singapore</field><field name="subject">Pricing</field><field name="subject">Relationship marketing</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24937</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24937</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rapid detection and molecular profiling of water-borne bacteria</field><field name="creator">Hoefel, Daniel</field><field name="description">In this thesis, detection of active water-borne bacteria was achieved by combining flow cytometry with vital dyes that characterise the metabolic status of cells.

Shigella flexneri type 2a in particular is responsible for the majority of incidents in developing countries. The S. flexneri protease IcsP, is a member of the Omptin family of outer membrane (OM) proteases which cleaves IcsA, a polarly localised OM protein required for Shigella virulence. Mutations in icsP have been shown to effect the observed distribution of IcsA, however the significance of IcsP in Shigella virulence is incompletely understood. In this study, aspects of IcsP biology were investigated. S. flexneri 2457T and M90T icsP mutants were constructed to investigate the role of IcsP in Shigella intercellular spread, and it was found that icsP in both S. flexneri backgrounds did not appear to be essential for cell-tocell spread in human cervical cancer HeLa cells, but enhanced cell-to-cell spread in monkey kidney CV-1 cells (as determined by plaque assays). Complementation with icsP returned the mutant phenotype to wild-type. The results suggest IcsP does play a role in Shigella intercellular spread. The 2457T icsP mutant was subsequently complemented with an altered icsP gene encoding a haemagglutinin epitope tagged IcsP (IcsPHA) to determine the distribution of IcsP on the cell surface. In both S. flexneri and E. coli K-12 possessing smooth and rough lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the distribution of IcsPHA was found to be punctate across the cell surface. Deconvolution analysis revealed that IcsP distribution was punctate and banded in both LPS backgrounds. A smooth LPS E. coli K-12 yfdI mutant strain expressing IcsPHA was also constructed, and experiments involving treatment of this strain with bacteriophage Sf6 tail spike protein suggested that LPS O antigen chains masked IcsP in smooth LPS strains. During these studies, double-labelling of IcsPHA and LPS in a S. flexneri 5a M90T strain revealed a helical distribution of LPS in this strain. Overall, the results suggest IcsP has a punctate, banded distribution across the cell surface. The effect of virK and rmlD mutations on IcsP was then investigated by constructing a virK, rmlD and virK/rmlD double mutant in S. flexneri 2457T. Western immunoblotting showed no change in IcsP expression levels in either the virK, rmlD or virK/rmlD mutants compared to wild-type. Surprisingly, the virK mutant showed no change in IcsA expression levels by Western immunoblotting and plaque assays (using HeLa and CV-1 cells) suggested that virK was not essential for Shigella intercellular spread (contradicting the published data on this gene). No effect was also observed on IcsP expression level or on IcsP&#8217;s ability to cleave IcsA into culture supernatants. Finally alternative substrates for the protease activity of IcsP were investigated against known Omptin substrates (plasminogen, &#945;2-antiplasmin, complement, protamine and colicins). However, IcsP appeared to have no effect on these substrates as determined by proteolytic cleavage assays and antimicrobial assay. Interestingly, Plg cleavage by rough LPS S. flexneri, and &#945;2AP cleavage by both smooth and rough LPS S. flexneri, was observed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shigella flexneri; IcsP; Outer membrane; Protease</field><field name="subject">Shigella flexneri Molecular genetics.

Although ninety five per cent of the 13,000 cases filed annually are resolved in the &#8220;conciliatory arm&#8221; of the Court, the remaining five per cent require judicial determination. Of those, a large number return to court, showing that the outcomes in these difficult cases are of poor quality, despite their disproportional use of resources. It is often suggested that the root cause of quality and resourcing problems lies in the characteristics of adversarial litigation. A procedural innovation that addressed these issues was recently trialed.  The &#8220;Parenting Hearings Programme&#8221; (PHP) promises a less adversarial and more child focused process, achieved by changing the judge's role. The judge, not the parties, determines the relevant issues and the scope and nature of the evidential process. Judges apply mediative and adjudicative interventions in a &#8220;hybrid&#8221; process with &#8220;inquisitorial&#8221; characteristics.  This thesis discusses the social and legal context of parenting disputes and evaluates the PHP from different perspectives, including comparative law, conflict theory, alternative dispute resolution (ADR) methodology, natural justice, and compliance with court rules. The empirical component includes the results from a survey of family lawyers.  While my findings confirm the potential disadvantages of adversarial litigation, the principles and procedures that constitute the PHP are not endorsed. Conflict- and ADR theory unearth serious shortcomings in the PHP concept. Comparison with a truly inquisitorial system suggests that changing the nature of some aspects of the court process has little prospect of sustained success. The innovation is arguably outside the rules and rule making powers of the Family Court, and it is doubted whether the PHP complies with fundamental tenets of the New Zealand justice system.  The pilot process is found to have been lacking in methodology and execution, and the PHP innovation has not achieved the required level of endorsement and support from the legal profession.  This study suggests a focus on improving the operational efficiency and resourcing of the Family Courts, rather than continued engagement in innovative experiments that ultimately fail to improve accessibility and quality of justice.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5764</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A multi-scale computational model of fluid transport in the human bronchial ariways</field><field name="creator">Warren, Nicholas J.</field><field name="description">Mucociliary transport provides the airways' vanguard of defence against inspired noxious  materials. Without adequate hydration of the thin layer of liquid that lines the airways,  mucociliary transport would cease, leading to build up of mucus and the development of  infection. Within this thesis a multi-scale computational model was used to investigate the  fluid transport within the airways which is necessary for maintenance of the mucociliary  transport system.  A mathematical description of the fluid secretion elicited by a rise in [Ca2+]i from a single  airway epithelial cell was developed. The model indicates that apical membrane Ca2+ activated  Cl- channels are not required for Ca2+ induced fluid secretion. It was shown that  when [Ca2+]i followed an oscillatory profile the resulting fluid secretion displayed different  properties to when the model stimulated a tonic rise in [Ca2+]i due to saturation of the Ca2+  gated ion channels. Furthermore, consistent with known physiology, cell volume returned  to equilibrium more rapidly after a hypotonic challenge when Ca2+ gated ion channels were  activated by a rise in [Ca2+]i.  A description of intercellular Ca2+ signalling was developed and used to investigate the  relative roles of IP3 and ATP diffusion in mediating [Ca2+]i waves in airway epithelial tissue.  It was shown that for greater amounts of released ATP, there is a diminishing return in the  radius of [Ca2+]i wave propagation. In addition to this, the radial profile of maximal [Ca2+]i  response from the stimulated cell does not match the flat profile seen in experimental studies.  This suggests that for [Ca2+]i waves to propagate large distances an additional mechanism  such as regenerative release of ATP from cells down stream of the stimulated cell may be  important.  The epithelial cell model was incorporated into a geometric representation of the human  conducting airways. This &#8220;cell to organ&#8221; coupling was used to investigate the transport of  water and heat within the airways. The current work indicates that energy neutrality on  its own is an unsatisfactory metric of inspired air's temperature and humidity for invasive  mechanical ventilation and can lead to airway dehydration. It was shown that with inspiration  of air significantly above body core temperature, a redistribution of airway surface liquid  can theoretically occur. This condition represents an extreme which is unlikely to occur  clinically, and suggests that mild heating of the air within the ventilator circuit would not  cause mucociliary transport dysfunction.  The model presented here provides a firm platform for further study of pathological conditions,  such as cystic fibrosis, which lead to mucociliary failure.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5773</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Totara Valley micro-hydro development : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Renewable Energy Engineering, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, David Ronald</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the design, construction and operation of a distributed generation system based on micro-hydro technology. The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who talks, what they talk about, and how much they say : a study of bulletin structure and source use in New Zealand free-to-air television news programmes : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management in Communication Management, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Macdonald, Julie Susan</field><field name="description">Free-to-air television news is an accessible and popular means through which audiences can gain knowledge and understanding about the world. Therefore, the nature of the news provided has important implications for the opportunities audiences have to become informed about events and issues, and to use this knowledge to participate in social decision-making. The structure and content of news bulletins reflect the decisions made by broadcasters about the topics that are considered to be important, and which sources should have the opportunity to be represented. Thus, the goal of this research was to compare the structure and content of the news provided by New Zealand&#8217;s national free-to-air news programmes; ONE News (TVNZ), 3 News (TV3), Prime News (Prime Television), and Te K ea (M ori Television). A content analysis of one constructed week of the four news programmes was undertaken, focusing on four general areas of interest. First, the profile of the news bulletins was examined (i.e., the proportion of the bulletin allocated to different segments of the news, the duration of main news stories, the origin of production of main news stories, the proportion of New Zealand and international news, and the topics included in the news). Second, the research investigated the identity of the types of sources selected by the broadcasters for inclusion in locally produced main news stories. Third, the frequency and duration of &#233;lite and non-&#233;lite source speech was examined. Finally, the extent to which journalists speak on camera in news stories was also investigated. The study showed that the four programmes generally conformed to the &#8216;standard profile&#8217; of modern television news bulletins; the programmes included considerable amounts of non-news content and the news topics often reflected entertainment values, rather than focusing on serious issues. A further significant characteristic of the bulletins was that &#233;lite sources were more likely to be included in news stories on all programmes and generally had greater opportunities to speak. However, in many respects it appears that Te K ea provides an alternative news bulletin compared to the other three channels, by focusing on a wider range of news topics, including more non-&#233;lite sources in stories, and giving all sources considerably more time to share their views. Te K ea seems to broadcast a news programme that makes a compromise between the entertainment values which are entrenched in contemporary television news, and the broader M ori Television mandate to inform and educate the public. This contrasts with the more homogenous (in terms of the characteristics examined in this research) news programmes offered by the ONE News, 3 News, and Prime News. This study concludes that the nationally available free-to-air news programmes currently broadcast on New Zealand television fulfil the traditional news functions of informing and educating the public in only a very narrow sense. The deregulated news environment is poised to undergo further transformation with an anticipated increase in convergence among news media and the emergence of more television news providers. The challenge within this commercial environment is for ONE News, 3 News, Prime News, and Te K ea to deliver on their stated commitments to provide information and promote debate on the important issues of the day.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">news bulletins</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">public broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rheo-NMR studies of macromolecules : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Physics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kakubayashi, Motoko</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the effects of simple shear flow on macromolecular structure and interactions are investigated in detail via a combination of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and rheology, namely Rheo-NMR. A specially designed NMR couette shear cell and benchtop shear cell, developed in-house, demonstrated that the direct measurement of the above phenomena is possible. First, to determine whether the shear cells were creating simple shear flow, results were reproduced from literature studies of liquid crystal systems which report shear effects on: Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) in deuterium oxide, and Poly(gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PBLG) in m-cresol. Next, the possible conformational changes to protein structure brought about by shear were investigated by applying shear to Bovine  -lactogobulin ( -Lg). As the protein was sheared, a small, irreversible conformational change was observed by means of one-dimensional and two-dimensional 1H NMR with reasonable reproducibility. However, no observable change was detected by means of light scattering. A large conformational change was observed after shearing a destabilized  -Lg sample containing 10% Trifluoroethanol (TFE) (v/v). From an NMR point of view, the sheared state was similar to the structure of  -Lg containing large amounts of  -helices and, interestingly, similar to the structure of  -Lg containing  -sheet amyloid fibrils. Gel electrophoresis tests suggested that the changes were caused by hydrophobic interactions. Unfortunately, this proved to be difficult to reproduce. The effect of shear on an inter-macromolecular interaction was investigated by applying shear during an enzyme reaction of pectin methylesterase (PME) on pectin. Experimental method and analysis developments are described in detail. It was observed that under the conditions studied, shear does not interfere with the de-esterification of pectin with two types of PME, which have different action mechanisms at average shear rates up to 1570 s-1.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">macromolecular structure</field><field name="subject">shear</field><field name="subject">pectin</field><field name="subject">protein interactions</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240300 Atomic and Molecular Physics; Nuclear and Particle Physics, Plasma Physics::240301 Atomic and molecular physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accelerating classifier training using AdaBoost within cascades of boosted ensembles : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Sciences at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Susnjak, Teo</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to address current problems encountered when training classifiers within the framework of cascades of boosted ensembles (CoBE). At present, a signifi- cant challenge facing this framework are inordinate classifier training runtimes. In some cases, it can take days or weeks (Viola and Jones, 2004; Verschae et al., 2008) to train a classifier. The protracted training runtimes are an obstacle to the wider use of this framework (Brubaker et al., 2006). They also hinder the process of producing effective object detection applications and make the testing of new theories and algorithms, as well as verifications of others research, a considerable challenge (McCane and Novins, 2003). An additional shortcoming of the CoBE framework is its limited ability to train clas- sifiers incrementally. Presently, the most reliable method of integrating new dataset in- formation into an existing classifier, is to re-train a classifier from beginning using the combined new and old datasets. This process is inefficient. It lacks scalability and dis- cards valuable information learned in previous training. To deal with these challenges, this thesis extends on the research by Barczak et al. (2008), and presents alternative CoBE frameworks for training classifiers. The alterna- tive frameworks reduce training runtimes by an order of magnitude over common CoBE frameworks and introduce additional tractability to the process. They achieve this, while preserving the generalization ability of their classifiers. This research also introduces a new framework for incrementally training CoBE clas- sifiers and shows how this can be done without re-training classifiers from beginning. However, the incremental framework for CoBEs has some limitations. Although it is able to improve the positive detection rates of existing classifiers, currently it is unable to lower their false detection rates.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CoBE framework</field><field name="subject">classifiers</field><field name="subject">classification algorithms</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280212 Neural networks, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The physiological and molecular response to repeated sprints in male and female team-sport athletes : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Sport and Exercise Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Dent, Jessica</field><field name="description">Background: Due to the unique demands of the sport, athletes playing football perform a variety of differing training methods to improve physiological performance. These include strength, endurance and sprint training. While the effects of strength and endurance training have been well researched, the effects of repeated-sprint training on blood and muscle variables in well trained males and females are not well known. An understanding of changes to the blood and muscle during and following an exercise bout are important, so to gain an understanding of the type of stress and resulting adaptations that may occur. Also, while a large volume of research in training adaptations has been performed on males; little has been done on females. To date, some research indicates metabolism during moderateintensity exercise may differ between males and females; however, no study has compared repeated-sprint exercise. Therefore, it is unclear as to whether males and females would have a differing physiological response to repeated-sprint training. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a repeated-sprint bout on molecular signalling in muscle and blood measures and heart rate in well-trained footballers. Additionally, we compared running times and sprint decrement (%). Research Design: Eight female senior University football players (Mean &#177; SD, age, 19 &#177; 1 y, VO ? 2peak 53.0 &#177; 5.1 ml&#183;kg-1min-1) and seven male senior University football players (Mean &#177; SD, age, 19 &#177; 3 y, VO ? 2peak 59.0 &#177; 6.6 ml&#183;kg-1min-1) volunteered to participate in this study. Participants performed four bouts of 6 x 30 m maximal sprints spread equally over a 40 min period. Sprint time was measured (at 30 m) for each sprint and sprint decrement was also calculated for all bouts. Muscle biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis muscle at rest, 15 min following exercise and 2 h into recovery. Venous blood samples were taken at the same time points as the biopsies while capillary blood lactate was measured at rest and 3 min following each sprint bout. Repeated measures ANOVA and Post hoc t-tests were performed to determine significant differences between the two groups (male vs. female) and time points. Findings: Both groups had a significant (P&lt;0.05) increase in blood lactate (mM) after the first bout of repeated sprints, with no differences between females (pre 0.9 &#177; 0.4 mM &#8211; post 10.0 &#177; 1.6 mM) and males (pre 0.8 &#177; 0.3 mM &#8211; post 10.0 &#177; 3.5 mM). Blood lactate remained elevated compared to rest (P&lt;0.05) following bouts 2, 3 and 4 for both females (12.0 &#177; 3.6, 12.0 &#177; 3.3, 12.2 &#177; 3.8 mM respectively) and males (11.9 &#177; 2.9, 11.6 &#177; 2.3, 11.5 &#177; 4.0 mM respectively), with no differences between groups or time points (P&gt;0.05). There were no differences (P&gt;0.05) between the female and male athletes in mean heart rate attained at the end of each bout of repeated sprints (187 &#177; 2 v 190 &#177; 2 bpm respectively) or during recovery between sprints (140 &#177; 2 v 130 &#177; 2 bpm respectively). There were no differences between groups or time points in blood insulin (P&gt;0.05). Fastest 30 m sprint time and mean 30 m sprint time during the repeated-sprint bout was faster for the males than females (4.58 &#177; 0.12 v 5.26 &#177; 0.27 s respectively; (P&gt;0.05)). However, there were no differences in running velocity during the sprints between the males and females (165 &#177; 0.4 % vs. 155 &#177; 0.05 %; P&gt;0.05) when expressed relative to velocity at VO ? 2peak (vVO ? 2peak). Also, mean % decrement during the repeated-sprint bout was lower in the males then females (4.9 &#177; 1.3 v 7.1 &#177; 1.9 % respectively; P&lt;0.05). No changes were observed in total or phosphorylated Akt at any time-point or between genders. However, while total 4E-BP1 was lower, the ratio of total to phosphoryalated 4E-BP1 at rest was greater in males than females (P&lt;0.05). Finally, there was also a significant decrease in 4E-BP1 phosphorylation post-exercise in males (P&lt;0.05), but not females. Conclusions: There were no sex differences in blood lactate or heart rate throughout the repeated-sprint bout. These findings suggest that there were no cardio respiratory or lactate production/clearance differences in the response to a repeated-sprint-training bout between sexes. However, while males were faster than their female counterparts, the average relative speed was similar between sexes, suggesting a similar relative volume of work was performed during the sprint bouts. However, the females did have a greater decrement in sprint performance indicating a greater ability to recover sprint performance in the males. Sex differences in resting total and phosphorylated 4E-BP1 may indicate greater potential for muscle growth in the male athletes during basal conditions. However, differences could be due to factors other than sex, including previous training history. There was a lack of change in plasma insulin or Akt, but, similar to resistance exercise, a significant decrease in post-exercise 4E-BP1 phosphorylation for the males, but not females. The sex differences in the 4E-BP1 phosphorylation response post-exercise could be due to differences in the metabolic disturbance in the muscle during and following maximal sprints.

To date there has only been two published studies that have used New Zealand relevant ethnic groups when analysing whether personality measures used in pre-employment settings exhibit different mean scores. The present thesis performed a systematic evaluation on the impact of ethnicity on personality traits. The study examined the impact of ethnicity on NZ Army Officer applicant personality assessment scores measured by the EPQ-R and GPP-I. Four ethnic groups (NZ Europeans, M&#226;ori, Pasifika, and Asian) were analysed for mean trait score differences among ethnic groups, the stability of these differences across different personality inventories and models, the variance of personality traits, the impact of ethnicity on age and gender relationships with personality traits, and how these differences were related to employment selection outcomes. The analyses revealed that ethnicity did have some impact on mean personality assessment scores used in the study. However, these were mostly small differences among ethnic groups. In addition, most of these differences found on the EPQ-R and the GPP-I were not consistent across inventories and models. There were no significant variance differences found on personality traits among ethnic groups. While initial analysis suggested that ethnicity did not influence the relationship between age and gender on personality assessment, further examination suggested that the relationship between gender and personality was impacted on by ethnicity. There were reassuring results found for New Zealand psychologists and HR specialists, as only two of the twelve traits analysed showed moderate differences on traits that were related to selection outcomes. However, for the NZ Army OSB selection process the findings in the present study indicate that the Lie scale on the EPQ-R and the Vigor trait on the GPP-I may need to be interpreted with caution for Asian and Pasifika groups. These results are discussed in terms of implications for personality theory, measurement, and the direction of future research.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personality assessment</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised</field><field name="subject">EPQ-R</field><field name="subject">Gordon Personal Profile - Inventory</field><field name="subject">GPP-I</field><field name="subject">ethnic status</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1188</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behaviour of milk protein-stabilized oil-in-water emulsions in simulated physiological fluids : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Sarkar, Anwesha</field><field name="description">Emulsions form a major part of processed food formulations, either being the end products in themselves or as parts of a more complex food system. For the past few decades, colloid scientists have focussed mainly on the effects of processing conditions (e.g. heat, high pressure, and shear) on the physicochemical properties of emulsions (e.g. viscosity, droplet size distribution and phase stability). However, the information about the behaviour of food structures post consumption is very limited. Fundamental knowledge of how the food structures behave in the mouth is critical, as these oral interactions of food components influence the common sensorial perceptions (e.g. creaminess, smoothness) and the release of fat-soluble flavours. Initial studies also suggest that the breakdown of emulsions in the gastrointestinal tract and the generated interfacial structures impact lipid digestion, which can consequently influence post-prandial metabolic responses. This area of research needs to be intensively investigated before the knowledge can be applied to rational design of healthier food structures that could modulate the rate of lipid metabolism, bioavailability of nutrients, and also help in providing targeted delivery of flavour molecules and/or bioactive components. Hence, the objective of this research was to gain understanding of how emulsions behave during their passage through the gastrointestinal tract. In vitro digestion models that mimic the physicochemical processes and biological conditions in the mouth and gastrointestinal tract were successfully employed. Behaviour of model protein-stabilized emulsions (both positively charged (lactoferrin) as well as negatively charged [&#946;-lactoglobulin (&#946;-lg)] oil-in-water emulsions) at each step of simulated physiological processing (using model oral, gastric and duodenal fluids individually) were investigated. In simulated mouth conditions, oil-in-water emulsions stabilized by lactoferrin or &#946;-lg at the interfacial layers were mixed with artificial saliva at neutral pH that contained a range of mucin concentrations and salts. The &#946;-lg emulsions did not interact with the artificial saliva due to the dominant repulsion between mutually opposite charges of anionic mucin and anionic &#946;-lg interfacial layer at neutral pH. However, &#946;-lg emulsions underwent some depletion flocculation on addition of higher concentrations of mucin due to the presence of unadsorbed mucin molecules in the continuous phase. In contrast, positively charged lactoferrin emulsions showed considerable salt-induced aggregation in the presence of salts (from the saliva) alone. Furthermore, lactoferrin emulsions underwent bridging flocculation because of electrostatic binding of anionic mucin to the positively charged lactoferrin-stabilized emulsion droplets. In acidic pH conditions (pH 1.2) of the simulated gastric fluid (SGF), both protein-stabilized emulsions were positively charged. Addition of pepsin resulted in extensive droplet flocculation in both emulsions with a greater extent of droplet instability in lactoferrin emulsions. Coalescence of the droplets was observed as a result of peptic hydrolysis of the interfacial protein layers. Conditions such as ionic strength, pH and exposure to mucin were shown to significantly influence the rate of hydrolysis of &#946;-lg-stabilized emulsion by pepsin. Addition of simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) containing physiological concentrations of bile salts to the emulsions showed competitive interfacial displacement of &#946;-lg by bile salts. In the case of lactoferrin-stabilized emulsion droplets, there was considerable aggregation in the presence of intestinal electrolytes alone (without added bile salts) at pH 7.5. Binding of anionic bile salts to cationic interfacial lactoferrin layer resulted in re-stabilization of salt-aggregated lactoferrin emulsions. On mixing with physiological concentrations of pancreatin (mixture of pancreatic lipase, amylase and protease), significant degree of coalescence and fatty acid release occurred for both the emulsions. This was attributed to the interfacial proteolysis by trypsin (proteolytic fractions of pancreatin) resulting in interfacial film rupturing. Exchange of initial interfacial materials by bile salts and trypsin-induced film breakage enhanced the potential for lipolytic fractions of pancreatin to act on the hydrophobic lipid core. The lipid digestion products (free fatty acids and mono and/or diglycerides) generated at the droplet surface further removed the residual intact protein layers from the interface by competitive displacement mechanisms. The sequential treatment of the cationic and anionic emulsions with artificial saliva, SGF and SIF, respectively, was determined to understand the impact of initial protein type during complete physiological processing from mouth to intestine. Broadly, both the protein-stabilized emulsions underwent charge reversals, extensive droplet flocculation, and significant coalescence as they passed through various stages of the in vitro digestion conditions. Except in the simulated mouth environment, the initial charge of the emulsifiers had relatively limited influence on droplet behaviour during the simulated digestion. The results contribute to the knowledge of how structure and charge of the emulsified lipid droplets impact digestion at various stages of physiology. This information might have important consequences for developing suitable microstructures that allow controlled breakdown of droplets in the mouth and predictable release of lipids in the gastrointestinal tract.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Milk protein</field><field name="subject">Emulsions</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290103 Food processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1409</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving effectiveness of dialogue in learning communities : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Ph.

The energy needed for lighting is also a significant impact on our natural resources. For these two broad reasons lighting systems that improve the human visual and perceptual experience and reduce energy use are of widespread value. This work covers research into the application of LED technology as the next generation of mainstream lighting. It looks at the reasons why this technology is set to become the dominant way in which we light our lives, and the technical hurdles that are slowing this shift in lighting. It also presents the development, testing and prototyping of such an LED lighting product for use in the architectural market. This niche application is where LED lighting is currently most suited, due to the compactness, colour adjustability and lower colour rendering required. Establishing the technology here will help to gain consumer appreciation and acceptance of this beneficial and useful new paradigm in lighting. The design incorporates a shape that is pleasing to the eye with a simple oval profile. It was designed to be subtle and compact, blending into the ceiling as cleanly as possible. Practical testing on the finished prototype showed it to produce a wide range of colours and colour temperatures, while maintaining a safe LED temperature. The simplicity also makes the unit competitive in terms of cost.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lighting design</field><field name="subject">LED</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering::290901 Electrical engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1411</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anaerobic co-digestion of municipal primary sludge and whey : a dissertation submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Masters degree in Environmental Engineering at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Xinyuan</field><field name="description">The aim of this research was to investigate the feasibility of co-digestion of municipal primary sludge and whey by anaerobic CSTR (Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor), as well as the factors that affect the performance of the co-digestion reactors. Before studying the co-digestion process, a semi-continuous whey digestion experiment was conducted to analyze the feasibility of anaerobic digestion of whey along with pH control. The results obtained from the study indicated that supplement of nutrients, trace elements as well as heavy metals was necessary to maintain the anaerobic whey digestion system. To investigate the co-digestion of primary sludge and whey process, the effects of pH, OLR (Organic Loading Rate), HRT (Hydraulic retention time) as well as the COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) loading ratio of primary sludge to whey on the performance of the reactors were studied. The results of the co-digestion experiments demonstrated that it was feasible to co-digest primary sludge and whey without nutrient, trace element and heavy metal supplement. The TCOD (Total Chemical Oxygen Demand) removal efficiency and the biogas production of the co-digestion system increased with the increase of OLR. At same OLR, digestion of the mixture of primary sludge and whey with higher whey content achieved higher biogas production and TCOD removal efficiency. The anaerobic co-digestion of primary sludge and whey process performed successfully at OLR of 5.8 &#177; 0.1g COD/l.d without pH control when the COD loading ratio of primary sludge to whey was approximately 70:30, due to the fact that the primary sludge may serve as buffering reagent. By adding sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) to maintain the pH at 6.9 &#177; 0.1, the OLR of the co-digestion reactor could reach 8.1 &#177; 0.1 g COD/l.d at HRT of 20 days. Moreover, by co-digestion of primary sludge and whey solution, the reactor could be operated successfully at HRT of 10 days and at OLR of 7.6 &#177; 0.1 g COD/l.d with COD loading ratio of primary sludge to whey of 53 : 47. The biogas production (3.2 &#177; 0.1 l/d) was 1.5 l/d higher than digestion of the same amount of primary sludge alone (1.7 &#177; 0.1 l/d).</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wastewater treatment</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering::291102 Bio-remediation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1412</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epigenetic characterisation of the 06 methyl-guanine DNA-methyltransferase promoter in New Zealand melanoma cell lines : a thesis presented to Massey University in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Biochemistry at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Rutherford, William Ernest</field><field name="description">New Zealand has the second highest incidence of melanoma skin cancer in the world. Chemotherapy is the standard treatment for melanoma derived tumours which have undergone metastasis and current therapies have limited benefit. There is a great need for new therapies and to increase the efficacy of current therapies. Temozolomide (TMZ) is a chemotherapy agent effective in the treatment of both metastatic melanoma and glioblastoma (brain cancer), although TMZ resistance has been observed in many tumours. The activity of the DNA repair enzyme O6 methyl-guanine methyltransferase (MGMT) is thought to be largely responsible for TMZ resistance. MGMT protects the cell from the effects of TMZ by removing cytotoxic lesions placed on the DNA. Mechanisms of regulation of MGMT expression remain unclear in melanoma. DNA methylation at the MGMT promoter has been linked to MGMT silencing in some cancers and has been associated with specific chromatin modifications. The present study was aimed at investigating the promoter methylation status of MGMT in primary melanoma cell lines using a new technique named methyl DNA immuno-precipitation (MeDIP). Next, the chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP) method was used to examine post translational modifications on the surrounding chromatin. The data obtained was correlated with both MGMT transcription levels and TMZ sensitivity. The promoter methylation status of MGMT has been used to predict the clinical responsiveness of glioblastoma patients to TMZ. Establishing the regulatory mechanisms of MGMT expression in melanoma patients would validate a means to predict clinical responsiveness to TMZ. Furthermore, establishing mechanisms of MGMT silencing may provide the basis for future clinical trials of novel therapies for melanoma and glioblastoma.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">06 methyl-guanine DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT)</field><field name="subject">Temozolomide (TMZ)</field><field name="subject">methyl DNA immuno-precipitation (MeDIP)</field><field name="subject">Chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP)</field><field name="subject">Melanoma chemotherapy</field><field name="subject">Glioblastoma chemotherapy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1414</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Package optimisation model : [a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Engineering in Engineering and Industrial Management at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand] EMBARGOED until 1 January 2013</field><field name="creator">Mueller, Bernd</field><field name="description">A bulk export orientated company has to optimise their packaging to be able to compete in a globalised world. Therefore it is important to maximise the container load to save shipping costs. This can be done in different ways, &#8226; by changing the product weight, &#8226; the packaging material or size, &#8226; the pallet/container size or, for some products, &#8226; the bulk density. With so many parameters affecting the container load finding the best packaging solution is difficult. To solve the problem an Add-on to for the existing packaging optimisation software Cape Pack called SADIE was developed. SADIE automates the process of data input into Cape Pack and allows browsing of different packaging combinations in a short time. Main feature of SADIE is that it allows testing complete weight and/or bulk density ranges in one Query. For that it takes the weight and the bulk density combination that is going to be tested and calculates the start dimension for a regular slotted case (RSC) with a 2:1:2 ratio, which, for a RSC, is the ratio that uses a minimum quantity of board. Those dimensions are then, with many other parameters, transferred into the Cape Pack Design mode where the new packaging solution is calculated and transferred back to SADIE. The data coming from SADIE was tested for consistency and was also used for physical pack size validations, both successfully. Packaging solutions for products with higher bulk densities could be optimised. A new packaging solution calculated for salted butter could save 231 container per annum. Depending on the destination of the butter cost savings from 184,000 US$ to 577,500 US$ would be possible. The results show that there are improvements in container load possible, especially for products in a higher bulk density range, like butter and cheese. An increase in container load for Whole milk powder (WMP) might be possible if another packaging system is used whereas for Skim milk powder (SMP), with its higher densities compared to WMP, the program can calculate improved container load without a change to the packaging system used.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Packaging system</field><field name="subject">Software development</field><field name="subject">Data processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation into the acidic protein fraction of bovine whey and its effect on bone cells : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Science in Chemistry at Massey University, New Zealand EMBARGOED till 1 December 2015</field><field name="creator">Mullan, Bernadette Jane</field><field name="description">Milk is provided to new borns as their first food source and it contains essential nutrients, vitamins and other beneficial components, such as enzymes and antibodies that are required for rapid growth and development of the new born and for sustained growth over time. Milk contains two main types of proteins; casein proteins and whey proteins. Although casein proteins account for up to 80% of the proteins found in bovine milk, it is the whey protein that has become of high interest because of its bioactive content. Whey, a very watery mixture of lactose, proteins, minerals and trace amounts of fat, is formed from milk when the milk is coagulated and/or the casein proteins are removed from the milk. Bovine whey protein, including both the acidic and basic fractions (low and high isoelectric point, respectively), has previously been studied in vitro (cell based) and in vivo (using rats) for its impact on bone to determine if it can help improve bone mineral density and help reduce the risk of developing bone diseases, such as osteoporosis. Bone is constantly undergoing a remodelling process of being dissolved and reformed and the two main cell types responsible for this bone remodelling process are mature osteoclasts, which dissolve (resorb) bone, and osteoblasts, which reform the bone. Prior work has shown that acidic protein fractions derived from different sources of whey protein concentrate (WPC) have both in vivo and in vitro activity on bone, particularly anti-resorptive properties. However, the component(s) which confer activity have not yet been identified. In this thesis, work was undertaken to better understand the analytical composition of three types of WPC (cheese, mineral acid and lactic acid) and their associated acidic protein fractions and relate this to bone activity in the hope of identifying where the activity lies. Bone activity was assessed using in vitro screening with osteoblast cells (MC3T3-E1) and osteoclast cells (RAW 264.7). Comparison of the cell-based bone activity of the parent WPCs and corresponding acidic fractions indicated that the acidic fractions derived from both mineral acid and lactic WPC were superior in their ability to inhibit osteoclast development. Although compositional data was complex and definitive correlations with both bone bioactivities could not be made, it appeared that elements common to both the acidic fractions were a higher proportion of GLYCAM-1 and bone sialoprotein-1 (osteopontin). Further studies to more closely investigate the bone bioactivity of the acidic fractions are warranted.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bovine whey protein concentrate</field><field name="subject">Acidic protein fractions</field><field name="subject">Bone bioactivity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250300 Organic Chemistry::250302 Biological and medical chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1415</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Irish music in Wellington : a study of a local music community : a thesis submitted for the Victoria University of Wellington in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Musicology, New Zealand School of Music, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Thurston, Donna</field><field name="description">The Irish session is a musical, social and cultural experience that has emerged from international popularisation and globalisation. In New Zealand today, communities of Irish music enthusiasts maintain links to an international arena, and the session is valued as a context for musical enjoyment and the affirmation of Irish identity. Throughout my research I immersed myself in Wellington&#8217;s vibrant Irish music scene with fieldwork techniques that included participant observation, sound recordings, and performance. The major part of this study took place in two local Wellington pubs - Molly Malone&#8217;s and Kitty O&#8217;Shea&#8217;s &#8211; but I also observed sessions in other New Zealand cities and in Ireland. The similarities and differences between the two Wellington sessions were examined in detail and my research included extensive interviews with the participants. In addition to exploring Irish sessions in the context of two Wellington pubs, this thesis explores session instrumentation and repertoire, and aspects of cultural identity that include the participant&#8217;s experiences with Irish music. This thesis also examines how individual session members actively contribute and link their musical training and background to a transnational Irish music community. By studying the individual and musical identities of those actively involved in the community, this thesis reveals that Irish music in Wellington is an active and dynamic scene made up of enthusiasts with a variety of musical and cultural backgrounds. With music as its heart, the Wellington session community, is simultaneously localised in New Zealand but extends outward and connects with Irish communities globally.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Irish music</field><field name="subject">Wellington New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410100 Performing Arts Studies::410101 Music studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1416</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Christian Gotthilf Tag four sonatas transcribed for guitar duo : a thesis submitted to the New Zealand School of Music in partial fulfllment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Music in Performance</field><field name="creator">Ro&#380;nawski, Jakub Pawel</field><field name="description">This study focuses on a guitar duo transcription of four keyboard sonatas composed by the north German Cantor, Christian Gotthilf Tag (1735-1811).

Its primary motivation was to explore a possible interaction by uniquely combining three independent saccade factors: the gap effect, target-feature-discrimination, and saccadic inhibition of return (IOR). Its secondary motivation was to replicate (in a more conservative and tightly controlled design) the surprising findings of Trottier and Pratt (2005), who found that requiring a high resolution task at the saccade target location speeded saccades, apparently by disinhibition. Trottier and Pratt&#146;s finding was so surprising it raised the question: Could the oculomotor braking effect of saccadic IOR to previously viewed locations be reduced or removed by requiring a high resolution task at the target location? Twenty na&#239;ve untrained undergraduate students participated in exchange for course credit. Multiple randomised temporal and spatial target parameters were introduced in order to increase probability of exogenous responses. The primary measured variable was saccade latency in milliseconds, with the expectation of higher probability of very fast saccades (i.e. 80-120ms). Previous research suggested that these very fast saccades could be elicited in special testing circumstances with na&#239;ve participants, such as during the gap task, or in highly trained observers in non-gap tasks (Fischer &amp; Weber, 1993). Trottier and Pratt (2005) found that adding a task demand that required na&#239;ve untrained participants to obtain a feature of the target stimulus (and to then make a discriminatory decision) also produced a higher probability of very fast saccade latencies. They stated that these saccades were not the same as saccade latencies previously referred to as express saccades produced in the gap paradigm, and proposed that such very fast saccades were normal. Carpenter (2001) found that in trained participants the probability of finding very fast saccades during the gap task increased when the horizontal direction of the current saccade continued in the same direction as the previous saccade (as opposed to reversing direction) &#150; giving a distinct bimodality in the distribution of latencies in five out of seven participants, and likened his findings to the well known IOR effect. The IOR effect has previously been found in both manual key-press RT and saccadic latency paradigms. Hunt and Kingstone (2003) stated that there were both cortical top-down and oculomotor hard-wired aspects to IOR. An experiment was designed that included obtain-target-feature and oculomotor-prior-direction, crossed with two gap level offsets (0ms &amp; 200ms-gap). Target-feature discrimination accuracy was high (97%). Under-additive main effects were found for each factor, with a three-way interaction effect for gap by obtain-feature by oculomotor-prior-direction. Another new three-way interaction was also found for anticipatory saccade type. Anticipatory saccades became significantly more likely under obtain-target-feature for the continuing oculomotor direction. This appears to be a similar effect to the increased anticipatory direction-error rate in the antisaccade task. These findings add to the saccadic latency knowledge base and in agreement with both Carpenter and Trottier and Pratt, laboratory testing paradigms can affect saccadic latency distributions. That is, salient (meaningful) targets that follow more natural oculomotor trajectories produce higher probability of very fast latencies in the 80-120ms range. In agreement with Hunt and Kingstone, there appears to be an oculomotor component to IOR. Specifically, saccadic target-prior-location interacts differently for obtain-target-feature under 200-ms gap than under 0ms-gap, and is most likely due predominantly to a predictive disinhibitory oculomotor momentum effect, rather than being due to the attentional inhibitory effect proposed for key-press IOR. A new interpretation for the paradigm previously referred to as IOR is offered that includes a link to the smooth pursuit system. Additional studies are planned to explore saccadic interactions in more detail.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">saccade latency</field><field name="subject">abrupt eye movements</field><field name="subject">rapid eye movements</field><field name="subject">rapid intermittent eye movement</field><field name="subject">intermittent eye movement</field><field name="subject">oculomotor</field><field name="subject">oculomotor direction</field><field name="subject">saccade</field><field name="subject">saccadic</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20100705.111516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular Analysis of Fungal Pathogenicity in Crown Rot Disease of Wheat Caused by Fusarium graminearum</field><field name="creator">Amber Stephens</field><field name="description">Several Fusarium species can cause Fusarium head blight (FHB) and Fusarium crown rot (FCR) diseases in wheat and these are of economic importance in wheat production systems globally. Fusarium graminearum represents a model pathogen species to study these diseases because it has a sequenced genome, commercially available gene expression arrays and an growing collection of mutants impaired in pathogenicity and virulence, at least for FHB. FCR occurs at the stem base of the wheat plant, causing major reductions in grain yield. FCR has been much less intensively researched than FHB and the infection process of F. graminearum during crown rot disease in wheat has not been studied previously at the molecular level. Fungal biomass estimations by real-time quantitative PCR analysis of DNA from inoculated plants identified three distinct phases of infection during FCR, an initial increase in fungal mass in phase 1 up to 2 days post inoculation (dpi), then a reduction during phase 2 until 14 dpi followed by a large increase thereon in phase 3 that corresponded to symptom development. Histological characterisation of F. graminearum colonisation during these three phases of infection showed that initially the spores germinated on the stem surface at the point of inoculation forming a superficial hyphal mat. This occurred within the first two days of infection. The second phase was characterised by a period of low amounts of fungal tissue present in the infected plants and 14 days following infection hyphae were only observed below the point of inoculation at the stem base of the wheat seedling and had penetrated and colonised the adaxial epidermis of the outer leaf sheath. Following this, the third phase was characterised by a major colonisation of the internal tissues of the crown which corresponded to visible symptom development around 35 days after inoculation. Fungal gene expression during all three phases of infection were examined using the Affymetrix GeneChip system comprised of 22,000 F. graminearum gene probe sets. This analysis showed 1,839 genes were significantly up regulated in planta compared to axenic vegetative mycelia, including some known FHB virulence genes (e.g. those involved in the biosynthesis of trichothecene toxins). Fungal genes differentially regulated between the phases were identified indicating that FCR disease development requires a coordinated process involving distinct fungal gene expression programs. A bioinformatic comparison of global F. graminearum gene expression during FCR of wheat with published data for FHB of barley indicated similarities at very early stages of infection but divergence thereafter. It was decided to functionally test whether F. graminearum utilises the same virulence genes in FCR and FHB diseases. Because no virulence genes have been previously identified from FCR studies a small group of genes were initially selected from the FCR gene expression studies for further functional analysis using gene knock-out technology. Only two of these genes showed a changed phenotype during Fusarium infection of wheat plants and they encoded a probable ABC transporter (FgABC1) and a probable superoxide dismutase (FgSOD1). It was interesting to note that even though both FgABC1 and FgSOD1 exhibited similar transcription profiles during both FCR of wheat and FHB of barley it was found that FgABC1 was specifically required for full FCR disease development on the wheat cultivar Kennedy whereas FgSOD1 was specifically required for FHB disease on the same cultivar. This indicated that F. graminearum virulence genes can show specificity to the infection of different plant tissues and that these types of genes cannot be predicted based only on their transcription profiles. It is suggested that F. graminearum induces a global set of virulence factors but only some of these may be effective in particular tissues. To test further whether there was tissue specialisation for specific tissues and FCR &amp; FHB diseases, a group of F. graminearum genes that were known virulence factors during FHB were tested to see if they were also virulence factors for FCR. This analysis showed that two genes displayed specificity only for FHB and five were virulence factors for both FHB and FCR. One of the genes that was a virulence factor for both diseases was the Tri5 gene that is necessary for the biosynthesis of trichothecene mycotoxins. This gene and these toxins did not appear to be necessary for symptom development and the induction of host defence responses but were necessary for fungal colonisation of the crown and stem in later stages of infection. Interestingly there were parallels in the role played by the Tri5 gene in FCR and that reported for FHB where it is necessary for colonisation for the spike. This study is the first molecular analysis of any Fusarium species during crown rot of wheat. Importantly, it shows that there may be specialisation towards host tissues for some virulence genes but also suggests that some factors may be non-specifically required for infection and it is these factors that will represent attractive targets for future control measures of both diseases.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fusarium graminearum, head blight, crown rot, Deoxynivalenol, pathogen, Superoxide, ABC transporter, mycotoxin</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205309</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contributions to the Theory and Practice of Inequality Measurement</field><field name="creator">Nicholas Rohde</field><field name="description">The thesis presents results from five related studies concerned with the development and application of analytical techniques for the measurement of inequality. Four of the research pieces are analytical works focusing on the methodology of inequality measurement, while the fifth is an empirical study of income mobility and inequality in Australia. The most significant work of the dissertation is concerned with the derivation of a new information-theoretic index for the measurement of inequality. The proposed index is based upon the same relationship between information theory and inequality measurement used for the construction of Generalized Entropy (GE) inequality measures and is equivalent to a technique established in the field of signal processing. The measure shares the axiomatic superiority of GE measures over other measurement techniques and exhibits an additional attractive decomposition property such that the contribution of any set of individuals towards inequality is directly observable. No existing axiomatically complete measure possesses this property and thus the new measure has a degree of dominance over other techniques such as the Gini coefficient and Theil&#8217;s entropy measures. An empirical illustration of the new index using U.S. unit record income data is provided to demonstrate the alternative decomposition technique. It is shown that persons self-described as &#8216;White&#8217; or &#8216;Japanese&#8217; in the U.S. census drive a greater proportion of total inequality than persons from other racial groups relative to their respective population sizes. Other theoretical work in the thesis focuses on the construction and interpretation of Lorenz curves. A new parametric functional form for estimating the Lorenz curve is presented and closed form expressions for the implicit probability density function, cumulative distribution function and Gini coefficient are derived. Furthermore the proposed Lorenz curve is shown to provide a better fit to a range of real world data than other single parameter specifications such as the Pareto formulation. In a separate chapter the issue of Lorenz curve determination is addressed by determining a convex spline to interpolate Lorenz curves from grouped data. The spline is shown to provide better estimates of the Gini coefficient than other interpolation techniques and always satisfies the regularity conditions required for a Lorenz curve. Additional work on Lorenz curves examines the link between these functions and GE inequality metrics. In the thesis it is shown that these indices may be derived as direct functions of the Lorenz curve and analytical expressions for various GE measures are given in terms of Lorenz curve parameters. These results provide a basis for studying the effect of Lorenz curve construction upon the calculation of entropy based inequality measurements. The thesis concludes with an empirical study into income inequality and mobility in Australia using the HILDA unit record and household data panel. The research shows that Australian income mobility is slightly lower than in other developed countries and that much of the observed mobility occurs at the lower end of the income distribution.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">14 Economics</field><field name="subject">Generalized Entropy, Income mobility, Inequality, Lorenz curve</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205529</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Testing general rules in landscape ecology: Understanding the effects of landscape pattern on the avifauna of South East Queensland</field><field name="creator">Danielle Shanahan</field><field name="description">Human land-use has a profound influence on wildlife populations; habitat loss can directly decrease population size and carrying capacity, and isolation of the remaining populations can increase their extinction probability. Landscape ecology as a discipline has worked towards creating general rules for the way species respond to landscape change. These rules include, for example, estimates of thresholds at which populations respond more severely to landscape level variables, or general theories as to which species will be more susceptible to landscape change. The demand for these generalisations is driven by the need for inexpensive, rapid and effective methods to manage problems caused by landscape change. The question as to whether general rules are accurate or useful solicits mixed responses from scientists and conservation managers. The most cited reason for this mixed response is the empirical inconsistencies in the way species respond to landscape change. In this thesis I suggest that general rules must be tested in an a priori fashion to directly assess their utility and assist in their translation from theory to practical tool. My primary aim is to test general rules in landscape ecology through creating a priori models; these models are based on ecological theories and existing species and landscape information. My secondary aim is to enhance the understanding of landscape level habitat fragmentation problems for birds in South East Queensland, Australia. I address these aims within four main data chapters as summarised below, where Chapter 1 is a broad introduction to the topic. Chapter 2 asks the question: can general rules and threshold theory be used to predict bird species patch occupancy in a fragmented landscape? I create a simple decision tree model based on threshold theories in landscape ecology, and use this to predict presence or absence of 17 forest bird species in a largely agricultural landscape. This decision tree is broadly based on theoretical patch area and connectivity threshold estimates, and incorporates basic species specific information (such as habitat suitability and mobility). I test this model using a presence/absence survey data set. The process of assessing for which species the model did not work is revealing: I show that the accuracy of &#8216;present&#8217; predictions is somewhat compromised for habitat specialist species and &#8216;absent&#8217; predictions are compromised for generalist species. Through creating the &#8216;optimal&#8217; decision tree models for these species I show that these inaccuracies are likely to arise from vegetation mapping problems, including the lack of a &#8216;habitat quality&#8217; measure. The study therefore highlights the need for high quality vegetation maps to carry out effective planning. For the majority of species I achieve reasonable predictive success. This study provides hope that general rules have some predictive ability in landscape ecology, and highlights the value of testing models to assess why, and for which species general rules may or may not work. In Chapter 3, I assess the utility of basic ecological principles for predicting the relative value of vegetation patches for specific bird species, focusing on a highly altered urban landscape. I create a model based on the mechanisms expected to be driving species abundance within urban landscapes where most sensitive bird species are likely to be already lost. The model states that a bird species will be more abundance in areas where the vegetation structure matches a species foraging height requirements; however, this effect will be moderated by the landscape context of the patch. From this model I create an index to quantify and rank the predicted value of patches for 30 species of interest in unmanaged and revegetated urban sites, in Brisbane city, Australia. I test the model using bird abundance data, and show that it achieved a reasonable level of predictive accuracy. The model presented within this study is significant as it has relatively low complexity and limited data requirements, yet provides a means to assess how altering the landscape context and vegetation structure within a patch may enhance the abundance of bird species of interest. With further development, the relative simplicity of the model should make it easy to use for land managers. In Chapter 4 I aim to examine how landscape features influence spatial genetic relatedness patterns at a fine, within-population scale on bird species with different life-history traits. I argue that individual level movement characteristics (particularly dispersal routes) in a variable landscape will drive these spatial genetic patterns; thus I create an a priori model based on this theory to make more specific quantifiable predictions of relatedness patterns. I use animal movement theory to deduce these movement characteristics (particularly the strength of avoidance of habitat boundaries) for species with different life-history traits, and apply the model for two closely related passerine bird species which co-occur within South East Queensland (the yellow-throated scrubwren, Sericornis citreogularis, a habitat specialist; and the white-browed scrubwren, Sericornis frontalis, a habitat generalist). I test these models using data on pairwise genetic distances between individuals of each species. The key outcome of this study is that the genetic data supports my predictions that individual level movement characteristics are a mechanistic driver of within-population spatial genetic patterns. For the habitat specialist bird species, the genetic data supported a model which incorporated a strong avoidance response to habitat boundaries and for the generalist species no response to habitat boundaries. This study takes a novel approach to an individual-based genetics study, making specific quantifiable predictions of how a species may be impacted by different landscape features. This research could have significant implications for conservation management, particularly for understanding and managing population responses to a changing landscape, and the early stages of fragmentation. In Chapter 5 I address the question of whether urban revegetation is more successful if it is used to extend the area of existing vegetation, or enhance connectivity in the landscape. This study is novel; for instead of assessing the factors influencing the extinction of a species in a patch, I assess the factors influencing colonisation. Using bird survey data, I use hierarchical partitioning and model selection approaches to determine the relative effect of connectivity and patch area on bird species richness and abundance in revegetated patches. The key finding was that connectivity provided better model fit for bird species richness, and total patch area and connectivity was better for mean bird abundance. My results suggest that the conservation goals of revegetation efforts, particularly in an urban landscape, must be considered when planning a revegetation program. Using revegetation to increase patch area may be the most effective approach for ensuring species persistence over time (i.e. abundance). However, to attract more species into an area enhancing the total area connected in the landscape may be a better approach. In this thesis I explicitly test general rules and theories in landscape ecology within a priori predictive models. Through their generality, the models I develop are potentially suitable for application in other ecosystems. The process of synthesising these models in a simple form, and testing them in a real landscape was revealing. I was able to examine where some general rules do not work, and also where they may not apply or need adjusting. I strived to create models that are easy to use and understand, particularly within Chapters 2 and 4, by trading off simplicity and accuracy. The models produce accurate results to the point that they are arguably valuable tools for landscape managers. This is achieved without compromising their accessibility, and so the research has the potential to transcend the gap between science and real world utility.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biological conservation</field><field name="subject">landscape genetics</field><field name="subject">landscape ecology</field><field name="subject">urban ecology</field><field name="subject">predictive models</field><field name="subject">habitat fragmentation</field><field name="subject">revegetation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205688</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multi-Scale, Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Mammalian Cell Tomograms</field><field name="creator">Andrew Noske</field><field name="description">The biological, technical and computational aspects of this project collectively focused on using electron tomography (ET) for the high-resolution (10-20 nm) 3D reconstruction of entire insulin-secreting beta cells within islets of Langerhans isolated from mouse pancreata. Islets were cultured overnight to represent either steady-state (non-stimulated) or elevated glucose (stimulated) conditions, prior to fast-freezing, freeze-substitution, plastic embedment and cutting into 250-400 nm thick sections for tomographic imaging using intermediate voltage electron microscopy (EM). 3D images (tomograms) of each section were used to evaluate the performance of the new technical and computational approaches developed, and make biological comparisons of intercellular structure-function. Analysis focused on key compartments/organelles of the insulin-secretory pathway - Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, insulin secretory granules and multi-granular bodies. To allow the application of ET to entire mammalian cells, several technical limitations were addressed. Since segmenting (delimiting compartments of interest) tomograms manually, represented the major &#235;rate-limiting step&#237; of ET, an interactive approach for 3D segmentation using novel interpolation algorithms (crude smooth, pointwise smooth and spherical interpolation) to iteratively predict the shape of 3D surfaces between user-drawn contours was developed. The performance of these tools in segmenting a range of compartment types was examined, and found to significantly enhance the speed and accuracy of manual segmentation. To better compensate for the physical collapse of plastic sections in the EM, a novel method was developed for estimating section collapse by analyzing approximately spherical organelles. Using this method on mature insulin granules in high-resolution datasets, coupled with measurements from the whole cell reconstructions, section collapse was found to be substantially less (~25%) than the value (40%) previously used to re-scale 3D models. Other new approaches developed to further improve the accuracy and quality of tomograms, included interactive tools for fiducial tracking, and the use of larger gold particles, a &#235;reduced second axis&#237; to account for the missing wedge problem, and deformation grids to account for anisotropic deformation. As well as affording more efficient and precise mapping of cell ultrastructure in 3D for subsequent quantitative analysis, these developments provided new insights for future automated (hybrid) segmentation pipelines and new computational approaches for improving quality and isotropic accuracy of volumetric image data. The Interpolator and DrawingTools for segmentation, AnalysisTools for estimating section collapse and BeadHelper for tracking fiducial particles, written as plug-ins for the IMOD software package distributed by the University of Colorado, are now being used by the wider ET community with significant positive feedback. Using the novel approaches developed, four insulin-secreting beta cells - two from the periphery of an islet frozen 1 hr after stimulation with 11 mM glucose, and two from the periphery of another islet under steady-state 5.6 mM glucose conditions - were reconstructed in their entirety in 3D. Quantitative data on the key compartments/organelles provided new information regarding global changes in cellular organization, and enabled robust comparisons of each pair of functionally equivalent cells at unprecedented spatial resolution. Relative differences in the number, dimensions, architecture and distribution of organelles per cubic micron of cellular volume (including mitochondrial branching) reflected differences in the cells&#237; individual capacity/readiness to respond to secretagogue stimulation. In the two stimulated cells this was reflected by inverse relationships between the number/size of mature granules versus immature granules, the number/size of mitochondria, and the volume of the trans-Golgi network relative to the entire Golgi ribbon. Complementary stereological analysis of whole islets indicated which cells were the most representative under stimulated versus non-stimulated conditions, and revealed a marked natural heterogeneity between cells both within and between individual islets. Overall, this project led to significant improvements in efficiency and accuracy for segmenting cellular compartments/organelles, and in image quality and accuracy for tomogram computation and reconstruction through use of the newly developed techniques. The improved 3D reconstruction and analysis of pancreatic beta cells in toto in native tissue provided a powerful approach for quantitatively mapping the organelles involved in insulin synthesis/secretion at unprecedented detail, and afforded a level of insight into the complex 3D organization of mammalian cells not previously achieved by any other analytical technique or imaging method.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">electron microscope tomography</field><field name="subject">three-dimensional spatial analysis</field><field name="subject">interpolation</field><field name="subject">automatic segmentation</field><field name="subject">beta cell</field><field name="subject">mouse pancreas</field><field name="subject">insulin secretory pathway</field><field name="subject">image processing</field><field name="subject">whole cell tomography</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205852</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PREDICTING UNSCHEDULED DENTAL VISITS BY MEMBERS OF THE AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE FORCE</field><field name="creator">Gregory Mahoney</field><field name="description">Background. Whether or not the Australian serviceman is dentally fit for deployment is determined by the dental fitness standard based on NATO&#8217;s dental fitness standard for military personnel. Recent operations by Australian, European, and USA defence forces has found that being dentally fit to deployment is not predictive of whether or not a member is likely to have a dental problem in the twelve months between their dental assessments. In order to maintain an effective member in the field, a suitable risk management assessment pre-deployment is essential so that dental casualties are better managed either through having fewer casualties and/or having those casualties better managed in the field. Aim. The aim of this thesis is to establish a Dental Fitness Classification which more accurately predicts a member&#8217;s risk of an Unscheduled Dental Visit (UDV) than the existing Denclas system of classification. Methodology. A prospective cohort study was conducted on 875 Australian service men and women in all 3 services in 7 operational bases across Australia with ages ranging from 17-56. Participants were enrolled during their annual dental examination where clinical details were recorded and a questionnaire completed on demographics and lifestyles of participants. UDVs over the next twelve months were enumerated as any visit to the dental centre which did not form part of their planned treatment following an annual dental examination. The data were first analyzed for associations between each putative risk factor and a binary variable indicating whether or not participants had a UDV in the 12 months since enrolment into the study. Variables for the modeling were then selected that yielded moderately significant associations with the odds of a UDV. From the prospective modeling, the parameter estimates from the logistic regression model (including the intercept) were then used to create an Excel spreadsheet for use in dental clinics. The spreadsheet contained the algorithm that calculated a patient&#8217;s probability of having a UDV, based on the reduced set of clinical findings and questionnaire responses found to optimize sensitivity and specificity. Results. Prediction models were most accurate when created for the two cohorts; the dentally fit and dentally unfit. The dentally fit model has 8 variables; Denclas 2 (OR=1.50); Unsupported enamel on a an endodontically treated tooth (OR=22.87); Deep periodontal pocketing (OR=13.97); Healthy Diet (OR= 0.07); Oral Hygiene Score (OR=0.27); Years of Service (OR= 3.96 &amp; 3.49); Prior Visits to the Dentist only for the Relief of Pain (OR=0.35) and the interaction term of Denclas and Unsupported enamel on an endodontically treated tooth (OR= 0.09). The model has a sensitivity =82.61% and a specificity =70.23%. The dentally unfit model has 3 variables; Denclas 4(OR=7.08); Large Fillings (OR=7.06) and Toothbrushing times per week (OR=1.95) with a sensitivity =62.86% and specificity = 77.71%. The dentally fit model has excellent discrimination (Area Under the Receiver Operator Characteristic (AUROC) =0.83) and the dentally unfit has a reasonable discrimination (AUROC=0.74) and both are better than the Denclas system in practice in Defence Force Dental Services around the world (OR=1.80, sensitivity= 41.67% and specificity =72.22%). These models can be used to determine a member&#8217;s risk of becoming a UDV from a simple chairside tool embedded in a Microsoft Excel&#174; file. Conclusion. There is a set of easily obtainable variables that can more accurately predict an ADF member&#8217;s likelihood of becoming a UDV than the present Denclas system which can be adapted to determine a member&#8217;s risk at the chairside.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Military Dentistry</field><field name="subject">Risk Prediction</field><field name="subject">Oral Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Dental Fitness</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Making sense of no body</field><field name="creator">Wood, Becca</field><field name="description">This Masters in Art and Design investigates a performance strategy for the deterritorialization of the body, mind and space as they intersect the digital screen image. The reconfiguration of the sensing system as the body encounters the digital image deterritorializes the body&#8217;s everyday modes of proprioception and spatial orientation. The assumption here is the increasing 'instability' of the body in a contemporary world where the digital screen image mediates and renegotiates our physical encounters. In prioritizing the body in these screen environments, there is potential for rethinking a body politic for performance and somatic practice. My strategy is to reconfigure the multi-modal processing where the screen dominates the visual faculties in the mind/body/screen relationship. Using wireless cameras attached to the body and improvisational structures for performance, divergent spaces are connected and collected through the body, screen and the camera. As the body and screen intersect, the corporeal and the image converge and manifest through the imagination and screen.

These factors are a function of hinterland processes: tectonic setting, provenance, climate and depositional environment, and sediment transportation processes. This study focuses on a modern, dryland, fluvial deposition system from source-to-sink that aims to provide a quantitative dataset analogue to facilitate forward modelling for prediction of subsurface compositions, grain size and textures of reservoir sandstones. Umbum Creek, in the western Lake Eyre Basin of Central Australia, was selected as a small river network (~ 100km&#178;) in order to study source-to-sink sedimentation. The provenance area was analysed using isopach maps derived from a 783 drill-hole dataset, which included stratigraphy and lithology information. Subsequently forty-three samples of different provenance lithotypes from the Umbum Creek catchment were collected for petrographic thin-section analysis. Recent sediments were then sampled from 90 strategically located stream confluences along Umbum Creek and tributaries (proximal, medial and distal subsets). A quantitative textural and compositional dataset was subsequently generated from 34 selected samples. With half-phi sieve analysis (4mm to 32 microns), and an associated petrographic description recognising 72 categories of grain composition was undertaken for each sample. The provenance analysis using isopach maps demonstrated that Palaeozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary basin evolution in the study area was controlled by northeast and northwest-trending structural elements. The regional uplift of the Peake and Denison Inliers that occurred during the Cenozoic had a significant impact on the evolution of the Lake Eyre Basin, causing changes in the provenance of Late Neogene sedimentation and on through to the present. The sink area represents a shallow intracratonic basin whereby a thin veneer of fluvial/lacustrine sediments is accumulating adjacent to a basement uplift. This study has highlighted the importance of multiple sediment provenances. Five different provenance lithotype grains were identified in the Umbum Creek modern sediments: the Gawler Craton plutonic / basement provenance (recycled) the Peake and Denison Inliers Proterozoic volcanic provenance (recycled), the Davenport Ranges metamorphic provenance, the Mesozoic sedimentary provenance and the Cenozoic sedimentary provenance. Whereas a downstream fining of grain size was expected, a general trend of downstream coarsening of grain size was noted being the result of aeolian deflation of fines and intra-basinal coarse-grained sediment contributions. In the sink area, modern sediments from the terminal splay complex comprise 70-80% quartz, 10-20% lithic fragments (of which ~ 7% are ductile lithic grains), &lt; 3% feldspar, and clay (&lt;2%). Grains are sub-angular to well-rounded and moderately well sorted. The compositional and textural maturity of the terminal splay sediments is attributed to reworked plutonic quartz grains, the dissolution and disintegration of feldspar and carbonate grains during transportation, along with the breakdown of lithic fragments due to fluvio-aeolian interactions and subsequent mechanical/ chemical weathering processes. These data were used to build a predictive forward model for modal sandstone analysis that achieved a fair to good correlation between predicted and observed grain lithotypes and provenance categories. These results illustrate that the character of sands in the Umbum Creek catchment are governed by a multiplicity of controls such as tectonic setting, provenance lithotype analysis, climate, regional topographic gradient, hinterland transport distance, basin subsidence rate and depositional environment. The fluvio-aeolian depositional environment along with the current arid to semi-arid playa climatic conditions of Umbum Creek catchment facilitate the growth of clay coatings, however accounts for a low clay matrix within the deposits. In addition, the playa environment also facilitates the alteration of infiltrated detrital clay to kaolinite, the formation of evaporites (gypsum, halite and anhydrite) and the formation of authigenic clays. These factors are all significant in determining the ultimate reservoir quality of reservoir sandstones, emphasising the importance of this study as an analogue for modelling &#8216;buried&#8217; dryland depositional systems.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">provenance; lithotype; modelling; lithology; source to sink; mixing effect; meta-sedimentary; diagenesis</field><field name="subject">Sedimentation and deposition South Australia Lake Eyre Basin</field><field name="subject">Water quality South Australia Lake Eyre Basin</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/56268</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polymorphism of cranial suture obliteration in adult crania.</field><field name="creator">Dayal, Manisha Ramanlal</field><field name="description">Cranial sutures are fibrous joints of the skull which allow for growth in young individuals. The sutural ligament is the fibrous connective material found between the two joint surfaces which can be divided into a number of different layers. During embryonic development and growth, ossification centres in the skull allow for the growth and development of the flat bones in the skull. Sutures are the areas where these ossification centres eventually meet. Some sutures like the frontal suture normally disappear at the age of two years, but it has been shown that this suture can persist in adulthood and is then called the metopic suture. Torgersen (1950) has shown that the obliteration pattern of the metopic suture is the same for skulls belonging to common inheritance trajectories. Cranial suture closure has thus been shown to be controlled by genes. In physical anthropology, obliteration of cranial sutures has been used as an age-at-death indicator since 1542. However, in 1890, Dwight rejected the notion that there was any relationship between age and obliteration patterns. Despite this, there have been a number of studies that have continued to use this method to estimate age-at-death from skeletal remains. These methods are currently still being used. The aim of this study was to investigate cranial suture obliteration patterns in adult crania. A total of 490 randomly selected modern black and white South African skulls from the Dart Collection were used to collect data. The ages of the individuals ranged from 19 to 98 years. Two methods previously used to estimate age from skeletal remains were used to assess the final obliteration status of the sutures. The scores assigned to these sutures were then subjected to statistical analyses to explore any relationship between age, sex and population affinity. The results show that considerable polymorphism in the obliteration pattern of the cranial vault sutures exist. The endocranial scores are bimodal while the ectocranial aspects using both the Acs&#225;di &amp; Nemesk&#233;ri (1970) and Meindl &amp; Lovejoy (1985) method are multimodal. Bimodality and multimodality are direct indications of polymorphism. No significant relationship was found between obliteration and age. Thereafter the two methods initially used to assess the sutures were used to estimate the age of the skulls to test these methods. The results show that both these methods are not useful as age estimators when used on individuals drawn from the South African black and white populations. Since the large majority of variation in cranial suture obliteration is not explainable by age, it is hypothesized that patterns of the cranial vault suture obliteration are the result of epigenetic variation similar to that occurring elsewhere on the skeleton, and not a regular result of aging.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cranial sutures; physical anthropology</field><field name="subject">Cranial sutures</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/56272</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of zinc in preventing fetal dysmorphology and brain injury mediated by maternal exposure to infection in pregnancy.</field><field name="creator">Chua, Joanne Sing Cheng</field><field name="description">Maternal exposure to viral and bacterial infection during pregnancy is associated with fetal dysmorphology and neurodevelopmental disorders including schizophrenia, cerebral palsy, autism and mental retardation. Previous studies in our laboratory using an established mouse model of endotoxin-induced fetal dysmorphology have led to the hypothesis that birth defects caused by infections during pregnancy are the result of fetal zinc deficiency resulting from the induction of a zinc-binding protein, metallothionein (MT) in the maternal liver as part of the maternal inflammatory response. Thus, we predicted that zinc deficiency would exacerbate the negative fetal outcomes caused by bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and that zinc supplementation would protect against LPS-mediated teratogenicity. This premise was investigated herein and was extended to investigate underlying molecular mechanism, including the identification of markers of neurodevelopmental damage following LPS administration in early and late pregnancy, and to determine the influence of zinc treatment on any changes in expression of these markers. In Chapter 2 it was demonstrated that prenatal exposure to LPS on gestational day (GD) 8 resulted in the development of physical birth defects including exencephaly, microcephaly, cleft lip and or palate, and micrognathia in GD 18 fetuses. Dietary zinc supplementation throughout pregnancy was found to prevent the LPS-related abnormalities. Furthermore, low dietary zinc and LPS exposure were found to be synergistic on teratogenicity. In addition, an inverse linear relationship was observed between the concentration of zinc in the diet and teratogenicity with a reduction in the incidence of birth defects observed with increasing concentration of dietary zinc, a finding suggesting that even small increments of zinc above normal dietary intake are likely to have a beneficial impact on teratogenicity. Maternal infection during late pregnancy has also been linked with prenatal brain damage. A major causal link underpinning this relationship is thought to be the cytokines released following a maternal inflammatory response to infection. In Chapter 3, the presence of cytokines released in response to LPS given on GD 16 was demonstrated by an increased number of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-!)-reactive cells and astrogliosis accompanied by extensive apoptotic cell death in GD 18 fetal brain. Recently our laboratory has reported that dietary zinc supplementation throughout pregnancy, prevented impairments in object recognition memory in offspring from dams exposed to prenatal LPS on GD 8. The question arises as to whether zinc is protective against LPS-exposure in late pregnancy. In Chapter 3, it is further demonstrated that LPS-induced brain injury was prevented by concurrent zinc treatment at the time of LPS exposure. In Chapter 4, the expression of activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) mRNA was identified as a marker of changes occurring in the fetus as a result of LPS exposure in early pregnancy. ADNP has been found to be essential for organogenesis and is a sensitive indicator of brain injury. Here it was demonstrated that LPS caused a rapid increase in embryonic ADNP expression, which was highly significant 24 hours after exposure. Whether the elevation in ADNP expression is in response to inflammatory damage or is induced by cytokines released by the maternal inflammatory response is not clear. However, a major finding of the study is that concomitant zinc treatment prevented the LPS-induced increase in ADNP activity. The mechanism of protection by zinc is presumed to be centred on preventing the fall in plasma zinc and associated fetal zinc deficiency caused by LPS induction of MT, but may also include MT-independent actions of zinc including prevention of apoptosis and oxidative damage, or enhance tissue repair processes. Taken together the findings in this thesis support earlier evidence that maternal MTmediated transient fetal zinc deficiency in early pregnancy underpins LPS-induced teratogenicity. This is the first study to demonstrate that this mechanism may also apply to LPS-induced neurodevelopmental damage in early and late pregnancy. However, further studies are warranted to discriminate between the influence of MT and that of other inflammatory reactants (e.g. cytokines) on LPS-mediated damage late in pregnancy. The major finding of the thesis is that zinc treatment (either given subcutaneously with LPS or as dietary zinc supplementation throughout pregnancy) prevents the negative fetal outcomes including neurodevelopmental damage caused by prenatal exposure to LPS. This finding highlights the importance of zinc nutrition in pregnancy and the benefits that might be gained as a potential prophylactic treatment to minimise fetal damage caused by infections during pregnancy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">infection; zinc; metallothionein; LPS; brain; abnormality; ADNP</field><field name="subject">Pregnancy.</field><field name="subject">Fetal development.</field><field name="subject">Zinc.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/56428</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Early life stages of the southern sea garfish, Hyporhamphus Melanochir (Valenciennes 1846), and their association with seagrass beds.</field><field name="creator">Noell, Craig J</field><field name="description">This study investigates early life stages of the southern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus melanochir) and their association with seagrass in Gulf St Vincent, South Australia. The overall aims were to identify and describe the early life stages of H. melanochir and to explore the possible relationship(s) between these life stages and seagrass habitat with the emphasis on seagrass as a requirement for spawning or as a food source. The reproductive biology of female H. melanochir from the commercial fishery was assessed by microscopic examination of ovaries, oocyte size distributions, gonadosomatic indices, and macroscopic ovarian stages. Five stages of oocyte development were identified and described: perinucleolar, yolk vesicle, yolk globule, migratory nucleus and hydrated. A coherence between histological and whole oocyte descriptions is demonstrated. Hyporhamphus melanochir are characterised as multiple spawners with group-synchronous oocyte development and indeterminate fecundity. A protracted spawning season from October to March was indicated by the occurrence of ripe ovaries and increases in gonadosomatic index. Females reach sexual maturity at 193 mm standard length, and batch fecundity ranged from 201-3044 oocytes depending on fish size. Spawning shoals are segregated by sex, as indicated by commercial samples, with a biased female-to-male ratio of 4.5:1 during the spawning season (1.2:1 during the non-spawning season). In addition, features of the oocyte surface were closely examined, which revealed that the filaments on the chorion of the hydrated oocyte are adhesive. These adhesive filaments presumably allow the fertilised egg to become attached to vegetative substrate by adhesion and/or entanglement. H. melanochir larvae were discriminated from another hemiramphid species, river garfish (H. regularis), which is also known to occur in the study area, based on species-specific amplification of part of the mitochondrial control region using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. The species were easily discerned by the number and distinct sizes of PCR products [H. melanochir, 443 bp; river garfish (H. regularis), 462 and 264 bp]. Although based on a single gene, this molecular method will correctly identify the species of individuals in at least 96% and 94% of tests for H. melanochir and H. regularis, respectively. Subsequent to verifying the identification of species by molecular discrimination, the larval development of H. melanochir and H. regularis were described. Larvae of H. melanochir and H. regularis had completed notochord flexion at hatching and are characterized by their elongate body with distinct rows of melanophores along the dorsal, lateral and ventral surfaces; small to moderate head; heavily pigmented, long straight gut; persistent preanal finfold; and extended lower jaw. Fin formation occurs in the sequence: caudal, dorsal and anal (almost simultaneously), pectoral, pelvic. Despite the similarities between both species and among hemiramphid larvae in general, H. melanochir larvae are distinguishable from H. regularis by: having 58-61 vertebrae (v. 51-54 for H. regularis); having 12-15 melanophore pairs in longitudinal rows along the dorsal margin between the head and origin of the dorsal fin (v. 19-22 for H. regularis); and the absence of a large ventral pigment blotch anteriorly on the gut and isthmus (present in H. regularis). A logistic regression analysis of body measurements also revealed interspecies differences in the combined measurements of eye diameter and pre-anal fin length. Both species can be distinguished from morphologically similar larvae found in southern Australia (other hemiramphids and a scomberosocid) by differences in meristic counts and pigmentation. Hyporhamphus melanochir larvae were successfully collected throughout Gulf St Vincent using a neuston net; however, attempts to sample eggs were unsuccessful. Abundances of larvae in the gulf averaged 4.8 and 12.3 larvae 1000&#8315; &#178; of surface water in December 1998 and December 2000, respectively. Larvae exhibit fast growth, as indicated by otolith growth increments, with backcalculated spawning dates falling within the October-March spawning season. Spatial analysis of larval distributions revealed a positive spatial autocorrelation, i.e. non-randomness or clustering of similar abundance values. Most larvae were found in the upper region of the gulf, and the prevalence of seagrass habitat throughout this region supports the view that the demersal eggs of H. melanochir become attached to seagrass and/or algae following spawning. A gyre in waters of the upper gulf, influenced by prevailing southerly winds, the Coriolis effect, and land boundaries, may explain retention of larvae. The importance of seagrass beds to H. melanochir spawning is also supported by anecdotal evidence and available literature on eggs of other Beloniformes, which are also demersal and attach to marine plants. Dual stable isotope analysis (&#948;&#185;&#179; and &#948;&#185;&#8309;N) of larval, juvenile and adult H. melanochir and several potential food sources from the Bay of Shoals was carried out to estimate the importance of zosteracean seagrass towards the assimilated diet of H. melanochir. Although the diet of H. melanochir larvae is probably planktonivorous, their isotopic signatures partly reflect the parental diet due to the influence of pre&amp;ndash;existing tissue in addition to growth. According to mixing model calculations, the signatures of juveniles can be explained by a diet consisting of 23&amp;ndash;37% Zostera, 0&amp;ndash;10% Halophila and the remainder zooplankton, whilst the diet of adults consists of 53&amp;ndash;58% Zostera and the remainder zooplankton. These findings indicate an increasing dependence upon Zostera with growth of H. melanochir. The results of this study enhance the completeness of our understanding of the fisheries biology and ecology of H. melanochir. Significant contributions are provided in reproductive biology and larval biology, seagrass beds (in combination with mixed algae) are demonstrated to be an important habitat for spawning, and Zostera seagrass is shown to be a necessary food source in the diet of juveniles and adults.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">garfish, gars, larvae, seagrasses</field><field name="subject">Fishes Breeding South Australia.</field><field name="subject">Seagrasses Australia South Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57972</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strawberry powdery mildew: epidemiology and the effect of host nutrition on disease.</field><field name="creator">Palmer, Sarah A.</field><field name="description">Knowledge of disease epidemiology and the impact of plant nutrient status on development of disease is fundamental in establishing effective management strategies for crop pathogens such as Podosphaera aphanis Br. (Braun et al., 2002), the causal agent of powdery mildew on strawberries. The following study investigated the conditions conducive for powdery mildew in strawberry crops in South Australia, the effect of foliar concentration of potassium and calcium on yield and pathogen development on the strawberry cultivars Aromas (resistant to powdery mildew) and Selva (susceptible), the potential for use of foliar-applied potassium silicate to control disease and identification of genes differentially expressed during disease. Meteorological conditions associated with establishment of powdery mildew were observed over three consecutive seasons in commercial strawberry crops grown in Woodside, South Australia. Conducive conditions appear to be &gt;28 oC, &lt;55 % relative humidity (RH) with no rain during the day (for conidiation), followed by a night with &gt;10 oC, &gt;90 % RH and no rain (for germination). Colony development was then promoted by days of &gt;15 oC and &lt;70 % RH, with nights of &gt;8 oC, &gt;80 % RH and less than 2 mm rain in every 24 hour period. These are consistent with epidemiological studies of this pathogen (Peries, 1962a; Jhooty and McKeen, 1964; Mukerji, 1968; Perera and Wheeler, 1975; Byrne et al, 2000; Miller et al, 2003; Blanco et al, 2004; Davik and Honne, 2005; Amsalem et al, 2006). This knowledge may facilitate prediction of times considered high risk for establishment of powdery mildew in strawberry crops. Subsequently, this may allow optimisation of fungicide application and improved management of this disease and reduced yield loss and management expenses. P. aphanis developed at an increased rate on leaves of Selva with low calcium content compared with development on normally fertilised leaves. Increased numbers of conidia germinated successfully on leaves of Aromas with low calcium content compared with development on normally fertilised Aromas leaves, however, the germinated conidia still failed to develop into sporulating colonies. Potassium nutrition had no obvious effect on P. aphanis development. Foliar concentration found to be adequate for growth of cultivars, Selva and Aromas were 6.0 mg/g and 4.5 mg/g Calcium, dry weight and 11.0 mg/g and 12.5 mg/g potassium, dry weight (respectively). Potassium silicate, buffered to pH 7.0 and applied as a foliar fertiliser, reduced the severity of powdery mildew below the economic threshold, though not below the disease severity on plants treated with the fungicide, Systhane&#174; (Bayer CropScience). As potassium silicate can be produced organically this compound may provide a useful management tool for both organic and conventional strawberry growers. Although the cultivar Aromas was not immune to disease under conducive conditions and high inoculum load in the field, inoculation of healthy Aromas plants with P. aphanis in the laboratory failed to produce disease. Conidia were seldom found attached to the leaf surface of healthy Aromas leaves. Germination and subsequent colony development were also not observed in inoculated samples. This suggests there is some mechanism of Aromas that inhibits development of this fungus. Preliminary investigation of differential expression in Aromas inoculated with P. aphanis, identified sequences with homology to a putative antimicrobial protein and photosynthesis-related genes. The results of these studies should enable growers to increase both crop yields and control of powdery mildew, one of the major economic diseases in South Australia. The epidemiological knowledge attained will be valuable, and may provide the basis for future forecast modelling for P. aphanis in strawberry crops in South Australia. Recommendations for calcium and potassium leaf content will allow growers to monitor their fertiliser regime for increased yield of these cultivars. Aromas was identified as a powdery mildew resistant cultivar potentially suitable for production in South Australia, and the genes associated with this resistance response may be used in studies of Fragaria species and breeding for powdery mildew resistant cultivars.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">strawberry; powdery mildew; epidemidogy; nutrition; calcium; potassium; silicon; Fragaria; Podosphaera aphanis</field><field name="subject">Strawberries Growth.</field><field name="subject">Strawberries Nutrition.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57974</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Totara Valley micro-hydro development : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Renewable Energy Engineering, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, David Ronald</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the design, construction and operation of a distributed generation system based on micro-hydro technology. The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expectations, emerging issues and change for Chinese international students in a New Zealand university : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Second Language Teaching at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Skyrme, Gillian Ray</field><field name="description">This study uses a sociocultural framework to trace the experiences of 24 Chinese international undergraduate students studying business and information sciences in a New Zealand university, using community of practice perspectives recognising the university as a site of complex discourses requiring negotiation of new identities and practices. The students&#8217; expectations, the issues that emerged and the processes of change they went through to meet their goals were investigated from retrospective and longitudinal viewpoints, using semi-structured interviews supported by schematic representations developed by the researcher and photographic representations compiled by participants were. The findings suggest that preparation before departure focused largely on expected English demands, rather than wider matters of academic culture, and this was only partially rectified during prior study in New Zealand. Students thus entered the university unfamiliar with its specific discourses and found conditions for resolving difficulties more limited than previously experienced. The anonymity and extreme time pressure pertaining in large first-year classes led to bewilderment about requirements, threats to the sense of identity as competent students which they had arrived with, and often, failure of courses. Nevertheless, the investment, personal and monetary, which this journey represented provided the incentive to persevere. Most students were resourceful in negotiating a fit between their learning preferences and the affordances of the university, resulting in very different journeys for each of them. Measures adopted included those sanctioned by the university, such as developing skills to meet the demands of academic literacies, and others less valued, such as extreme dependence on teacher consultation. Success was gained through personal agency which proved more important than the university goal of student autonomy. Beyond the academic arena, other activities such as part-time jobs were significant in contributing to a sense of identity as competent and educated adults, and to new viewpoints which contrasted with original cultural norms. They continued to identify as Chinese, but in a &#8220;third space&#8221; owing something to New Zealand influences. The study concludes that entry criteria should include a component of university preparation. It also recommends measures by which the university might enhance the experiences of such students.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese international students</field><field name="subject">university</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">social</field><field name="subject">cultural</field><field name="subject">sociocultural</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330199 Education studies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/793</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutritional characteristics of New Zealand export lamb and functional properties of selected beef forequarter muscles : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of technology in Bioprocess Engineering at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Jansen, Eion</field><field name="description">Richmond Ltd. has recently undergone a change in strategy, away from the traditional commodity based meat industry, towards the modern food business. To do this, opportunities to add value to their current product range must be identified. This involves the conversion of traditionally low value commodity based products into products that demand a premium. An example of this is converting muscles that are currently used for grinding meat into a further processed convenience food (i.e. ready meals). Another method is to add further value to premium products by making them more appealing to consumers (i.e. nutritional information on labels). This work details investigations into the functional properties of selected beef forequarter muscles (low value commodity products) and the nutritional properties of selected export lamb products (premium products). The functional properties of a number of beef forequarter muscles were measured to identify which had the best potential for further processing applications with respect to ready meals. The functional properties of tenderness, cook loss and shrinkage were measured for the Latissimus Dorsi, Pectorialis Profundus (Point End Brisket), Infraspinatus (Cross Cut Blade), Triceps Brachi Longhead (Main muscle in Bolar Shoulder Clod), Supraspinatus (Chuck Tender), Serratus Ventralis and Triceps Brachi Medialhead (Muscle in Bolar Shoulder Clod. From the tests conducted the Infraspinatus and the Triceps Brachi Longhead have been identified as having the best functional properties with respect to further processing for ready meal applications. As well as conducting tests to identify the forequarter muscles with the best potential for further processing applications, investigations were carried out to identify cooking regimes that would optimise the functional properties. This work confirmed that there are three major chemical reactions, which determine the resultant functional properties of cooked meat. They are the denaturation and aggregation of the myofibrillar proteins and the denaturation and solubilisation of connective tissue (collagen). At around 50&#176;C myosin (45% to 50% of the myofibrillar proteins) denatures, which results in a substantial increase in cook loss and reduction in water holding capacity. At around 60&#176;C collagen (main connective tissue protein) denatures, which results in a substantial increase in tenderness and increase in cook loss. This is because as the collagen denatures it loses it mechanical strength (increase in tenderness) and can no longer support its own structure, and causes it to contract. This contraction causes fluid within the meat and cook loss caused by the denaturation of myosin to be expelled from the meat by compressive forces (squeezed out). At around 70&#176;C actomyosin (22% of the myofibrillar proteins) denatures. This results in a substantial increase in the cook loss and firming of the meat. The increase in cook loss or decrease in water holding capacity that occurs with myofibrillar protein denaturation is due to the fact that when these proteins denature and aggregate their ability to bind water is greatly reduced. From the results of the cooking regime trials it is recommended that for functional property considerations that during the cooking of further processed meat products (i.e. ready meal applications) a meat temperature of 62&#176;C should be aimed for, for the slowest heating region during cooking (usually the centre). This is because it has been identified that a cooking temperature of 65&#176;C should not be exceeded otherwise detrimental effects can occur to the functional properties of the cooked meat. For health concerns a 7D bacterial death reduction has to be achieved. This means that for a cooking temperature of 62&#176;C the meat has to be held at this temperature for at least 5 minutes. Therefore the total cooking time would be the time needed to heat all the meat to 62&#176;C plus 5 minutes to ensure a safe product. The heating or cooking system employed should also ensure that a minimal amount of the meat is heated above 65&#176;C. This can be easily achieved by minimising the external cooking temperature, but long cooking times will result. An industrial cooking process will be a compromise between the cost associated with longer residence time and product functionality. As mentioned earlier another way to add value is to supply nutritional information for selected cuts. Consequentially one of the objectives of this project was to provide some nutritional information for selected meat cuts. Though the primary objective of this part of the project was to develop a method for producing the needed information, so that Richmond N.Z. Ltd. can develop further information on an as needs basis. The nutritional characteristics of a number of export lamb cuts from the saddle region has also been investigated and a method devised to allow further characterisation of other cuts. The method involves breaking down a standard cut into its constituent components (e.g. Frenched rack consists of loin eye, fat cap, intercostals and fatty tissue). The constituent components are tested for their nutritional properties. The frenched rack nutritional properties are calculated from the nutritional properties of the constituents components and the yield data (percentage of each constituent component within a frenched rack) for frenched racks. This method allowed the identification of the main sources of variation for nutritional characteristics. These differences were found to be caused by the lean to fat ratio, not nutritional differences in lean tissue from the same region of lamb (i.e. loin eye and tenderloin very similar nutritionally). The difference in lean to fat ration also accounts for the variation between grades (i.e. PX grade lamb cuts have a higher fat content than YX grade lamb cuts due to PX grade cuts having a higher percentage fat tissue in their cuts). The cuts characterised were the shortloin section (whole section or chop), rack section (whole section or chop), 75mm racks frenched 25mm, boneless loin and tenderloin for both PX and YX grade lamb. The method will be applicable to other regions of lamb (i.e. hindquarter and forequarter) for which nutritional information already exists, but for which yielding data will have to be collected. The method would also be applicable to other species such as beef and venison, but both nutritional data for constituent components and yielding data would have to be collected.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Infraspinatus</field><field name="subject">Triceps Brachi Longhead</field><field name="subject">ready meals</field><field name="subject">cooked meat</field><field name="subject">protein denaturation</field><field name="subject">nutritional properties</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290103 Food processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/895</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who talks, what they talk about, and how much they say : a study of bulletin structure and source use in New Zealand free-to-air television news programmes : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management in Communication Management, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Macdonald, Julie Susan</field><field name="description">Free-to-air television news is an accessible and popular means through which audiences can gain knowledge and understanding about the world. Therefore, the nature of the news provided has important implications for the opportunities audiences have to become informed about events and issues, and to use this knowledge to participate in social decision-making. The structure and content of news bulletins reflect the decisions made by broadcasters about the topics that are considered to be important, and which sources should have the opportunity to be represented. Thus, the goal of this research was to compare the structure and content of the news provided by New Zealand&#8217;s national free-to-air news programmes; ONE News (TVNZ), 3 News (TV3), Prime News (Prime Television), and Te K ea (M ori Television). A content analysis of one constructed week of the four news programmes was undertaken, focusing on four general areas of interest. First, the profile of the news bulletins was examined (i.e., the proportion of the bulletin allocated to different segments of the news, the duration of main news stories, the origin of production of main news stories, the proportion of New Zealand and international news, and the topics included in the news). Second, the research investigated the identity of the types of sources selected by the broadcasters for inclusion in locally produced main news stories. Third, the frequency and duration of &#233;lite and non-&#233;lite source speech was examined. Finally, the extent to which journalists speak on camera in news stories was also investigated. The study showed that the four programmes generally conformed to the &#8216;standard profile&#8217; of modern television news bulletins; the programmes included considerable amounts of non-news content and the news topics often reflected entertainment values, rather than focusing on serious issues. A further significant characteristic of the bulletins was that &#233;lite sources were more likely to be included in news stories on all programmes and generally had greater opportunities to speak. However, in many respects it appears that Te K ea provides an alternative news bulletin compared to the other three channels, by focusing on a wider range of news topics, including more non-&#233;lite sources in stories, and giving all sources considerably more time to share their views. Te K ea seems to broadcast a news programme that makes a compromise between the entertainment values which are entrenched in contemporary television news, and the broader M ori Television mandate to inform and educate the public. This contrasts with the more homogenous (in terms of the characteristics examined in this research) news programmes offered by the ONE News, 3 News, and Prime News. This study concludes that the nationally available free-to-air news programmes currently broadcast on New Zealand television fulfil the traditional news functions of informing and educating the public in only a very narrow sense. The deregulated news environment is poised to undergo further transformation with an anticipated increase in convergence among news media and the emergence of more television news providers. The challenge within this commercial environment is for ONE News, 3 News, Prime News, and Te K ea to deliver on their stated commitments to provide information and promote debate on the important issues of the day.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">news bulletins</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">public broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anthelmintic treatment and digestive organ morphology of captive-reared kaki (Himantopus novaezelandiae) released to the wild : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Robertson, Louise Mary</field><field name="description">The continued existence of New Zealand&#8217;s critically endangered and endemic black stilt or kak&#239; (Himantopus novaezelandiae) relies on an intensive captive management programme. While this is successful at rearing large numbers of birds for release to the wild, poor survivability of these birds is limiting significant increases in the wild population. Predation and starvation are suspected to be the most common causes of death in released birds, but underlying contributing factors to these mortalities have not been fully evaluated. This research investigates the possible contribution of gastrointestinal (GI) helminth burdens and suboptimal digestive organ development to the high mortality rates of released kak&#239;. Emphasis is placed on evaluating the methods used to assess the importance of these factors and to make informed recommendations for future management. The efficacy of the anthelmintic regime used for kak&#239; was assessed by dosing half of the 80 captive birds with praziquantel (PZQ) prior to release in 2007. Faecal samples were collected before and after anthelmintic treatment, and before and after release to the wild. Post mortem worm counts were conducted on 11 birds that died following release and historical worm count records dating back to 1997 were accessed. The main findings were: PZQ had high efficacy against trematodes; treatment did not prevent re-infection; birds were exposed to helminths at release site; and there was no advantage of treatment for survival. Overall, the results suggest that anthelmintic treatment is an unnecessary cost. Consequently, recommendations were made to cease anthelmintic treatment or reduce its intensity, continue health screening, and incorporate annual efficacy testing to monitor the emergence of anthelmintic resistance. The reliability of faecal screening for GI helminths was evaluated. Faecal egg counts (FECs) were found to be poor indicators of worm burden. The two modified sedimentation methods used to detect trematodes provided relatively low egg recovery rates. Trematode egg shedding varied between days but not by hour of the day or temperature. The collection and analysis of pooled faecal samples proved to be more cost and time-effective than samples from individual birds and the larger masses collected resulted in greater sensitivity. In conclusion, faecal analysis of pooled samples is a useful qualitative indicator of helminth presence or absence but is quantitatively unreliable. In order to assess the importance of digestive organ development to captive-reared and released kak?, the digestive organs of healthy and emaciated captive, released and wild Himantopus sp. were compared. Captive and released kak? had generally smaller digestive organs than wild birds, released birds did not increase digestive organ size to match the high fibre wild diet, and emaciated birds did not have atrophied organs. However, the greatest mortality rates occur soon after release, while the birds were still being supplementary fed. These results suggest that reduced digestive efficiency is probably not contributing significantly to mortality rates and the direct impacts of the translocation are probably greater risk factors. The continued provision of supplementary food to released birds and an increased focus on habitat enhancement and predator control at release sites were recommended. The reliability of comparing fresh and formalin fixed Himantopus sp. gut specimens was evaluated. Significant differences in fresh and formalin fixed organ dry masses and variation in preserved organ lengths indicate that this variation should be considered in future studies. In conclusion, current management practices appear to be successful in ensuring that GI helminths and reduced digestive efficiency do not significantly lower the survivorship of captive-reared and released kak&#239;. There is a need for further research into developing a more direct physiological assessment of the impacts of GI helminths and gut morphology as well as considering the role that starvation may have on poor survivability.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">black stilt</field><field name="subject">captive management</field><field name="subject">endangered species</field><field name="subject">gastrointestinal helminth</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300805 Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accelerating classifier training using AdaBoost within cascades of boosted ensembles : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Sciences at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Susnjak, Teo</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to address current problems encountered when training classifiers within the framework of cascades of boosted ensembles (CoBE). At present, a signifi- cant challenge facing this framework are inordinate classifier training runtimes. In some cases, it can take days or weeks (Viola and Jones, 2004; Verschae et al., 2008) to train a classifier. The protracted training runtimes are an obstacle to the wider use of this framework (Brubaker et al., 2006). They also hinder the process of producing effective object detection applications and make the testing of new theories and algorithms, as well as verifications of others research, a considerable challenge (McCane and Novins, 2003). An additional shortcoming of the CoBE framework is its limited ability to train clas- sifiers incrementally. Presently, the most reliable method of integrating new dataset in- formation into an existing classifier, is to re-train a classifier from beginning using the combined new and old datasets. This process is inefficient. It lacks scalability and dis- cards valuable information learned in previous training. To deal with these challenges, this thesis extends on the research by Barczak et al. (2008), and presents alternative CoBE frameworks for training classifiers. The alterna- tive frameworks reduce training runtimes by an order of magnitude over common CoBE frameworks and introduce additional tractability to the process. They achieve this, while preserving the generalization ability of their classifiers. This research also introduces a new framework for incrementally training CoBE clas- sifiers and shows how this can be done without re-training classifiers from beginning. However, the incremental framework for CoBEs has some limitations. Although it is able to improve the positive detection rates of existing classifiers, currently it is unable to lower their false detection rates.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CoBE framework</field><field name="subject">classifiers</field><field name="subject">classification algorithms</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280212 Neural networks, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The physiological and molecular response to repeated sprints in male and female team-sport athletes : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Sport and Exercise Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Dent, Jessica</field><field name="description">Background: Due to the unique demands of the sport, athletes playing football perform a variety of differing training methods to improve physiological performance. These include strength, endurance and sprint training. While the effects of strength and endurance training have been well researched, the effects of repeated-sprint training on blood and muscle variables in well trained males and females are not well known. An understanding of changes to the blood and muscle during and following an exercise bout are important, so to gain an understanding of the type of stress and resulting adaptations that may occur. Also, while a large volume of research in training adaptations has been performed on males; little has been done on females. To date, some research indicates metabolism during moderateintensity exercise may differ between males and females; however, no study has compared repeated-sprint exercise. Therefore, it is unclear as to whether males and females would have a differing physiological response to repeated-sprint training. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a repeated-sprint bout on molecular signalling in muscle and blood measures and heart rate in well-trained footballers. Additionally, we compared running times and sprint decrement (%). Research Design: Eight female senior University football players (Mean &#177; SD, age, 19 &#177; 1 y, VO ? 2peak 53.0 &#177; 5.1 ml&#183;kg-1min-1) and seven male senior University football players (Mean &#177; SD, age, 19 &#177; 3 y, VO ? 2peak 59.0 &#177; 6.6 ml&#183;kg-1min-1) volunteered to participate in this study. Participants performed four bouts of 6 x 30 m maximal sprints spread equally over a 40 min period. Sprint time was measured (at 30 m) for each sprint and sprint decrement was also calculated for all bouts. Muscle biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis muscle at rest, 15 min following exercise and 2 h into recovery. Venous blood samples were taken at the same time points as the biopsies while capillary blood lactate was measured at rest and 3 min following each sprint bout. Repeated measures ANOVA and Post hoc t-tests were performed to determine significant differences between the two groups (male vs. female) and time points. Findings: Both groups had a significant (P&lt;0.05) increase in blood lactate (mM) after the first bout of repeated sprints, with no differences between females (pre 0.9 &#177; 0.4 mM &#8211; post 10.0 &#177; 1.6 mM) and males (pre 0.8 &#177; 0.3 mM &#8211; post 10.0 &#177; 3.5 mM). Blood lactate remained elevated compared to rest (P&lt;0.05) following bouts 2, 3 and 4 for both females (12.0 &#177; 3.6, 12.0 &#177; 3.3, 12.2 &#177; 3.8 mM respectively) and males (11.9 &#177; 2.9, 11.6 &#177; 2.3, 11.5 &#177; 4.0 mM respectively), with no differences between groups or time points (P&gt;0.05). There were no differences (P&gt;0.05) between the female and male athletes in mean heart rate attained at the end of each bout of repeated sprints (187 &#177; 2 v 190 &#177; 2 bpm respectively) or during recovery between sprints (140 &#177; 2 v 130 &#177; 2 bpm respectively). There were no differences between groups or time points in blood insulin (P&gt;0.05). Fastest 30 m sprint time and mean 30 m sprint time during the repeated-sprint bout was faster for the males than females (4.58 &#177; 0.12 v 5.26 &#177; 0.27 s respectively; (P&gt;0.05)). However, there were no differences in running velocity during the sprints between the males and females (165 &#177; 0.4 % vs. 155 &#177; 0.05 %; P&gt;0.05) when expressed relative to velocity at VO ? 2peak (vVO ? 2peak). Also, mean % decrement during the repeated-sprint bout was lower in the males then females (4.9 &#177; 1.3 v 7.1 &#177; 1.9 % respectively; P&lt;0.05). No changes were observed in total or phosphorylated Akt at any time-point or between genders. However, while total 4E-BP1 was lower, the ratio of total to phosphoryalated 4E-BP1 at rest was greater in males than females (P&lt;0.05). Finally, there was also a significant decrease in 4E-BP1 phosphorylation post-exercise in males (P&lt;0.05), but not females. Conclusions: There were no sex differences in blood lactate or heart rate throughout the repeated-sprint bout. These findings suggest that there were no cardio respiratory or lactate production/clearance differences in the response to a repeated-sprint-training bout between sexes. However, while males were faster than their female counterparts, the average relative speed was similar between sexes, suggesting a similar relative volume of work was performed during the sprint bouts. However, the females did have a greater decrement in sprint performance indicating a greater ability to recover sprint performance in the males. Sex differences in resting total and phosphorylated 4E-BP1 may indicate greater potential for muscle growth in the male athletes during basal conditions. However, differences could be due to factors other than sex, including previous training history. There was a lack of change in plasma insulin or Akt, but, similar to resistance exercise, a significant decrease in post-exercise 4E-BP1 phosphorylation for the males, but not females. The sex differences in the 4E-BP1 phosphorylation response post-exercise could be due to differences in the metabolic disturbance in the muscle during and following maximal sprints.

In New Zealand, one of the biggest industrial energy efficiency projects was started in 2002 by a multinational dairy company, the Fonterra Co-operative Group, in partnership with the energy service company Demand Response Ltd; the project currently aims at reducing by 15% the energy costs at all Fonterra&#8217;s major production sites throughout the country. This thesis, undertaken as part of the above project, examines the development and implementation of a structured and integrated energy monitoring and targeting methodology (M&amp;T) for the most efficient operation of all Fonterra&#8217;s chilled water systems, with an initial focus on the ones installed at Clandeboye, one of the Fonterra&#8217;s sites involved in the energy saving project. A data collection system (Insite) was already in place at Clandeboye to enable storage and analysis of some of the site&#8217;s utility metering data. After identification of key chilled water system components and definition of data requirements for M&amp;T purposes, an analysis of past energy consumption trends (based on multiple regression calculations) was carried out to develop an historical benchmark of the energy used, compare it with current energy performance and thus identify opportunities for future improvements. The creation of an M&amp;T reporting system for presenting findings to operators and management was the last essential part of the thesis development. The study has highlighted that the robustness of the proposed regression model was badly affected by the unreliability of the existing data collection system and the uncertainty associated with poorly documented changes to operating conditions/plant configuration that had occurred over time. The conclusion is that, while the developed M&amp;T methodology is theoretically valid and readily applicable, further developments are necessary (and recommended) to make it suitable for other similar systems.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dairy processing</field><field name="subject">Industrial refrigeration</field><field name="subject">Chilled water systems</field><field name="subject">Energy monitoring and targeting methodology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1420</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Digital reporting formats and users of financial reports : decision quality, perceptions and cognitive information processing in the context of recognition versus disclosure : a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Accountancy, Massey University</field><field name="creator">Ghani, Erlane K.</field><field name="description">The evolvement of digital reporting has changed the way financial information is prepared and disseminated (Debreceny and Gray, 200 1 ). Previous research has shown that digital reporting has increased, particularly in the last five years, and this usage is characterised by greater volumes of business and financial information over that traditionally provided in print-based mode (Smith, 2003). The new opportunities and benefits offered by digital reporting are matched by challenges and implications not only for the preparers and auditors but also for users. It is expected that in the near future, financial reporting will move entirely from the primarily print-based mode to digital-based mode as the primary information dissemination channel (Oyelere et aI., 2003; Fisher et aI., 2004). Research in the area of digital reporting has been conducted in the past decade. Within this research, a considerable number of issues have been raised. These issues relate to various parties, such as policy makers, preparers, auditors, system designers and users. While several research questions and hypotheses concerning these parties have been posed and investigated, most of the research questions and hypotheses have been formed from a preparers' perspective, leaving the examination of issues from a users' perspective largely unexplored. This study focuses on users. It examines the effect of presentation formats on decision makers' performance in relation to decision quality, perceptions and cognitive information processing in the digital reporting environment. It aims to extend the digital reporting literature. This study extends the existing body of knowledge on digital reporting environment in several ways. First, this study examines the effect of presentation formats on the quality of users' decision making. This study follows Kleinmuntz and Schkade (1993) who described 'decision quality' in the context of two cost-benefit dimensions in relation to decision makers' cognitive processes, namely decision accuracy and cognitive effort. Decision accuracy reflects the ability of a strategy to produce an accurate outcome while cognitive effort reflects the total cognitive expenditure incurred in completing a task. Second, this study examines users' perceptions of three digital presentation formats: PDF, HTML and XBRL. This study compares subjects' perceptions of usefulness and ease of use of the three presentation formats with their actual outcome. It also includes examining whether perceptions are an important factor in influencing preferred presentation format. Finally, this study examines whether digital presentation formats address the concern over functional fixation in the accounting context of 'recognition versus disclosure' in the reporting of financial information. This study used public accounting practitioners in New Zealand as participants. Sixty two subjects participated in the experiment, which involves an experiment exercise and a post experiment questionnaire. The results indicate that presentation formats impact on decision accuracy. This finding is consistent with previous studies conducted using non-digital presentation formats such as tabular and graphical in the psychology and information systems literature (Stock and Watson, 1984; Dickson et aI., 1986; Iselin, 1988; DeSanctis and Jarvenpaa, 1989; Mackay and Villareal, 1987; Hard and Vanacek, 1991; Stone and Schkade, 1991; Anderson and Kaplan, 1992; Bricker and Nehmer, 1995; Ramarapu et aI., 1997; Frownfelter-Lohrke, 1998; Almer et aI., 2003). The results, however, indicate that presentation formats do not impact decision makers' cognitive effort. These findings suggest that preparers, standardsetters and regulatory bodies should recognise that presentation format impacts on users' decision making processes and select appropriate formats that lead to improvement in decision making. Additionally, the results indicate that users' perceptions of the usefulness and ease of use of the reporting technologies are similar across the three presentation formats. The results also show that users' perceptions do not necessary correspond to actual performance. Users' perceptions are found to influence their preferred presentation format. The findings of this study provide useful insights on users' perceptions, performances and preferences of the digital presentation formats. Such results provide a holistic and comprehensive view of the importance of perceptions and the effect of presentation formats on decision makers' performance. This is particularly relevant since if more advanced forms of digital reporting are to be encouraged, then there is also the need for users to be made more aware of the benefits to be gained from the different forms of presentation. Finally, the results show that of the four recognised stages of information processing (i.e. acquisition, evaluation, weighting and judging information), functional fixation is found to only exist at the judgment stage. However, the effect of presentation format is only significant at information evaluation stage. The results indicate that the interaction between presentation formats and placement of information does not affect decision makers' information processing. This suggests that presentation formats do not solve the concern about recognition versus disclosure (functional fixation) in information processing stages. These fmdings are not consistent with Hodge et al. (2004) but are consistent with Luft and Shields (2001) who suggest functional fixation could not be alleviated because the accounting itself would affect the allocation of people's attention. This study extends the literature on presentation format by examining the quality of decision making arising from the use of different presentation formats in a digital reporting environment. It provides evidence that users' perceptions of ease of use of a presentation format do not necessarily correspond to their actual performance (cognitive effort) once a particular task has been performed. This study also provides evidence that the acceptance of a technology is highly dependent on the perceptions of that technology. Therefore, limited knowledge and appreciation of the capabilities of a technology may have the undesired effect of deterring use of the technology although it may improve performance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Decision-making</field><field name="subject">Technology acceptance</field><field name="subject">Human-computer interaction</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350100 Accounting, Auditing and Accountability</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1381</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The human myostatin precursor protein : structure, function and amyloid formation : implications for the muscle wastage disease sporadic inclusion body myositis : a dissertation presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Biochemistry at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Starck, Carlene Sheree</field><field name="description">Myostatin is a major player in the regulation of mammalian muscle growth and development, maintaining the balance between proliferation and differentiation prenatally and the quiescence of satellite cells in adults. An absence or overexpression of myostatin results in double-muscling and cachexia respectively, placing myostatin as a promising target in the treatment of muscle wastage diseases. As a transforming growth factor-&#946; superfamily member, myostatin is produced as a precursor protein, consisting of a propeptide region N-terminal to the growth factor domain. Cleavage of the precursor between the domains forms the myostatin latent complex, an inhibitory structure which is exported from the cell where a second cleavage event releases the active myostatin growth factor. The precursor protein, propeptide, and latent complex play important roles in the regulation of myostatin. However, their structure and function are poorly understood, and a possible role for the myostatin precursor protein in the muscle wastage disease sporadic inclusion body myositis, suggests that pre-growth factor forms of myostatin may be additional important therapeutic targets. This thesis presents an investigation into the structure and function of the myostatin precursor protein, the latent complex, and the propeptide region within these, with comparisons to a mutant form of myostatin responsible for the naturally-occurring double-muscled phenotype of the Piedmontese cattle breed. Results suggest that the diverse functions of the propeptide region are facilitated by regions of intrinsic disorder within a primarily structured domain, and that conformational alterations accompany the precursor to latent complex transition, resulting in a tighter inhibitory structure. Comparative analyses between the wild-type and mutant proteins suggest that the Piedmontese phenotype is due to a reduced capacity for covalent dimerisation and significant structural alterations within the type I receptor-binding domain. Investigation into misfolded myostatin precursor protein found that the precursor is able to form cytotoxic amyloid aggregates and mature fibrils under partially denaturing conditions, suggesting a possible mechanism for the role of the myostatin precursor in sporadic inclusion body myositis. Together, these novel results contribute important information towards an understanding of myostatin structure, function and regulation in both normal and disease scenarios.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Myostatin precursor protein</field><field name="subject">Muscle wastage disease</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1408</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The improvisation of Tubby Hayes in 'The New York Sessions' : exegesis submitted in partial fulfilment of a Masters in Musicology, New Zealand School of Music</field><field name="creator">Alton-Lee, Amity Rose</field><field name="description">Audio files not uploaded onto institutional repository due to copyright restrictions: Hayes, T. &amp; Clark, T.

The relative importance of these mites and damage caused by them in Australia has markedly increased in the last decade, and pest reports indicate extensive damage to a variety of winter grain crops and pastures. Furthermore, pest reports suggest that these mites have been difficult to control in the field, with some pesticides described as being ineffective. Despite this, there is very little information about the biology and control of these species, making it difficult to devise effective and sustainable management strategies.

Kopara to investigate the lack of compensation by later determined components of yield because of early disease constraints. The investigation was based on the hypothesis that early disease reduces root development and thus causes the plants to be water constrained at later growth stages when soil water deficits usually occur. The reduced root development and soil water deficits may reduce the ability of the plant to compensate for reductions in early determined components. The hypothesis was tested by the application of irrigation to alleviate water stress.  In a disease free crop, the possible phytotonic effects of the fungicides benomyl and triadimefon on wheat were investigated. These fungicides had no phytotonic effects on shoot, root growth, or yield under the prevailing conditions. The effect of disease on root development was analysed by root length measurements. Disease present in the crop at any stage of growth affected root development. Root development in the upper zones of the soil profile was reduced more by disease compared to those zones below 35 cm. A full disease epidemic reduced root development more than an early or late disease epidemic. The early and late disease epidemics had similar effects on root length. Alleviation of early disease constraints enabled greater development of roots to offset any earlier reductions.  Soil water deficits increased root development in the lower zones of the nil disease plants. The presence of adequate soil water from irrigation reduced the requirement for further root growth in all treatments.  In the 1981-1982 field trial a full disease epidemic reduced yield by 14% whereas an early disease epidemic reduced yield by 7%. The reduction in yield was attributed to a lower grain number. With irrigation the yield reduction in the full disease plants was 12% whereas in the early disease plants the reduction was only 2.4%. This indicated that plants affected by the early disease epidemic were water constrained. In this study, the results suggested that, for conditions prevailing in Canterbury, the supply of water at later growth stages increased grain weight in plants which were subject to early disease epidemics. This suggests that reduced root development caused by early disease and soil water deficits may prevent compensation by grain weight.  Water use was similar in all disease treatments. After irrigation the irrigated plants of all treatments used more water. Disease affected water use in relation to yield production however, and was better expressed by water use efficiency. Water use efficiency was reduced in the full disease plants. A stepwise regression analysis suggested that water use efficiency was affected directly by disease at later growth stages, and indirectly via an effect on total green leaf area at early growth stages.  This study partially proves the hypothesis that reductions in root development caused by an early disease epidemic may constrain the plants at later growth stages when water deficits usually occur. It was shown that the reduction in root development caused by disease could be counteracted by irrigation. In this respect, water served as a tool to study the effect of disease constraints on the yield of wheat.  A knowledge of cereal crop physiology, root growth and function is used to explain and discuss the observations made in this research programme. The results are discussed in relation to the way in which disease affects yield through its effect on root development. The possible reasons for the continued effects of disease even after the control of disease at later growth stages are discussed. The economic use of fungicides and water in diseased crops are also outlined.  Suggestions for future studies on disease-yield loss relationships are provided. The repetition of these experiments in different sites and climatic regions could provide information which may be incorporated in disease-yield loss simulation models. This could then be used to predict root development and water requirements of diseased plants, and provide a basis for economic use of fungicides and water, and for better disease management programmes.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wheat</field><field name="subject">foliar disease</field><field name="subject">disease assessment</field><field name="subject">root development</field><field name="subject">fungicides</field><field name="subject">phytotonic</field><field name="subject">water use</field><field name="subject">water use efficiency</field><field name="subject">water deficit</field><field name="subject">stripe rust</field><field name="subject">speckled leaf blotch</field><field name="subject">yield</field><field name="subject">yield components</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production::300204 Plant protection (pests, diseases and weeds)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany::270403 Plant pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1514</field></doc><doc><field name="title">International marketing relationships : an alternative view</field><field name="creator">Williams, L. E.</field><field name="description">This study began with the observation that international marketing research (IMR) lacked a human face. A literature search confirmed this view. The review was thus widened to include international marketing (IM) studies of culture, cognition, and communication, since they were thought to underpin all human interactions. This step, it was believed, would help clarify marketing scholars' understanding of these encounters. Analysis established that not only were there few studies in these areas, but they also focused on dyads, prediction, and control. To establish how this research had evolved in this way and how it could best be extended, an exploration of how knowledge is created followed. This culminated in my understanding that the culture in mainstream marketing circles was responsible for the lack of development of IM relationship research. A decision was therefore made to study this area from an alternative perspective to the positivist approach typically adopted. An interpretive study of small business in a developing country and their overseas buyer was undertaken to that end. In total, more than eleven months fieldwork was conducted in Indonesia. The resulting interpretation was compared to the existing IM relationship research. The literature was then again extended to examine non-marketing studies that may help explain field findings that could not be explained by existing IMR. It was suggested that IM scholars needed to question whether the values and assumptions underlying their research, are appropriate in a global context.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">international market research</field><field name="subject">marketing</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">cognition</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">relationships</field><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="subject">1505 - Marketing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/2093</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of nutrition and body composition on milk production in the grazing ewe</field><field name="creator">Geenty, Kennett Gordon</field><field name="description">Two experiments were conducted to examine the interrelationships between body composition at parturition, herbage allowance during lactation and milk production. Detailed measurements of feed intake and changes in body composition allowed estimates of maintenance energy requirement and efficiency of use of energy for milk production.  Dorset ewes were offered low (L-) or high (H-) herbage allowances during pregnancy to achieve post-partum body weights, respectively, of about 50 and 60-65 kg. During the first 6 weeks of lactation herbage allowances were approximately 2 (-L), 5 (-M and -Mm) and 8 (-H) kg DM/ewe/d and feed intake was determined using chromic oxide dilution. In the first experiment (Expt.A) ewes were machine-milked and in the second (Expt.B) they were suckled by twin lambs with a further group (-Mm) machine-milked. Samples of ewes were slaughtered during early pregnancy, post-partum, and after 6 weeks of lactation.  Body weight differences post-partum between L- and H- groups were 10 and 15 kg in Expts.A and B respectively. During lactation body weight changes appeared erratic, particularly in Expt.B, owing to the effects of variation in gut fill.  Daily feed intake of machine-milked ewes on -M and -H allowances reached a maximum (1.9-2.2 kg OM/ewe/d) 2-3 weeks after parturition but ewes rearing lambs on similar allowances showed maximum intake (2.5-2.8 kg OM/ewe/d) during the first week. Mean intakes during lactation were 58, 69 and 73 g DOM/kg W&#8226;&#8311;&#8309;/d respectively for -L, -M and -H groups machine-milked and 51, 75 and 83 g DOM/kg W&#8226;&#8311;&#8309;/d respectively for -L, -M and -H groups rearing twin lambs. In both experiments ewes in L- groups had approximately 14% greater mean intake (g DOM/kg W&#8226;&#8311;&#8309;/d) during lactation compared with those in H- groups. Mean daily milk production of ewes rearing lambs was 2.0, 2.5 and 2.7 kg/d respectively in -L, -M and -H groups and was 33-52% greater than that for machine-milked ewes offered similar herbage allowances. In both experiments L- ewes had 14% greater milk yield (g/kg W&#8226;&#8311;&#8309;/d) compared with H- ewes. Mean lamb growth rates in Expt.B averaged 209, 254 and 268 g/lamb/d in -L, -M and -H groups, respectively. Lambs in the H- group were approximately 11% heavier at birth than those in the L- group and their mean growth rate was 20 g/d greater.  Body fat and energy content of live ewes at the start of lactation was predicted using regression relationships from ewes slaughtered post-partum. There was large variation in the energy content of body weight loss during lactation (-37 to +140 MJ/kg) owing to variation in weight of gut fill and changes in chemical composition of the empty body.  In Expt.A the body fat content of ewes during early pregnancy was 16.9 kg. Predicted values post-partum were 10.0 and 15.7 kg in L- and H- groups, respectively. During lactation all groups showed body fat losses which ranged from 53 (LH) to 120 g/d (HL). Body fat content during early pregnancy in Expt.B was slightly greater (19.0 kg) than in Expt.A and predicted values post-partum were 11.5 (L-) and 19.7 kg (H-). Fat mobilization during lactation was greater than in Expt.A, and ranged from 157 (LH) to 287 g/d (HL). In both experiments there were losses in body protein during pregnancy in L- ewes (5 and 15 g/d in Expts.A and B respectively). During lactation, protein losses were most evident in H- ewes, being greatest in HL groups (26 and 43 g/d in Expts.A and B respectively). Water: protein ratio in the empty body showed a progressive increase during pregnancy and lactation in both experiments. Estimated maintenance energy requirement for machine-milked ewes tended to be greater for H- (.236 MJ ME/kg W/d) compared with L- ewes (.205 MJ ME/kg W/d) but was similar for both groups of ewe rearing lambs (average of.238 MJ ME/kg W/d). Efficiency of use of ME above maintenance for milk production (K&#8321;) in L- and H- groups was, respectively, .69 and .95 in machine-milked, and .69 and .64 in suckled ewes. Energy from mobilized body tissues was utilized for milk production with respective efficiencies in L- and H- ewes of .23 and .35 in machine-milked, and .40 and .50 in suckled ewes. Efficiency of conversion of total energy available (i.e. ME above maintenance and mobilized tissue energy) to milk energy (K&#8321;(t)) when compared among all groups in both experiments, tended to decrease (from .84 to .51) with increasing body energy mobilization. There was a positive relationship, however, between K&#8321;(t) and the proportion of mobilized energy derived from body protein.  Metabolizable energy intakes in the present experiments appeared to be 10-15% greater than calculated requirements from ARC (1980). Estimates of ME requirements for lactating ewes at pasture, in relation to body weight, level of milk production and body energy change, have been calculated based on the present data.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lactation</field><field name="subject">milk production</field><field name="subject">ewe</field><field name="subject">sheep</field><field name="subject">grazing</field><field name="subject">body composition</field><field name="subject">herbage</field><field name="subject">070206 - Animal Reproduction</field><field name="subject">070204 - Animal Nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/2100</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of thyroid hormones in the neuroendocrine control of seasonal reproduction in red deer hinds</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Greg Muir</field><field name="description">A series of eight experiments was conducted to investigate the requirement for thyroid hormones in neuroendocrine processes which lead to the seasonally anoestrous state in red deer hinds.  The first two experiments used thyroidectomized, ovariectomized, oestradiol-treated hinds which received various thyroid hormone replacement treatments (n=5 per group) to investigate the timing and dose-responsiveness of thyroid hormones in bringing about seasonal oestradiol-induced suppression of plasma LH concentration. A significant seasonal decline in mean plasma LH concentration during September (coinciding with the onset of anoestrus in entire cycling hinds in New Zealand) was observed in all thyroidectomized hinds in both experiments regardless of T&#8324; or T&#8323; treatment. When oestradiol implants were removed in November or December, mean plasma LH concentrations increased significantly in all but one of hinds in which T&#8324; had been administered at very low doses by subcutaneous implants, and mean plasma LH concentrations and LH pulse amplitude increased in approximately half of hinds administered T&#8323; at varying doses by subcutaneous injections over a one-week period in October. These results suggested that thyroid hormones are not required for steroid-dependent reproductive suppression, but could possibly play a role in steroid-independent suppression of LH secretion. Because problems were encountered in delivering appropriate doses of thyroid hormones in both experiments, further confirmation of these findings was required. Therefore in the next experiment the role of thyroid gland secretions was examined in euthyroid (n=5) and thyroidectomized (n=4) ovariectomized hinds treated with oestradiol implants. These implants were removed for about one month on three occasions to examine the effect of thyroidectomy on steroid-independent control of seasonal LH secretion. During the non-breeding season basal and GnRH-induced plasma LH concentrations declined in all hinds in the presence of oestradiol, but returned to breeding season levels when oestradiol was withdrawn in November. In a concurrent experiment, thyroidectomy of ovary-entire hinds (n=7) during the breeding season prevented the cessation of oestrous cyclicity in spring; this was in contrast to oestrous cyclicity in T&#8324;replaced (n=4) or euthyroid control (n=5) hinds which ceased to occur in early September. Collectively, these results indicate that thyroid hormones are required for the termination of the breeding season in cycling red deer hinds and that this action occurs via steroid-independent neuroendocrine pathways.  Two experiments were conducted using neurotransmitter receptor agonists and antagonists to identify neural pathways in the brain which mediate LH suppression by oestradiol and by steroid-independent mechanisms, and to test if the thyroid gland is required for activation of these pathways during the non-breeding season. It was concluded from the lack of plasma LH responses to dopaminergic and opioidergic agonists and antagonists in ovariectomized and ovariectomized, thyroidectomized hinds (n=5) that neural pathways involving dopamine-D&#8322;receptors do not mediate oestradiol-induced seasonal suppression of plasma LH concentrations, and neither dopaminergic or opioid neural pathways mediate non-steroidal suppression of plasma LH concentrations. However preliminary evidence was obtained for a stimulatory role of serotonergic neural pathways in controlling LH secretion. Another experiment was conducted to identify when the steroid-independent mechanisms which suppress LH concentrations during the non-breeding season are responsive to thyroid hormones. T&#8324;treatment at the beginning of or during the non breeding season was effective in bringing about suppression of plasma LH concentration in thyroidectomized, ovariectomized hinds (n=5 per group), but this action of thyroid hormones did not occur during the breeding season. These results show that the steroid-independent mechanisms which contribute to seasonal suppression of plasma gonadotrophin concentrations require thyroid hormones to be present only from around the time of the end of the breeding season for their normal expression, and they remain responsive to thyroid hormones after this period. Lastly, the feasibility of achieving out-of-season breeding using thyroidectomized hinds (n=9) was evaluated by comparing oestrous behaviour, ovulation and pregnancy rates to those of euthyroid control hinds (n=7) following synchronization of oestrous cycles. There was a non-significant trend for a greater occurrence of oestrous behaviour and ovulation in thyroidectomized hinds compared with euthyroid controls during the non-breeding season, but the pregnancy rate following out-of season mating with a thyroidectomized stag was low, suggesting that a side effect of thyroidectomy may be impaired fertility. Six out-of-season pregnancies were obtained from eight matings, however because three of these pregnancies occurred in euthyroid control hinds no improvement in out-of-season reproductive performance could be attributed to thyroidectomy. It is likely that if the actions of the thyroid glands are to be exploited as a tool for achieving out-of-season breeding in this species, techniques will have to be developed for specifically blocking or overcoming the effects of thyroid hormones on the reproductive neuroendocrine centres without causing general hypothyroidism and its associated side-effects.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">red deer</field><field name="subject">Cervus elaphus</field><field name="subject">thyroid</field><field name="subject">seasonal changes</field><field name="subject">reproduction</field><field name="subject">neuroendocrinology</field><field name="subject">anoestrus</field><field name="subject">out-of season breeding</field><field name="subject">070206 - Animal Reproduction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/2139</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors causing feed intake depression in lambs infected by gastrointestinal parasites</field><field name="creator">Dynes, Robyn A.</field><field name="description">A reduction in voluntary feed intake is a major factor in the lost productivity of grazing lambs infected by gastrointestinal parasites yet the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Potential pathways involved in parasite-induced feed intake depression were investigated in lambs with minimal previous exposure to parasites and artificially infected by the small intestinal parasite Trichostrongylus colubriformis. Six in vivo experiments were conducted on lambs housed in individual pens or metabolism crates with similar feeding and experimental procedures.  In Experiment 1 (Chapter 4) the effect of T. colubriformis infection on short term feed intake in lambs and of some pharmacological agents on feed intake depression were investigated. Prior to and for the duration of infection, lambs were fed once per day and feed intake recorded at regular intervals over the day (8 h). Following the onset of feed intake depression in the infected group (9 weeks after commencing dosing), all animals were treated with an analgesic (codeine phosphate per os), an anti-inflammatory agent (indomethacin per os), a CCK antagonist (L364-718 by subcutaneous injection) or saline (control) in a replicated Latin square design (n = 8). Although the pattern of feed consumption was similar in infected and non-infected lambs, average daily intake was reduced 32 % and short term intake (recorded at 10 minute intervals for the first hour of feeding, 15 minute intervals for the second hour and hourly for the next 6 hours of feeding) reduced 40 % by infection. This identified the key component by which intake was depressed and enabled the use of a short term intake model and short duration of action compounds to identify the pathways involved in intake depression in this sequence of experiments. None of the pharmacological treatments increased intake in the infected group. These results suggest a reduction in the rate of consumption due to reduced hunger signals, rather than change of meal eating patterns, is the major cause of feed intake depression. Specific conclusions about the pathways investigated using the pharmacological agents could not be obtained.  Experiment 2 (Chapter 5) was designed to investigate the roles of pain and osmolality on feed intake depression. Digesta samples collected prior to and during parasite infection and before and after feeding had similar osmolalities (240-260 mosmol/l) which indicated that feeding or infection had no effect on osmolality of digesta. Following the onset of feed intake depression in infected animals, all animals were treated in a Latin square design (n = 4) with no treatment, saline, local anaesthetic (xylocaine) or analgesic (codeine phosphate) solution 15 minutes before feeding, by slow injection into the duodenum. There was no effect of these treatments on food intake. In the second part of the experiment, hyperosmotic solutions (mannitol and NaCI) markedly depressed short term intake in non-infected animals, suggesting a role for osmoreceptors in intake regulation. However these effects were not blocked by local anaesthetic so the depressed intake may have resulted from generalised malaise rather than from specific osmoreceptor effects.  In Experiment 3 (Chapter 6) the role of peripheral CCK on intake depression was examined by a dose-response study utilising the CCK antagonist, loxiglumide. Intravenous injection of 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg LW of loxiglumide to infected lambs 10-15 minutes before feeding (n = 6) had no effect on feed intake at any of the dose levels. In experiment 4 (Chapter 7) loxiglumide was infused intravenously for 10 minutes (30 mg/kg/h) before feeding and for the first 2 h (10 mg/kg/h) after feed was offered to minimise any effect of the rate of clearance of loxiglumide on the lack of feed intake response. As well, the rate of marker disappearance from the abomasum was recorded in both infected and non-infected animals. Continuous infusion of loxiglumide did not attenuate parasite induced intake depression nor did it have any effect on abomasal emptying. Abomasal volume was reduced by infection (66.3 vs 162 ml) as was the fractional outflow rate (2.2 vs 2.8 ml/min) but these differences were accounted for by the lower level of feed intake in the infected animals.  In Experiment 5 (Chapter 8) brotizolam, a benzodiazepine appetite stimulant, thought to act on the hypothalamus, was administered in a dose-response study to infected and non-infected animals (n = 4) immediately prior to feeding or following termination of the first meal (45 minutes after feeding) and the feed intake response recorded. Brotizolam elevated both the short term (0-0.75 h), daily (22 h) intake and all time intervals in the first 5 h after feeding in infected and non-infected animals when administered after the first meal but when administered prior to feeding elevated intake only over the first 6 h of feeding. In both cases the magnitude of the response was greater in infected animals than in non-infected animals. Brotizolam appeared to increase the rate of eating without having a major impact on meal eating patterns when administered before feeding. Where administration was after the first meal, the effect was due to an "extra" meal being consumed. These findings showed that infected animals can respond to central stimulators of intake although the mechanism of the response is not known.  Opioids were implicated in intake depression as the rate of intake rather than meal patterns appeared to be the major parameter depressed under parasitism. This was examined in experiment 6 (Chapter 9) where animals (n = 6) were fasted for 26 h or not fasted, then treated with saline (control), brotizolam (intake stimulant) or naloxone (opioid antagonist) immediately prior to feeding. Fasting stimulated feed intake in the short term (100 % increase in 75 min) and over the day (12 % increase) in both infected and non-infected animals. Following fasting, infected animals ate a similar amount of feed to the non-infected, fasted animals and more than the non-infected, non-fasted animals. The signals resulting from a one day fast were sufficient in the short term to override parasite induced mechanisms causing feed intake depression. Naloxone suppressed the intake stimulatory effects of a 26 h fast in both infected and non-infected animals, which supports a role for endogenous opioids as hunger signals. Where animals were not fasted, naloxone reduced intake only in the non-infected animals which suggested endogenous opioid levels may be lower in infected animals than in non-infected animals.  In the final experiment (Experiment 7, Chapter 10) the role of central hunger and satiety mechanism were investigated. Infected and non-infected animals (n = 6) were treated with naloxone or saline by intravenous injection, or saline and met-enkephalinamide (an opioid analogue) by intracerebral infusion, or naloxone and the opioid analogue simultaneously to investigate the role of central opioids in feed intake depression. To determine the role of CCK induced satiety signals on feed intake at a central level, loxiglumide and CCK were infused separately and in combination for 30 minutes prior to feeding and for the first 60 minutes of feed on offer, into a lateral cerebral ventricle of the brain of infected and control animals (n = 6).  The opioid analogue tended to increase intake in infected animals but the effect was not significant probably because the dose used was too low to elicit a response in sheep. Naloxone depressed intake only in the infected animals, which conflicted with the results of Experiment 4. As a consequence these results were inconclusive because of the single low dose of opioid analogue used and the conflicting naloxone responses.  CCK alone depressed intake by 39-52 % only in infected animals and this effect of the 90 minute infusion was evident over the 8 h short term recording period. Loxiglumide attenuated the feed intake depressive effects of CCK in the infected animals to the extent that intake was elevated above control levels. Loxiglumide alone was an intake stimulant in both infected and non-infected animals. Intake was increased over the entire 8 h but mostly in the second hour when intake was increased by 188 % in infected animals and by 16 % in the non-infected animals and resulted in almost continuous eating. These results showed loxiglumide will temporarily block the effect of parasite infection on feed intake in sheep when administered centrally and the fact that it blocked the effects of exogenous CCK on intake indicated that the effect is mediated via CCK receptors.  In conclusion GIT parasite infection reduced both short term and daily feed intake apparently by a change in rate of intake rather than any alteration in meal patterns. It was further suggested that anyone of a number of potential peripheral pathways, including changes to osmolality, gut emptying, pain and inflammation of the gut, alone is not involved in anorexia in sofar as the compounds used could block these factors and the results support the idea that intake depression is mediated via a central mechanism. Intake in infected animals responded to a much greater extent when fasting, i.c.v. loxiglumide or brotizolam were employed. Feed intake thus appears to be regulated through the same mechanisms in infected and non-infected animals. The results from compounds affecting the central mechanism suggest central CCK receptors are important in parasite induced anorexia, possibly by changing the onset of satiety or by interacting with endogenous opioids to reduce the rate of feed intake. Secondly reduced endogenous opioids may be causing the reduction in the rate of feed consumption alone or as a result of other interactions. It was concluded that intake in parasitised animals could be increased to that of control animals by employing procedures and compounds thought to act on the hypothalamus.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">feed intake</field><field name="subject">gastrointestinal parasites</field><field name="subject">Trichostrongylus colubriformis</field><field name="subject">CCK antagonists</field><field name="subject">L364-718</field><field name="subject">loxiglumide</field><field name="subject">fasting</field><field name="subject">opioids</field><field name="subject">naloxone</field><field name="subject">pain</field><field name="subject">osmolality</field><field name="subject">inflammation</field><field name="subject">070205 - Animal Protection (Pests and Pathogens)</field><field name="subject">070204 - Animal Nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/2174</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living.

In all conditions relative performance between individuals was consistent (r = 0.84-0.99) and the grinding performance test differentiated well between individuals. External work had lower overall variation (1.6-3.9%) than peak power (1.3-5.4%), especially when grinding against greater loads. Grinding performance was less consistent in heeled conditions (4.6-6.9%) than on the flat, but grinding direction did not affect reliability. Performance changes over 4% could be interpreted with confidence. Peak torque occurred at 95&#176; (77 N m) and 35&#176; (69 N m) for forward and backward grinding respectively (0&#176; = grinding crank vertically up). Torque of &gt;50 N m was maintained through 72% of the cycle during forward grinding but only 47% for backward grinding. Differences were attributed to a greater spread of active muscles throughout the cycle for forward grinding, and contrasting movements contributing most to torque &#8211; upper body push for forward grinding and pull for backward grinding. Variant characteristics of the two grinding directions provide some explanation for the significant advantage (+8.0%, p&lt;0.001) when grinding in pairs with an anterior-posterior heel compared to a medio-lateral heel. Movement characteristics did not readily explain why an anterior-posterior heel may be more advantageous under higher grinding loads (1.0%, p = 0.254), while medio-lateral heel is better at lower loads (2.0%, p = 0.017). Muscular performance of sailors, examined using an instrumented Smith machine, showed force and 1RM strength were greater in the bench press by ~17%. Velocity and power output were greater for the bench pull across the range of loads with the difference increasing exponentially as load increased to over 400% higher at 1RM load. Bench press 1RM and maximum force capability demonstrated strongest correlations with forward grinding performance (r = 0.88-0.99 and 0.87-0.99 respectively) with the relationship increasing with grinding load. There was a strong relationship for backward grinding with bench pull maximum power (r = 0.85-0.98) in addition to 1RM (r = 0.90-0.95) and maximum force (r = 0.87-0.95). Backward grinding performance showed greater improvements in the power-focussed training group than the control group for moderate (+1.8%) and heavy load (+6.0%) grinding in the intervention study. Changes in maximum power output and power at 1RM had large correlations (r = 0.56-0.61) with changes in both moderate and heavy load grinding performance. Time to peak force explained 70% of the change in heavy load grinding performance. Performance benefits from the training intervention were not entirely clear, but the likelihood of a detrimental effect was low (&lt;5%), therefore further training intervention was recommended.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Yachting</field><field name="subject">Movement analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/924</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Airway smooth muscle dynamics</field><field name="creator">IJpma, Gijs</field><field name="description">The current study aims to investigate the relative contributions of each of the processes that govern airway smooth muscle mechanical behaviour. Studies have shown that breathing dynamics have a substantial effect on airway constriction in healthy and diseased subjects, yet little is known about the dynamic response of the main instigator of airway constriction, Airway Smooth Muscle (ASM). In this work several models are developed to further the understanding of ASM dynamics, particularly the roles and interactions of the three dominant processes in the muscle: contractile dynamics, length adaptation and passive dynamics. Three individual models have been developed, each describing a distinct process or structure within the muscle. The first is a contractile model which describes the contractile process and the influence of external excitation on contractile behaviour. The second model incorporates the contractile model to describe length adaptation, which includes the reorganisation and polymerisation of contractile elements in response to length changes. The third model describes the passive behaviour of the muscle, which entails the mechanical behaviour of all non-contractile components and processes. As little data on the passive dynamics of the muscle was available in the literature, a number of experiments were conducted to investigate relaxed ASM dynamics. The experimental data and mathematical modelling showed that passive dynamics plays not only a dominant role in relaxed ASM, but contributes considerably to the dynamics of contracted muscle as well. A novel theory of sequential multiplication in passive ASM is proposed and implemented in a mathematical model. Experiments and literature validated the model simulations. Further integration of the models and improved force control modelling of length adaptation is proposed for future study. It is likely that the coupling of the models presented here with models describing other airway wall components will provide a more complete picture of airway dynamics, which will be invaluable for understanding respiratory disease.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Airway smooth muscle</field><field name="subject">Mathematical modelling</field><field name="subject">Biomedical engineering</field><field name="subject">Power law relaxation</field><field name="subject">Tissue rheology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/941</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The fashionable Muslim</field><field name="creator">Gopi, Dallas Raj</field><field name="description">The Fashionable Muslim is a story about pragmatism, but not obviously so.

Contemporary representations of embroidery suggest that new and innovative interpretations exist. Through investigation and experimentation with products, textiles and techniques, the embroidered artefacts that I have crafted are intended to disrupt the conventional perceptions of embroidery by alluding to conceptual associations of tradition and nostalgia. The aim of this project is to promote embroidery as a diverse medium; its use as a means of narrative, a valued skill that spans both art and craft disciplines, and to lift the status of craft by encouraging discourse of craft practice within an academic environment.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Embroidery</field><field name="subject">Craft</field><field name="subject">Art and craft</field><field name="subject">Heuristics</field><field name="subject">Creative practice</field><field name="subject">Textile art</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/947</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Systematic studies on Thysanotus R.Br. (Asparagales: Laxmanniaceae).</field><field name="creator">Sirisena, Udani Megha</field><field name="description">Thysanotus R.Br. (Asparagales; Laxmanniaceae) is a genus native to Australia with c. 50 species distributed chiefly in Australia. To date, Thysanotus lacks proper and detailed systematic studies based on molecular and/or non-molecular data. Therefore, carrying out a detailed systematic study using molecular and/or non-molecular data seemed important. Furthermore, generic placement of Murchisonia Brittan has always been controversial and this placement required testing under a phylogenetic framework. The generic relationships within Laxmanniaceae/Lomandraceae are considered uncertain; therefore, a phylogenetic analysis using molecular and morphological data is necessary to properly understand the generic relationships of Laxmanniaceae. Detailed studies on stem anatomy and morphology were carried out in order to understand the systematic significance and phylogenetic signal of these characters. The cp DNA (trnL intron and trnL&#8211;F intergenic spacer) and nuclear ITS2 gene regions were amplified and the results compared and combined with a morphological analysis. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out using Arthropodium R.Br and Eustrephus R.Br as outgroup taxa. There was sufficient variation in general morphology, seed micromorphology and stem anatomy and were potentially useful in understanding phylogenetic relationships of Thysanotus. A number of synapomorphies based on general morphology and stem anatomy such as absence of pendent flowers and absence of irregular shaped epidermal cells were recognised. The molecular data and the combined data yielded highly resolved consensus trees and enabled us to recognise three main lineages within the genus, each representing life history adaptations. Murchisonia was consistently nested within Thysanotus in all analyses showing a need for the return of both species to Thysanotus. Insights to intraspecific variation were also discernable from morphological, molecular and the combined analyses in species such as T. patersonii and T. juncifolius. Two new Thysanotus species, T. unicupensis and T. racemoides are also described. Our data strongly support the current circumscription of Laxmanniaceae, but suggest that there are three main lineages within the family, rather than the two previously recognised subfamilies.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">systematics; phylogeny; thysanotus; molecular data; morphology; stem anatomy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59350</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Totara Valley micro-hydro development : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Renewable Energy Engineering, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, David Ronald</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the design, construction and operation of a distributed generation system based on micro-hydro technology. The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expectations, emerging issues and change for Chinese international students in a New Zealand university : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Second Language Teaching at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Skyrme, Gillian Ray</field><field name="description">This study uses a sociocultural framework to trace the experiences of 24 Chinese international undergraduate students studying business and information sciences in a New Zealand university, using community of practice perspectives recognising the university as a site of complex discourses requiring negotiation of new identities and practices. The students&#8217; expectations, the issues that emerged and the processes of change they went through to meet their goals were investigated from retrospective and longitudinal viewpoints, using semi-structured interviews supported by schematic representations developed by the researcher and photographic representations compiled by participants were. The findings suggest that preparation before departure focused largely on expected English demands, rather than wider matters of academic culture, and this was only partially rectified during prior study in New Zealand. Students thus entered the university unfamiliar with its specific discourses and found conditions for resolving difficulties more limited than previously experienced. The anonymity and extreme time pressure pertaining in large first-year classes led to bewilderment about requirements, threats to the sense of identity as competent students which they had arrived with, and often, failure of courses. Nevertheless, the investment, personal and monetary, which this journey represented provided the incentive to persevere. Most students were resourceful in negotiating a fit between their learning preferences and the affordances of the university, resulting in very different journeys for each of them. Measures adopted included those sanctioned by the university, such as developing skills to meet the demands of academic literacies, and others less valued, such as extreme dependence on teacher consultation. Success was gained through personal agency which proved more important than the university goal of student autonomy. Beyond the academic arena, other activities such as part-time jobs were significant in contributing to a sense of identity as competent and educated adults, and to new viewpoints which contrasted with original cultural norms. They continued to identify as Chinese, but in a &#8220;third space&#8221; owing something to New Zealand influences. The study concludes that entry criteria should include a component of university preparation. It also recommends measures by which the university might enhance the experiences of such students.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese international students</field><field name="subject">university</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">social</field><field name="subject">cultural</field><field name="subject">sociocultural</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330199 Education studies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/793</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Tu'i Kanokupolu Matai establishment and why would Tu'i Tonga Fuanunuiava have vied to become one? : a genealogical analysis of post 1550 AD new political hegemony in Tonga</field><field name="creator">'Ilaiu, Siaosi L.</field><field name="description">This work examines some issues relating to specific social, political and ideological developments that have shaped the pre-contact history of Tonga especially the puzzling ideas that revolve around the co-existence of the three kingly lines that survived into the era of written record. There are competing versions of how each dynasty came about and what kinds of contribution they accomplished. I endeavour to go further than what current research has brought to light so far. In fact, current research on Tongan history is stagnant due to some great lack in research methodology whereby easy problems cannot be logically deciphered. I believe this is because present disciplinary guidelines limit the scope for attaining a deep understanding of things not to mention the failure of comparative method (comparing chronologies in neighbouring islands) to underpin the historical realities on offer. One of my main concerns in this study rests on how well the contact period reflects the reality of what we may refer to as Tongan tradition or what is really traditional about Tongan ways of life prior to the seventeenth century. This thesis is designed to use Tongan genealogy as a guide in attempting to make sense of what the European records can offer to our understanding of post-contact Tonga. Historical documentation in this context refers simply to post-contact recording of events, whereas traditional history, ordered by genealogy, gives us access to a more distant past. This work argues further that genealogy unravels an ever-presence of conflicting tendencies that existed even in times where Tongan society was perceived to enjoy long-term peace. This thesis is aimed at a complete rethinking of political transformations in ancient Tongan polity and how such transformations introduced new patterns of social, political and ideological realities that current scholars have not yet recognised. I also show how genealogy is useful in determining the course of Tongan political history, especially the major changes that took place a few centuries before contact with Europe came about in the early 17th century AD. In Chapter one, I introduce an alternative theory about the political history of Tonga since the inception of the TK dynasty1. I also delineate how genealogy reflects major changes in all aspects of life in both pre- contact and post-contact Tonga. In the light of this better understanding of Tongan political history I employ Antonio Gramci&#8217;s dialectic to harness and clarify matters relating to social processes in the past that have remained unexplained up to now. I discuss here the hegemony of the Tu&#8217;i Tonga dynasty i.e. how it was achieved and maintained for over a thousand years from 450 AD until around 1500 AD when there was an unsuccessful counter-hegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua line. In 1550 shortly after the Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua failure every commentator of Tongan society has overlooked another counter hegemony by the third dynasty. The Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu hegemony will be critically discussed with reference to a further counterhegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Tonga by which strategy the old dynasty managed to survive a bit longer. Chapter 2 then, offers a critique of old notions about Tongan society in works written mostly by the socalled Polynesianist revisionists who have constantly revisited Tongan history for the past two decades. I also show why Tongan traditionalists and scholars alike could not understand what had been happening in Tonga&#8217;s past. This work focuses on the creation of the third dynasty in Tonga around 1550 AD. There are a number of issues relating to this event that have not been discussed by any commentator of Tongan society so far. These include the indirect but significant importation of a quasi-Samoan matai system that eventually formed the basis of Tongan polity encountered by European explorers starting from Souten and Le Maire in 1616 during the reign of the third Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu (Mataeletu&#8217;apiko), when the matai system was locally practised in the narrow confines of Hihifo2. It had gained momentum at the time of Captain Cook&#8217;s last visit in 1777. The system grew stronger and spread to all corners of the Tongan archipelago within the duration of only two centuries. It is the growth of this system that this study determines to underpin, as it will provide a more lucid explanation for a number of important puzzles that still confuse contemporary historians. First, the reason why and how the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu came into existence, the odd nature of Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political practices, and the secrets behind the mass production of titles as family and extended family gifts plus how these gifts determined the outcome of social, political, and religious activities that all three dynasties engaged in, in their tensely unavoidable coexistence especially in the eighteenth century. Chapter 3 - offers a general discussion of Ama&#8217;s possible schemes and plots. I argue in this part that Ama was determined to recapture and rule Safata. In Samoa I identify a connection between a political struggle (civil war) that took place in Upolu around 1500 &#8211; 1520 AD with the creation of the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu in Tonga about 1550 AD. This war is discussed here for two reasons. First, it was an attempt by Samoan high chiefs to create a centralised in Upolu state to be headed by a Samoan monarch for the first time in their history. Second, the end result of this war affected Tonga more than Samoa since the vanquished Ama fled from his district Safata to Tonga. This chapter concentrates on discussing the major players in the said war. Chapter 4 &#8211; This part discusses Samoan politics at the time of Ama&#8217;s exile. I also unfold here the structure of Samoan polity by discussing the matai system and how it generates political, social and religious responsibilities among Samoan lives in general. This chapter discusses significant principles of Samoan social and political organisation such as matai (title system), tafa&#8217;i (royal protector), faleupolu (political advisors), &#8216;aiga (extended family), sa (family &#8211; royal lines), ali&#8217;i-pa&#8217;ia (sacred chief/district monarch), ali&#8217;i (high chief), tulafale-ali&#8217;i (minor chief), and tulafale (chief&#8217;s attendant). These organisations will be compared with the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political system so that the resemblance is not confused with the Tu&#8217;i Tonga and Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua systems. Chapter 5 - discusses with critical analyses the real characters of the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political establishment. Such discussion includes TK status, the conception of &#8216;ulutolu (chief&#8217;s protector), hingoa &#8211; fakanofo (title system), falekanokupolu (political advisors), kainga (extended family), ha&#8217;a (titled chiefs related to an original royal line), &#8216;eiki lahi (paramount chief), eiki (high chief), &#8216;eiki si&#8217;i (minor chief), matapule (chief&#8217;s attendant). I argue in this part, that the TK political organisation is essentially structured in Samoan fashion both in theory and in practice and I will show the basic difference between this system and the quintessential Tu&#8217;i Tonga organisational principles described in the next chapter. Chapter 6 &#8211; This chapter depicts the basic structure of the Tu&#8217;i Tonga political organisation and how it countered the powerful hegemony of the TK expansion in the 17th and 18th centuries when there was an internal struggle for political supremacy among the three ruling dynasties. I discuss here counter hegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Tonga, which resulted in the creation of several new statuses such as the Tu&#8217;i Tonga fefine (female Tu&#8217;i Tonga), tamaha (sacred being &#8211; female), falefisi (sacred house of Fiji). This chapter also highlights the collision between the old political system and the new and also shows how the new system paved its way to an undisputed status in the mid 19th century after the last conflict of 1852. I discuss the new Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu ha&#8217;a system and the kind of impact it propagated in the dominions of Tu&#8217;i Tonga and Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua. Chapter 7 &#8211; My main concern in this chapter rests on a case where a highborn female Tupou moheofo successfully usurped the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu title and became the first female titleholder in this dynasty. She was very ambitious and pried into politics on a number of occasions when she made attempts to revolutionise the norm of Tongan tradition such as her well known move to dethrone her husband Tu&#8217;i Tonga Pau in favour of their son Fuanunuiava and also her desperate instigation to abolish the office of the TK in the 1770s. Chapter 8 &#8211; Discusses how TT Fuanunuiava aspired to obtain political authority and his strange ambition to be named Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu after the death of TK Mumui in 1798. Why should a Tu&#8217;i Tonga vie to be named TK will be discussed here in great detail.

This cyclic pattern may represent a natural frequency at varying timescales in the growth dynamics of stratovolcanoes, but is often difficult to identify because of long cycle-timescales, coupled with incomplete stratigraphic records. The volcaniclastic ring-plain succession surrounding the 2 518 m Mt. Taranaki, New Zealand, comprises a wide variety of distinctive volcanic mass-flow lithofacies with sedimentary and lithology characteristics that can be related to recurring volcanic cycles over &gt;190 ka. Debrisflow and monolithologic hyperconcentrated-flow deposits record edifice growth phases while polylithologic debris-avalanche and associated cohesive debris-flow units were emplaced by collapse. Major edifice failures at Mt. Taranaki occurred on-average every 10 ka, with five events recognised over the last 30 ka, a time interval for which stratigraphic records are more complete. The unstable nature of Mt. Taranaki mainly results from its weak internal composite structure including abundant saturated pyroclastic deposits and breccia layers, along with its growth on a weakly indurated and tectonically fractured basement of Tertiary mudstones and sandstones. As the edifice repeatedly grew beyond a critical stable height or profile, large-scale collapses were triggered by intrusions preceding magmatic activity, major eruptions, or significant regional tectonic fault movements. Clasts within debris-avalanche deposits were used as a series of windows into the composition of previous successive proto-Mt Taranaki edifices in order to examine magmatic controls on their failure. The diversity of lithologies and their geochemical characteristics are similar throughout the history of the volcano, with the oldest sample suites displaying a slightly broader range of compositions including more primitive rock types. The evolution to a narrower range and higher-silica compositions was accompanied by an increase in K2O. This shows that later melts progressively interacted with underplated amphibolitic material at the base of the crust. These gradual changes imply a long-term stability of the magmatic system. The preservation of similar internal conditions during the volcano&#8217;s evolution, hence suggests that external processes were the main driving force behind its cyclic growth and collapse behaviour and resulting sedimentation pattern.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vulcanology</field><field name="subject">Mount Taranaki</field><field name="subject">Mount Egmont</field><field name="subject">volcanoes</field><field name="subject">stratigraphic geology</field><field name="subject">geochemistry</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology::260103 Vulcanology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/900</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutritional characteristics of New Zealand export lamb and functional properties of selected beef forequarter muscles : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of technology in Bioprocess Engineering at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Jansen, Eion</field><field name="description">Richmond Ltd. has recently undergone a change in strategy, away from the traditional commodity based meat industry, towards the modern food business. To do this, opportunities to add value to their current product range must be identified. This involves the conversion of traditionally low value commodity based products into products that demand a premium. An example of this is converting muscles that are currently used for grinding meat into a further processed convenience food (i.e. ready meals). Another method is to add further value to premium products by making them more appealing to consumers (i.e. nutritional information on labels). This work details investigations into the functional properties of selected beef forequarter muscles (low value commodity products) and the nutritional properties of selected export lamb products (premium products). The functional properties of a number of beef forequarter muscles were measured to identify which had the best potential for further processing applications with respect to ready meals. The functional properties of tenderness, cook loss and shrinkage were measured for the Latissimus Dorsi, Pectorialis Profundus (Point End Brisket), Infraspinatus (Cross Cut Blade), Triceps Brachi Longhead (Main muscle in Bolar Shoulder Clod), Supraspinatus (Chuck Tender), Serratus Ventralis and Triceps Brachi Medialhead (Muscle in Bolar Shoulder Clod. From the tests conducted the Infraspinatus and the Triceps Brachi Longhead have been identified as having the best functional properties with respect to further processing for ready meal applications. As well as conducting tests to identify the forequarter muscles with the best potential for further processing applications, investigations were carried out to identify cooking regimes that would optimise the functional properties. This work confirmed that there are three major chemical reactions, which determine the resultant functional properties of cooked meat. They are the denaturation and aggregation of the myofibrillar proteins and the denaturation and solubilisation of connective tissue (collagen). At around 50&#176;C myosin (45% to 50% of the myofibrillar proteins) denatures, which results in a substantial increase in cook loss and reduction in water holding capacity. At around 60&#176;C collagen (main connective tissue protein) denatures, which results in a substantial increase in tenderness and increase in cook loss. This is because as the collagen denatures it loses it mechanical strength (increase in tenderness) and can no longer support its own structure, and causes it to contract. This contraction causes fluid within the meat and cook loss caused by the denaturation of myosin to be expelled from the meat by compressive forces (squeezed out). At around 70&#176;C actomyosin (22% of the myofibrillar proteins) denatures. This results in a substantial increase in the cook loss and firming of the meat. The increase in cook loss or decrease in water holding capacity that occurs with myofibrillar protein denaturation is due to the fact that when these proteins denature and aggregate their ability to bind water is greatly reduced. From the results of the cooking regime trials it is recommended that for functional property considerations that during the cooking of further processed meat products (i.e. ready meal applications) a meat temperature of 62&#176;C should be aimed for, for the slowest heating region during cooking (usually the centre). This is because it has been identified that a cooking temperature of 65&#176;C should not be exceeded otherwise detrimental effects can occur to the functional properties of the cooked meat. For health concerns a 7D bacterial death reduction has to be achieved. This means that for a cooking temperature of 62&#176;C the meat has to be held at this temperature for at least 5 minutes. Therefore the total cooking time would be the time needed to heat all the meat to 62&#176;C plus 5 minutes to ensure a safe product. The heating or cooking system employed should also ensure that a minimal amount of the meat is heated above 65&#176;C. This can be easily achieved by minimising the external cooking temperature, but long cooking times will result. An industrial cooking process will be a compromise between the cost associated with longer residence time and product functionality. As mentioned earlier another way to add value is to supply nutritional information for selected cuts. Consequentially one of the objectives of this project was to provide some nutritional information for selected meat cuts. Though the primary objective of this part of the project was to develop a method for producing the needed information, so that Richmond N.Z. Ltd. can develop further information on an as needs basis. The nutritional characteristics of a number of export lamb cuts from the saddle region has also been investigated and a method devised to allow further characterisation of other cuts. The method involves breaking down a standard cut into its constituent components (e.g. Frenched rack consists of loin eye, fat cap, intercostals and fatty tissue). The constituent components are tested for their nutritional properties. The frenched rack nutritional properties are calculated from the nutritional properties of the constituents components and the yield data (percentage of each constituent component within a frenched rack) for frenched racks. This method allowed the identification of the main sources of variation for nutritional characteristics. These differences were found to be caused by the lean to fat ratio, not nutritional differences in lean tissue from the same region of lamb (i.e. loin eye and tenderloin very similar nutritionally). The difference in lean to fat ration also accounts for the variation between grades (i.e. PX grade lamb cuts have a higher fat content than YX grade lamb cuts due to PX grade cuts having a higher percentage fat tissue in their cuts). The cuts characterised were the shortloin section (whole section or chop), rack section (whole section or chop), 75mm racks frenched 25mm, boneless loin and tenderloin for both PX and YX grade lamb. The method will be applicable to other regions of lamb (i.e. hindquarter and forequarter) for which nutritional information already exists, but for which yielding data will have to be collected. The method would also be applicable to other species such as beef and venison, but both nutritional data for constituent components and yielding data would have to be collected.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Infraspinatus</field><field name="subject">Triceps Brachi Longhead</field><field name="subject">ready meals</field><field name="subject">cooked meat</field><field name="subject">protein denaturation</field><field name="subject">nutritional properties</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290103 Food processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/895</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anthelmintic treatment and digestive organ morphology of captive-reared kaki (Himantopus novaezelandiae) released to the wild : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Robertson, Louise Mary</field><field name="description">The continued existence of New Zealand&#8217;s critically endangered and endemic black stilt or kak&#239; (Himantopus novaezelandiae) relies on an intensive captive management programme. While this is successful at rearing large numbers of birds for release to the wild, poor survivability of these birds is limiting significant increases in the wild population. Predation and starvation are suspected to be the most common causes of death in released birds, but underlying contributing factors to these mortalities have not been fully evaluated. This research investigates the possible contribution of gastrointestinal (GI) helminth burdens and suboptimal digestive organ development to the high mortality rates of released kak&#239;. Emphasis is placed on evaluating the methods used to assess the importance of these factors and to make informed recommendations for future management. The efficacy of the anthelmintic regime used for kak&#239; was assessed by dosing half of the 80 captive birds with praziquantel (PZQ) prior to release in 2007. Faecal samples were collected before and after anthelmintic treatment, and before and after release to the wild. Post mortem worm counts were conducted on 11 birds that died following release and historical worm count records dating back to 1997 were accessed. The main findings were: PZQ had high efficacy against trematodes; treatment did not prevent re-infection; birds were exposed to helminths at release site; and there was no advantage of treatment for survival. Overall, the results suggest that anthelmintic treatment is an unnecessary cost. Consequently, recommendations were made to cease anthelmintic treatment or reduce its intensity, continue health screening, and incorporate annual efficacy testing to monitor the emergence of anthelmintic resistance. The reliability of faecal screening for GI helminths was evaluated. Faecal egg counts (FECs) were found to be poor indicators of worm burden. The two modified sedimentation methods used to detect trematodes provided relatively low egg recovery rates. Trematode egg shedding varied between days but not by hour of the day or temperature. The collection and analysis of pooled faecal samples proved to be more cost and time-effective than samples from individual birds and the larger masses collected resulted in greater sensitivity. In conclusion, faecal analysis of pooled samples is a useful qualitative indicator of helminth presence or absence but is quantitatively unreliable. In order to assess the importance of digestive organ development to captive-reared and released kak?, the digestive organs of healthy and emaciated captive, released and wild Himantopus sp. were compared. Captive and released kak? had generally smaller digestive organs than wild birds, released birds did not increase digestive organ size to match the high fibre wild diet, and emaciated birds did not have atrophied organs. However, the greatest mortality rates occur soon after release, while the birds were still being supplementary fed. These results suggest that reduced digestive efficiency is probably not contributing significantly to mortality rates and the direct impacts of the translocation are probably greater risk factors. The continued provision of supplementary food to released birds and an increased focus on habitat enhancement and predator control at release sites were recommended. The reliability of comparing fresh and formalin fixed Himantopus sp. gut specimens was evaluated. Significant differences in fresh and formalin fixed organ dry masses and variation in preserved organ lengths indicate that this variation should be considered in future studies. In conclusion, current management practices appear to be successful in ensuring that GI helminths and reduced digestive efficiency do not significantly lower the survivorship of captive-reared and released kak&#239;. There is a need for further research into developing a more direct physiological assessment of the impacts of GI helminths and gut morphology as well as considering the role that starvation may have on poor survivability.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">black stilt</field><field name="subject">captive management</field><field name="subject">endangered species</field><field name="subject">gastrointestinal helminth</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300805 Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality assessment and ethnicity : a New Zealand study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand.

To date there has only been two published studies that have used New Zealand relevant ethnic groups when analysing whether personality measures used in pre-employment settings exhibit different mean scores. The present thesis performed a systematic evaluation on the impact of ethnicity on personality traits. The study examined the impact of ethnicity on NZ Army Officer applicant personality assessment scores measured by the EPQ-R and GPP-I. Four ethnic groups (NZ Europeans, M&#226;ori, Pasifika, and Asian) were analysed for mean trait score differences among ethnic groups, the stability of these differences across different personality inventories and models, the variance of personality traits, the impact of ethnicity on age and gender relationships with personality traits, and how these differences were related to employment selection outcomes. The analyses revealed that ethnicity did have some impact on mean personality assessment scores used in the study. However, these were mostly small differences among ethnic groups. In addition, most of these differences found on the EPQ-R and the GPP-I were not consistent across inventories and models. There were no significant variance differences found on personality traits among ethnic groups. While initial analysis suggested that ethnicity did not influence the relationship between age and gender on personality assessment, further examination suggested that the relationship between gender and personality was impacted on by ethnicity. There were reassuring results found for New Zealand psychologists and HR specialists, as only two of the twelve traits analysed showed moderate differences on traits that were related to selection outcomes. However, for the NZ Army OSB selection process the findings in the present study indicate that the Lie scale on the EPQ-R and the Vigor trait on the GPP-I may need to be interpreted with caution for Asian and Pasifika groups. These results are discussed in terms of implications for personality theory, measurement, and the direction of future research.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personality assessment</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised</field><field name="subject">EPQ-R</field><field name="subject">Gordon Personal Profile - Inventory</field><field name="subject">GPP-I</field><field name="subject">ethnic status</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1188</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reflecting diversity or selecting viewpoints : an analysis of the GM debate in New Zealand's media 1998-2002 : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of PhD in Communication at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ashwell, Douglas James</field><field name="description">The advent of genetically modified (GM) food in New Zealand in 1998 saw the beginning of a highly politicised debate about GM use in the country. The concern over GM and the political situation after the 1999 general election saw the Government establish a Royal Commission of Inquiry on Genetic Modification in May, 2000. The Royal Commission and strong public opposition to GM, evident in large public protests and other actions, made the issue highly newsworthy. The aim of this study was to explore how newspapers reported the GM debate, in particular, examining whether the reportage facilitated greater public debate and awareness about GM through journalists adhering to the ideals of the theory of social responsibility and enacting their watchdog role as encapsulated in the Fourth Estate tradition of the media. To achieve these aims the overall tone of the reportage and also which news source types and themes were most frequently reported were examined. In addition, the relationship and perceptions of scientists and journalists involved in the reporting were explored to examine how these relationships may have influenced the reportage. Content analysis showed the reportage had a pro-GM bias with policy-makers, scientists and industry spokespeople the most frequently cited news sources. The themes of Science, Economics and Politics dominated the reportage. Other source types and themes were less represented, especially themes dealing with ethical and environmental arguments. This lack of representation occurred despite the Royal Commission offering a space for all interested parties to speak. The interviews illustrated that scientists believed the quality of newspaper coverage of GM lacked depth and that important issues were unreported. Journalists found the issue complex to report and said they took care not to oversimplify the science and issues surrounding GM. The relationship between scientists and journalists indicated particular tensions existing between the two groups. The thesis concludes that if robust public debate is to occur within New Zealand regarding GM and other scientific developments, then the media should reflect a greater diversity of opinion by citing other potential news sources offering alternative arguments based on, for example, ethical or environmental grounds.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">journalism viewpoints</field><field name="subject">newspaper report evaluation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::289900 Other Information, Computing and Communication Sciences ::289999 Other information, computing and communication sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Psychological fallout" : the effects of nuclear radiation exposure : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Clinical Psychology at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Jourdain, Rebekah Leigh</field><field name="description">Appendices were not supplied with the digital version of the thesis but are available in the print version.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nuclear test veterans</field><field name="subject">Psychological stress</field><field name="subject">Health anxiety</field><field name="subject">Nuclear radiation exposure</field><field name="subject">Toxic exposure</field><field name="subject">Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380107 Health, clinical and counselling psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1425</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Jesus in New Zealand, 1900-1940 : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in History at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Troughton, Geoffrey M.</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses pervasive ways in which New Zealanders thought about Jesus during the years from approximately 1900 to 1940. In particular, it considers ways that he appeared within discourse, contexts in which he was especially invoked, and ends for which he was employed. It examines Jesus as a religious icon, but also as a reflexive tool for examining the place of religion in New Zealand culture and society. In this sense, it addresses Jesus as a phenomenon of social and cultural history. The thesis draws on a wide range of sources and methodologies, and is organised thematically into chapters that highlight predominant images of Jesus and important contexts that helped shape them. It considers Jesus in the languages of doctrine and devotion, social reform, and for children. It further assesses images of Jesus' masculinity, and representations of him as an 'anti-Church' prophet. The overarching argument is that Jesus constituted an increasingly important focal point in New Zealand religiosity during the period under investigation. Especially within Protestant Christianity, Jesus became a more important discursive focus and acquired new status as a source of authority. This movement reflected wider social and cultural shifts, particularly related to understandings of the nature of society and notions of personality. The increasingly Jesus-centred orientation of Protestant religiosity was fundamentally an attempt to modernise Christianity and extend its reach into the community. In particular, Jesus was invoked as the simple core of Christianity - the attractive essence of 'true religion'. Jesus-centred religiosity provided evidence of a changing social and cultural situation, demonstrating that religious language and ideals could be sensitive indicators of such shifts. The rise of Jesus as a focal point in religion was a response to change that reoriented Protestant Christianity in the process.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Religion in New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Christianity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies::430101 History: New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1421</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maori at work : the shaping of a Maori workforce within the New Zealand state 1935 - 1975 : a thesis submitted in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Social and Cultural Studies, Massey University</field><field name="creator">Nightingale, Richard Beresford</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the dynamics of the shaping of a Maori workforce within the New Zealand nation 1935 - 1975 as a significant outcome of colonial and postcolonial engagements under the introduced capitalist system. It is argued that this was part of a larger process of acculturation and assimilation of Maori. That Maori labour formed a second stage in the incorporation of three indigenous components into the New Zealand domain of a global capitalist market system is accepted conditionally with some modification. Essentially, the first stage (from about 1840) was the need for land for the production of farm commodities; the second stage (from about 1935) was the need for industrial labour power for manufacturing production; and the third stage (from about 1975) was the appropriation of socio-cultural values as instruments to be utilized in social and economic administration by the State. The focus is on the second stage of this process. The central objective is to assess the outcomes of this process on Maori, socially, economically and culturally. Two broad assumptions are interrogated: first, that pools of surplus Maori labour were created as an outcome of the expansion of capitalism on pre-capitalist economies; second, that the incorporation of this surplus labour via migration from about 1935 arose from patterns of capital accumulation that created excess labour demand in urban secondary industries. Successive government policies of racial amalgamation, assimilation, adaptation and integration from 1840 through to the early 1970s, assumed that civilisation and integration were one-way processes. Government policies were predicated on concepts of assimilation and individualisation in a plethora of government initiatives in health, education, housing and social welfare, most of which were unilaterally justified on the grounds of progress and modernisation. These policies, which came to be called 'integration' in the decade of the 1960s, were perceived by government to be for the benefit of Maori and the whole nation, Pakeha and Maori. Arguably, the Hunn Report of 1960/61 marked the high point of this postcolonial ideology. The narrative of the key developments in government policies is inter-woven with an account of race relations and Maori affairs. It is emphasised that these policies were instituted during a period of enormous change&#183; in Maori society and in the configuration of relationships between Maori and Pakeha. The focus is shifted in the last section of the thesis to the response by Maori to government policies. The retreat by Maori from issues of class deprivation to the promotion of issues that centred on loss of land, language and culture is traced. It is noted that the concern with class that marked the rhetoric of many similar global protest movements was remarkably mild in the Maori protest litany. This thesis marks a first attempt to discuss the shaping of a Maori workforce by taking an approach which recognises that the separation between culture and political economy is itself culturally constructed by the dominant actor in the nation-state.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori workforce</field><field name="subject">assimilation</field><field name="subject">Government policies</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::379900 Other Studies In Human Society::379902 Indigenous studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1422</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maloafua : structural adjustment programmes : the case of Samoa : a thesis submitted to Massey University in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, Sociology Programme, School of Social and Cultural Studies, College of Humanities and Social Sciences, Massey University, Albany Campus, Auckland</field><field name="creator">Kerslake, Maria Talaitupu</field><field name="description">Structural adjustment programmes have been promoted globally by international financial institutions as an answer to the financial problems of developing countries like Samoa. This thesis is a study of the history of structural adjustment programmes in the Independent State of Samoa, and focuses specifically on a case study of one particular programme: the restructuring and privatisation of the former Public Works Department (PWD). It seeks to compare the claims made for the reform process by development economists, development consultants and planners, politicians and reform managers, with the experiences of those who were involved in various roles in a particular type of reform: the privatisation of a Government utility. The PWD was chosen by the Samoan Government to kick-start its institutional reform programme. The Department had, over the years, suffered from poor management, corrupt practices, overspending and unaccounted funds which were all revealed in an Auditor General's Report tabled in Parliament in Samoa in 1994. This caused great embarrassment to the Government which had then to respond to these accusations. Government saw the reform of the PWD as a means to respond to public criticism of its lack of oversight, and discontent with the standard of the department's services in public works, institutional construction, repair and maintenance programmes. The study used a case study methodology to interview the people that were involved in the privatisation of the old Public Works Department (PWD). Various people who were, and are still, involved in the process of reforming Government institutions were interviewed. These included the politicians who both advocated and opposed the implementation of the reforms, the consultants who managed them for the Government and international agencies, and employees at all levels of the former Public Works Department. It explored PWD employees' personal and institutional experiences of the period before, during and since the reform of the agency. Despite the propaganda on the benefits that reform programmes have for the countries that implement them, the study has revealed different findings. It identifies and examines some important differences between the claims made by various stakeholders about the reforms, and the experiences of those who were directly involved in various ways. It has shown that people in different positions have different experiences of the same programmes, and that their experiences are significantly influenced by their social location and, specifically, whether they are "insiders" or "outsiders." It concludes by suggesting that since the structural reform project is likely to continue in Samoa for the foreseeable future, it is useful to identify those lessons from the PWD privatisation which might be applied to future projects to mitigate their social and organisational impact.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public Works department, Samoa</field><field name="subject">Privatisation</field><field name="subject">Government administration</field><field name="subject">Financial reform</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360200 Policy and Administration::360202 Public administration</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1423</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on interactions of milk proteins with flavour compounds : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">K&#252;hn, Janina</field><field name="description">Milk proteins are known to bind volatile flavour compounds to varying extents, depending on the nature of the protein and flavour compound. Processing conditions, such as temperature and pH, are also known to have an influence on the interactions between milk proteins and flavour compounds. These interactions cause a great challenge for flavour scientists because they influence the perceived aroma profile of food products significantly, in particular in low-fat food products. The objectives of this research were to develop a headspace solid-phase microextraction (SPME) method followed by gas chromatography with flame ionisation detection (GC-FID) for the investigation of protein-flavour interactions, and to determine binding parameters of the hydrophobic flavour compound, 2-nonanone, to individual milk proteins - namely, &#946;-lactoglobulin (&#946;-lg), &#945;-lactalbumin (&#945;-la), bovine serum albumin (BSA), &#945;s1-casein, and &#946;-casein -, whey protein isolate (WPI), and sodium caseinate. Secondly, it was the aim to compare the binding of the structurally similar flavour compounds - 2-nonanone, 1-nonanal, and trans-2-nonenal &#8211; to WPI in aqueous solution, and to investigate the effect of heat and high pressure treatment, and pH on the extent of protein-flavour binding. The final objective was to investigate the in vivo release of the reversibly bound flavour compound, 2-nonanone, from WPI and sodium caseinate using proton transfer-reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS), and to understand the effect of viscosity on flavour release in vivo. The binding of the model flavour compound 2-nonanone to individual milk proteins, WPI, and sodium caseinate in aqueous solutions was investigated, using headspace SPME followed by GC-FID. The 2-nonanone binding capacities decreased in the order: BSA &gt; &#946;-lg &gt; &#945;-la &gt; &#945;s1-casein &gt; &#946;-casein, and the binding to WPI was stronger than the binding to sodium caseinate. All proteins appeared to have one binding site for 2-nonanone, except for BSA which possessed two classes of binding sites. The influence of heat treatment, high pressure processing and pH of the protein solutions on the binding of 2-nonanone, 1-nonanal, and trans-2-nonenal to WPI was determined. The binding of these compounds to WPI decreased in the order: trans-2-nonenal &gt; 1-nonanal &gt; 2-nonanone. The binding of 2-nonanone appears to involve hydrophobic interactions only, whereas the aldehydes, in particular trans-2-nonenal, also react through covalent binding. Upon both heat and high pressure denaturation, the binding of 2-nonanone to WPI decreased, the binding of 1-nonanal remained unchanged, while the binding of trans-2-nonenal increased. The binding affinity of the flavour compounds and WPI increased with increasing pH, which is likely to result from pH dependent conformational changes of whey proteins. The in vivo flavour (2-nonanone) release from solutions of WPI and sodium caseinate was investigated using proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry. During consumption, 2-nonanone was partly released from WPI, whereas there was no significant release from sodium caseinate. Even after swallowing of the samples, a substantial amount of flavour was detected in the breath, suggesting that the milk proteins interact with the mucosa in the mouth and throat, resulting in a further release of flavour from mucosa-bound proteins. An increase in viscosity of the protein solutions by the addition of carboxymethylcellulose enhanced the release of 2-nonanone from WPI, and resulted in 2-nonanone release from sodium caseinate. This may be due to a thicker coating of the mucosa with the sample solution after swallowing due to the higher viscosity, resulting in additional release of protein-bound flavour. These findings contribute to the knowledge of the interactions that occur between flavour compounds and proteins, which is required to improve food flavouring and to make protein based foods, e.g., low-fat dairy products, sensorily more acceptable to the consumer. The results also emphasize a careful choice of food processing conditions, such as temperature, high pressure or pH to obtain a desirable flavour profile.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Protein-flavour interactions</field><field name="subject">Dairy products</field><field name="subject">Food flavour</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290103 Food processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1426</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Testing and extending self-control theory of crime : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Williams, Mei Wah</field><field name="description">Self-control theory of crime has had considerable impact on mainstream criminology since it was first published in 1990 by Gottfredson and Hirschi. It is regarded as the most parsimonious criminological theory currently available and has been empirically tested across diverse populations and behaviours. Considerable empirical evidence supports the generality of self-control in predicting crime and analogous behaviours, with low self-control ranked as one of the strongest risk factors for crime. Of substantive concern however is a lack of explanatory power in the theory, a problem that besets criminological theorising in general. This study attempted to integrate self-control theory with theory of planned behaviour (TPB). Whilst self-control provides a stable-dispositional explanation for propensity to crime, TPB is interested in the decision-making processes related to involvement in crime. As such, the study examined the relationship between time-stable self-control and the mediating role of situational-specific factors in the causation of crime. The purpose of the study is twofold. Firstly to investigate the underlying mechanism by which a person with low self-control may have greater propensity to crime and secondly to increase the explanatory value of self-control theory. Three disparate groups were used to explore the single theories and the integrated theory; female students, male students, and prison inmates. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling were conducted to examine the sufficiency of the theories to explain intention to commit crime across three groups. Low self-control was unable to explain behavioural intentions for students but was successful in explaining intentions to do crime in a prison population. The motivational elements of TPB, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control, were shown to exert considerable influence on intention to do crime across the three samples but not attitude. The integrated theory increased the explanatory value of self-control theory for prison inmates over and above its constituent theories. These findings were not replicated with male and female students, raising questions about the generality of self-control theory.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular Genetics of Immunity in the Sydney Rock Oyster (Saccostrea glomerata)</field><field name="creator">Timothy Green</field><field name="description">Mass mortalities of farmed Sydney rock oyster, Saccostrea glomerata, have been observed in Australia since the 1970s and are attributed to the paramyxean protozoan parasite, Marteilia sydneyi (etiological agent of QX disease). This opportunistic parasite infects S. glomerata when the oyster&#8217;s immune system has been compromised due to one or more unknown transient environmental stressor. Management and prevention of the disease is seriously compromised as neither the risk factors for the disease, nor the complete life cycle of M. sydneyi are currently understood. The future of the rock oyster industry relies on the development of QX-resistant oysters. Selection of S. glomerata for resistance to QX disease over several generations has revealed that QX-resistance is heritable and likely to be controlled by multiple genes. The main focuses of this thesis was to improve our knowledge of the genes involved in immunity of S. glomerata to disease. The transcriptome response of hemocytes isolated from S. glomerata selected over four generations for resistance to QX disease (QXR4) was compared to non-selected control oysters (W-type) using suppression, subtractive hybridization (SSH) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Our data supported that differences in gene expression due to selection was largely attributable to constitutive differences in transcriptional rate. The basal-expression of an extracellular superoxide dismutase (EcSOD) and small heat shock protein (sHsP) was 3.18- and 2.05-fold higher in QXR4 oysters, respectively (p &lt; 0.5). The basal-expression of peroxiredoxin 6 (Prx6) and interferon inhibiting cytokine (IK) was 2.75- and 1.5-fold lower in QXR4 oysters, respectively (p &lt; 0.5). Expression of EcSOD, Prx6 and IK was measured in S. glomerata in response to injection with a range of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to replicate microbial invasion as QX disease cannot be replicated in the laboratory due to the complex life cycle of M. sydneyi. The expression of IK was induced 2.2-fold in S. glomerata in response to injection with double stranded RNA when compared to control oysters (p &lt; 0.05). However, changes in the expression of EcSOD and Prx6 could not be induced with any of the tested PAMPs (p &gt; 0.5), suggesting the difference in basal-expression of these two genes between QXR4 and W-type oysters would be maintained during infection with M. sydneyi. It was concluded that QXR4 oysters would be able to generate the anti-parasitic compound, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) faster due to the elevated levels of EcSOD and that the H2O2 would reach higher concentrations due to the reduced levels of Prx6 to detoxify it. Attempts were made to understand why the basal expression of EcSOD and Prx6 is different between QXR4 and W-type oysters. Identification of DNA variants within the promoter regions of these genes would provide greater insight into the gene network(s) involved in disease resistance and possibly lead to identification of QX-resistant markers that can be applied to the Sydney rock oyster breeding program. The differential expression of EcSOD and Prx6 is likely to originate from either modifications in transcriptional rate or mRNA stability as the percentage of hemocytes that express these two genes was shown to be equal between QXR4 and W-type oysters using in-situ hybridization (p &gt; 0.5). Attempts to amplify and assemble the full-length EcSOD gene from S. glomerata were unsuccessful. The full Prx6 gene was amplified and the frequency of polymorphisms that affected mRNA stability and transcriptional rate were determine between QX-resistant and &#8211;susceptible S. glomerata (N = 15). Notably, the frequency of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter region (-240A&gt;G) affected the binding of a heat shock factor. The genotypic frequency of -240G/G was 0.400 in resistant oysters compared to 0.067 in susceptible oysters (p = 0.059). Further validation of this SNP is now required using a larger data set. Monitoring survival and histological observations of S. glomerata over the 2006/2007 and 2007/2008 QX disease risk period in the Pimpama River, SE Queensland provided further support to anecdotal evidence that mortality of S. glomerata occurs after heavy summer rainfall in SE Queensland. It is presumed that heavy rainfall causes the immune system of S. glomerata to become compromised, presumably by a reduction in salinity and/or estuarine acidification from a rising water table leading to leaching of acid sulfate soils. Laboratory trials revealed a drop in salinity from 35 ppt to 15 ppt affected immune gene expression and inhibition of the Prx6 gene could still be detected five days after oysters were returned to normal seawater. Acid sulfate soil leachate had no effect on the expression of immune genes or immunological parameters tested. This result provides further support to existing evidence that reduced salinity causes the immune system of S. glomerata to be compromised, possibly resulting in higher mortality of S. glomerata when subsequently challenged with M. sydneyi. Examination of S. glomerata during the QX disease risk period revealed oysters were often infected with other parasites. The microsporidian parasite, Steinhausia sp. was frequently observed infecting the gonad tissue of female S. glomerata in histological sections. This infection resulted in hemocytic infiltration and re-absorption of gonad tissue, possibly resulting in reduced growth rates, condition index and marketablity. The frequency of this parasite in oyster samples taken from Moreton Bay, SE Queensland, suggests this parasite could be an emerging problem for oyster farmers in SE Queensland. Differences in the bacterial community within the digestive gland of S. glomerata infected and un-infected with M. sydneyi was observed using non-culture techniques. Healthy oysters had a diverse bacterial community with 23 different operational taxonomic units (OTUs) identified. In contrast, S. glomerata infected with M. sydneyi had only one OTU present in the digestive gland, which was closely related to a Rickettsiales-like prokaryote (RLP) based on phylogenetic analysis of its 16S rDNA sequence. This RLP may be detrimental to its host during concurrent infection with M. sydneyi and warrants further investigation. Overall, this project demonstrated resistance of S. glomerata to M. sydneyi is likely to involve constitutive differences in gene expression. Identification of DNA variants within the promoter regions of differentially expressed genes may provide further insight into gene regulation within oysters and allow identification of DNA markers for selecting QX-resistant brood-stock. Results presented in this thesis support anecdotal evidence that S. glomerata are more susceptible to M. sydneyi following periods of high rainfall as a result of reduced salinity compromising the immune system of S. glomerata. Histological observation of S. glomerata over the QX-disease risk period revealed that oysters were often infected with a range of other parasites. The presence of these parasites may also compromise the immune system of S. glomerata during the QX-disease risk period. The implications of their presence must be factored in to future breeding and research programmes.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oyster, Saccostrea, QX disease, Marteilia, Gene Expression, Immunity, Parasitology.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205564</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy in the Cessation of Long-Term Benzodiazepine Use</field><field name="creator">Jannette Parr</field><field name="description">Benzodiazepines have been widely prescribed since the 1960s for the management of adverse symptoms related to anxiety, depression, and sleep problems. They were regarded as an efficacious medication when compared with their predecessor, barbiturates. Within 10 years of their introduction, concerns began to be raised regarding their potential to produce dependence and withdrawal symptoms when ceased, including symptoms not present prior to their being prescribed. Subsequent research focussed on establishing effective strategies to ameliorate the adverse symptoms experienced even when the daily intake was slowly reduced. The aim of the work undertaken for this doctorate was to establish whether there was a role for cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) in benzodiazepine cessation. The initial step in conducting the research for this doctorate was to obtain a detailed understanding of the current state of research on benzodiazepine cessation. Study 1 therefore focussed on establishing the effectiveness of treatment approaches used to assist individuals to cease benzodiazepine use. A Meta-analysis of treatment strategies undertaken in general practice and outpatient settings established that brief intervention resulted in superior cessation rates at post-treatment than routine care. Gradual dose reduction plus CBT was slightly superior to gradual dose reduction alone. However, substitutive pharmacotherapies in combination with gradual dose reduction did not result in a superior outcome to gradual dose reduction alone, and substitutive pharmacotherapy plus abrupt benzodiazepine cessation was less effective than gradual dose reduction. While, providing CBT in conjunction with gradual dose reduction offered a superior outcome than gradual dose reduction alone, current evidence does not identify the CBT strategies that contributed to the superior outcome. The next step in the development of the CBT intervention involved obtaining a deep appreciation of the issues relating to cessation from the perspective of General Practitioners (GPs) and Benzodiazepine Users (BzUs). Accordingly, Study 2 administered semi-structured interviews about benzodiazepine use and its cessation to 28 GPs and 23 BzUs. Responses were analysed using the Consensual Qualitative Research approach, as it enabled comparisons to be made between the views of the two groups of interviewees. The study identified commonality between GPs and BzUs on reasons for commencing use, the role of dependence in continued use, and the importance of lifestyle change in its cessation. BzUs felt there was greater need for GPs to routinely advise patients about non-pharmacological management of their problems and potential adverse consequences of long-term use before prescribing benzodiazepines. Few GPs had assisted a patient to cease use reportedly due to the required time and the expectation of a poor outcome. There was a perception that patients wanted a pharmacological solution to their problems. A critical gap in assessment instruments that are needed for a comprehensive assessment of the outcomes from a treatment trial was identified. In particular, there was no measure of benzodiazepine expectancy or self-efficacy concerning maintenance of benzodiazepine dose reduction. Therefore, Study 3 adapted existing expectancy and self-efficacy measures form other substance domains to verify their applicability to benzodiazepines. Current BzUs (n = 155) were invited to complete two questionnaires either online or via hard copy. Principal component analysis (PCA) of a newly developed Benzodiazepine Expectancy Questionnaire (BEQ) resulted an 18-item, 2-factor scale, while a Benzodiazepine Refusal Self Efficacy Questionnaire (BRSEQ) formed a 16-item, 4-factor scale, Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in a second sample (n = 139) confirmed these internal structures, reducing the BEQ to 12 items and the BRSEQ to 14 items respectively. The qualitative study suggested that many GPs would be reluctant to engage in psychological support for benzodiazepine cessation and it was evident that specialist services would be unable to provide substantial support especially in rural and remote areas. Accordingly, it was decided to develop a treatment that was remotely delivered. The initial pilot used a correspondence-based approach, delivered via the postal service. Study 4 comprised a small pilot comparing GP managed gradual dose reduction, plus CBT via mail (M-CBT), which was either delivered immediately (IM-CBT) or after 3 months (DM-CBT). Despite substantial efforts over a 2 year period to recruit GPs and BzUs, only 6 received the allocated intervention. It was decided to trial the intervention as an internet-delivered program to enhance its accessibility to BzUs. Access to the program was promoted through the project website and links from high profile support websites. Study 5 was an uncontrolled trial of internet-based CBT (I-CBT). Access was provided to all newsletters, although, participants were given a suggested sequence for access. Despite placement on the internet and cross-listing on several key websites, the study still only recruited 35 participants (3 of which received the program by mail). Of the 32 undertaking the program via the internet, 21 completed the 3-month assessments and 14 the 6-month assessments. Eight participants reduced their weekly benzodiazepine intake by at least 50%, by 3 months, with five ceasing use at 6 months. A significant increase in self-efficacy, and a decrease in depressive symptoms and dependence were seen. Providing CBT either via mail or the internet assisted some participants to reduce or cease long-term benzodiazepine use. Recruitment to both M-CBT and I-CBT was limited, despite substantial attempts to market the intervention. The studies undertaken for this doctorate make a unique contribution to improving treatment outcomes for people wishing to cease long-term benzodiazepine use. They also provide direction for more extensive studies to definitively establish the nature of effective treatment. The current evidence clearly supports the importance of gradual dose reduction and the role of CBT in further improving treatment outcomes. However, engagement of both BzUs and GPs remains challenging. Remote delivery of CBT via mail or the internet may assist with improving access to CBT, but it does not solve the problem of GP and BzU engagement. An effective system-wide program to address long-term benzodiazepine use will require that incentives for GP involvement (a disincentive for long-term prescription) are in place.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">adjunctive treatment</field><field name="subject">benzodiazepines</field><field name="subject">cessation</field><field name="subject">cognitive-behaviour therapy</field><field name="subject">general practitioner</field><field name="subject">long-term use</field><field name="subject">meta-analysis</field><field name="subject">qualitative</field><field name="subject">review</field><field name="subject">self-managed</field><field name="subject">substitutive pharmacotherapy</field><field name="subject">withdrawal</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Empirical Study of Design Management Practices in Collaborative Design and Construction Projects The Roles, Activities and Conceptions of Design Management across Project Stages and within the Building, Civil and Process Sectors of a Construction Compa</field><field name="creator">Janthea Andersen</field><field name="description">Abstract The construction industry is at a critical point in time where the construction and design of the majority of projects is now done simultaneously. If historical trends persist, then there will be an increase in the number of construction projects done concurrently with design. This empirical study describes the management of design in collaborative design and construction projects in a construction company that is dealing with an increasing number of collaboration type projects. The different roles of managers of design, the activities they undertook and conceptions that could describe the practice were researched. A major outcome of the research was the identification of seven major activities that were undertaken by the design managers. These were: 1. Coordinating Stakeholder Input 2. Coordinating Design Work with Other Work 3. Managing Design 4. Project Development Management 5. Managing Design Work 6. Selecting and Managing the Design Team 7. Managing Design Management It was found that design management went through three distinct stages in the collaborative projects: 1. An early stage comprising of mostly design development and planning activities 2. A mid stage consisting of collaborative design and construction activities 3. A latter stage, which comprised of completing the construction work Design managers also undertook activities outside of the project stages, which were considered as company based activities. In the early stages activities were orientated towards developing the project, dealing with different design solutions and setting up the project. In the mid stages activities were orientated towards obtaining design for construction, producing one design solution and keeping up with the schedule. In the latter stages activities were orientated towards dealing with design issues and maintaining design intent. Activities outside of any project were orientated towards developing personnel and company systems. The goals of each stage and the activities required to reach those goals changed the nature of design management in each stage and ultimately resulted in a change in the person required to manage the design. Design managers with the ability to establish client relationships and develop the design were required in the early stages and design managers with the ability to manage the production of design documents and deal with construction issues were required in the mid stages. Different design managers were utilised for the early and mid project stages. During the latter stages of a project, when design was practically completed, design managers had a part time or consultant type role in the projects. In order to examine design management, seven conceptions that could describe the practice of design management were explored. The conceptions consisted of, &#8216;brand management&#8217;, &#8216;design and construction integration&#8217;, &#8216;a division of project management&#8217;, &#8216;meta-design&#8217;, &#8216;master builder&#8217;, &#8216;task, flow and value management&#8217; and &#8216;management of the design process&#8217;. No one single conception was observed to adequately describe everything that the design managers did. Rather each conception provided a useful perspective that adequately described design management in particular situations. For example &#8216;a division of project management&#8217; more readily described situations where design managers undertook planning, cost and design production related activities. Similarly &#8216;meta-design&#8217; more readily described situations where design managers were involved in design discussions. The trends of the conceptions across project stages revealed where the conceptions more readily applied. For example, &#8216;brand management&#8217;, &#8216;task, flow and value management&#8217; and &#8216;master builder&#8217; applied more in the early stages of the projects, when the design managers had to promote the company and design, determine the flow of information and had more control over the direction of the project. In the mid stages the conceptions &#8216;design and construction integration&#8217; and &#8216;management of the design process&#8217; more readily applied, as design process activity was increased and as construction activities required coordination with design. &#8216;Design and construction integration&#8217;, &#8216;brand management&#8217; and &#8216;master builder&#8217; conceptions applied in the later stages where construction activities were checked against the design, the construction required promotion and where the design manager dealt with quality and economic issues with the design. This research explores design management in the Civil and Process sectors of the construction company, in addition to the Building sector. Differences were found between the Building, Civil and Process sectors. In the Building sector, design managers took more ownership of a project; in the Civil sector, design managers carefully took into account stakeholder issues; and in the Process sector, design managers were more technically orientated. These insights into the management of design in integrated design and construction projects can be incorporated into management structures, personnel selection and training programs. For example, the results of this research can be used for the training and selection of design managers for the early, mid and latter stages of design and construction projects. The research can also be used as a basis for making improvements to design management. For example, current practices can be compared to the results of this research to determine which activities might need greater prioritisation. This research provides practitioners and academics with renewed ways of thinking about the management of design, based on the actual practices of design managers.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">architect</field><field name="subject">build</field><field name="subject">collaborative</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">design and construction</field><field name="subject">design manager</field><field name="subject">engineer</field><field name="subject">integrated</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206033</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ADVANCED APPROACHES FOR ELECTRICITY MARKET PRICE FORECASTING</field><field name="creator">Xia Chen</field><field name="description">Electricity price forecasting is an important task for electricity market participants since the very beginning of the deregulation. Accurate forecasting is essential for designing bidding strategy, risk management, and market operation. However, due to the compli-cated factors affecting electricity prices, there are more uncertainties in electricity price forecasting and hence more complex than demand forecasting. This makes accurate price forecasting very difficult. In the last decade, several methods have been developed in order to fully capture the peculiarities of electricity price dynamics, from classic econometric time series models, e.g., autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model, generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model to modern machine learning based techniques such as artificial neural networks (ANN) and sup-port vector machine (SVM). In spite of all models proposed in the literature, there is still no clear consensus about which model is substantively outperforming others. Therefore, when a single method is used, decision-makers are facing the risk of not choosing the best one. On the other hand, the prediction of electricity market prices still involves large errors. If decision-makers take the prediction result on faith, prediction errors could exposure them to serious financial risks. Based on these findings, it can conclude that (1) systematic methodologies and implementations which can efficiently address model selection uncertainty in price forecasting require an investigation; (2) more powerful and robust price forecasting models are still needed to reduce the fore-cast errors; and (3) In addition, the emphasis of price forecasting should shift away from point forecast to uncertainty around the forecast. Unfortunately, most researches in this area have been devoted to finding the single &#8220;best&#8221; estimates rather than dealing with the uncertainty in model selection and quantifying the predictive uncertainty. In this thesis the research focus is on: (1) finding methodologies and efficient imple-mentations to deal with the uncertainty in model selection; (2) developing more power-ful machine learning based approaches to model electricity spot prices and further im-proving the accuracy of electricity market price forecast; and (3) incorporating uncer-tainty estimation into the application of price forecasting. The thesis makes three main contributions to the study of this topic. Firstly, it proposes linear, nonlinear forecast combination frameworks to deal with model selection prob-lem; secondly, it introduces two novel models: support vector machine based nonlinear generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model (SVM-GARCH) and extreme learning machine (ELM) to the price forecasting and furthermore gives a series of bootstrap-based interval construction procedures to quantify the prediction uncer-tainty. Finally, it proposes a more robust interval forecasting approach which is based on quantile regression to electricity price forecasting literature. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approaches have been tested based on real market data of Australian National Electricity Market (NEM).</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">09 Engineering</field><field name="subject">Electricity market price forecasting, model uncertainty, probabilistic interval forecasting</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206035</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding Effects of Nanoparticle Dispersion on Physical and Mechanical Properties of HA/PHBV Nanocomposites</field><field name="creator">Wadcharawadee Noohom</field><field name="description">This thesis is inspired by a persistent limitation in the use of composite biomaterials for orthopaedic applications, namely the agglomeration of reinforcing particles in these composites, which has resulted in poor mechanical properties. The use of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) and hydroxyapatite (HA) nanoparticles to produce biodegradable nanocomposites is investigated. More specifically, the thesis investigates different methods of composite processing, and interfacial modifying agents and the effect that these have on the nano- and micro- scale structure of composites and their mechanical properties. PHBV and HA were chosen because PHBV is a biodegradable/biocompatible polymer and it has a relatively high stiffness when compared to other biodegradable polymers frequently used in orthopaedic applications. HA is chemically similar to ceramic phase found in bones and hard tissues and the inclusion of HA into biomedical materials has been shown to enhance the rate of osteoconduction. HA/PHBV composites were produced using different dispersing agents including poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), a model dispersing agent, polyethyleneimine (PEI) which allowed for the development of a single solvent system for composite preparation, and heparin (Hep), a macromolecule which is produced in vivo. Additionally, HA/PAA/PHBV composites were prepared from both sonicated and non-sonicated HA/PAA suspensions up to approximately 17% by weight (wt %) of HA content. Attempts to prepare composites with higher HA loadings led to inhomogeneous composite mixtures, which were caused by the dual solvent system used for the composite preparation. The HA/PEI/PHBV and HA/Hep/PHBV composites were produced up to approximately 75 wt % of HA content. It was found that the HA/PEI/PHBV and HA/Hep/PHBV composites could be prepared at higher loadings than HA/PAA/PHBV composites due to the single solvent system used for the preparation of the HA/PEI/PHBV composites and the better dispersion of HA/Hep particles in precursor suspensions. Finally, selected HA/PEI/PHBV composites were further processed using a twin screw extruder. All of the composites were characterised in terms of their dispersion levels as well as their compressive mechanical properties. In addition, HA/PEI/PHBV composite reinforced with 20 wt % of HA content was also tested for its mechanical properties using three different test types; compression, three-point bending, and tensile tests. Finally, the HA/PAA/PHBV, HA/PEI/PHBV, and HA/Hep/PHBV composites were tested their compressive mechanical properties in wet state. It was found that the sonicated HA/PAA suspensions in general had better colloidal stability than non-sonicated ones and that this yielded composites with superior compressive moduli than those prepared from non-sonicated suspensions. In addition, the better dispersion of the particles in the composites prepared from the sonicated suspensions, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images, led to higher percentage crystallinities when compared to the composites prepared from non-sonicated suspensions. It is likely that the greater number of individual HA particles and smaller HA agglomerates observed in the composites prepared from sonication treatment are acting as nuclei for crystal growth more effectively than large HA agglomerates. The largest modulus and yield strength that could be achieved with this system were approximately 1.45 GPa and 80 MPa, respectively. Composites of HA/PEI/PHBV and HA/Hep/PHBV with approximately 55 wt % of HA content were found to exhibit the largest compressive moduli of approximately 2.5 and 2.8 GPa, respectively. Moreover, the yield strengths for the same materials were found to be approximately 123 and 120 MPa, respectively. This was found to correlate with the better levels of dispersion within the nanocomposites that could be achieved using these stabilisers. The extruded samples were found to have an even greater degree of particle dispersion when compared to the unextruded ones. This improved degree of particle dispersion of the extruded samples resulted in higher moduli in comparison to unextruded samples. The largest compressive modulus and yield strength of the extruded samples were found to be approximately 3.2 GPa and 125 MPa, respectively. The compressive moduli of the composites produced in this thesis are significantly greater than that of cancellous bone (0.4 GPa), but significantly lower than that of cortical bone (12.8&#8211;17.7 GPa). However, maximum yield strengths of the HA/PEI/PHBV and HA/Hep/PHBV composites match to cortical bone (120&#8211;180 MPa), which is a noteworthy finding in this thesis. The wet mechanical results of all composites as well as pure PHBV polymer showed a reduction in both moduli and yield strengths when compared to dry state. In addition, after 2 weeks in wet state both moduli and yield strengths of the composites and pure polymer converged to approximately the same values. Finally, the HA/PEI/PHBV composite samples tested by tensile testing showed the highest Young&#8217;s modulus and those tested by compression testing possessed the lowest Young&#8217;s modulus. This resulted from the difference in periods of time for heating exposure and void contents of the tested samples, which were prepared by different methods. However, toughness values obtained from the samples tested using three-point bending and tensile tests, was not significantly different.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hydroxyapatite, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate), composites, nano-sized, dispersion, mechanical properties, Young&#8217;s modulus, strength, crystallinities, bone</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206173</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Guinea pathology : a morphological study of human disease in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Cooke, Robin A.

In this study, several methods were used to reduce copper activation of pyrite during grinding or to minimise its effect on the flotation of pyrite at pH 9.0.

Next, Sepstrup's criteria (1991 cited in Thomsen, 1996) are used to contrast and compare traditional media and the Web medium. The differences are manifestly pointed out in terms of reach, selectivity, feedback, information capacity and costs. Measuring the effectiveness of media is one important topic of the Web medium that researchers take into consideration nowadays.

It examines discursive cultural practices, including pedagogical practices, through the lens of whiteness as a way of understanding how teaching and learning about a religious tradition other than white Christianity might act to reproduce white race dominance in secondary religious education curricula in the Australian context. The study draws on a number of key theoretical insights from the work of the French post structuralist Jacques Derrida including his critique of the metaphysics of presence, his reply in 'difference', and his general 'strategy' of deconstruction. The study argues that 'whiteness', as a racialised position of institutional power and privilege exists as an absent presence in religion education curricula and that its dominance and privilege is reproduced through its (regulated) invisibility. This argument is illustrated through an examination of some of the literature that informs the teaching and learning of religion education in schools, an examination of the history of public religion education in South Australia, and principally through an examination of the history of discursive cultural practices that occurred during the teaching of a unit of work on Buddhism under the SACE Stage 1 'Studies in Religion' Extended Subject Framework within four religion education classrooms in metropolitan Adelaide. The study is a multi-sited micro-ethnography in which some of the discursive cultural practices of white race dominance that circulate throughout broader white Australian society are examined across and within the specificities of four different religion education sites. A number of methodological considerations are involved in a study such as this. The problems of race identification between a researcher and participants, power differentials between a researcher and participants, particularly when many of those participants are school children, and the issue of representation is discussed. Written portraits of each of the class sites are given as a way of signalling the heterogeneity of the cultural field in which religion education occurs. A selection of narratives from teachers and students, and some of the storylines that circulated throughout each of the classrooms, is examined for the ways in which the invisibility of whiteness acts to limit and enable the ways in which teachers and students are able to engage with Buddhism and Buddhists as the object of their study. The study highlights that in spite of good intentions and good will, religion educators and students of religion are implicated in the maintenance of white race privilege through practices that are often re-articulations of a colonial past that continues to structure the world through strict binaries of opposition. The study argues that there is a need for religion educators to begin to 'see' the invisibility of whiteness in religion education. Following Miedema and Biesta I argue for the need for religion educators to ???take responsibility for an otherness that can never become fully present???, that can never be fully known and with whom dialogue can only ever be incomplete. I suggest that what is required for a more socially just religion education curriculum and more socially just religion practices is a willingness on the part of religion educators to open ourselves to the ???unforeseeable in-coming of the other???

Globally, Asia has the lowest overall figures of safe water supply coverage and sanitation coverage: almost two-thirds of those without access to improved water supply and approximately 80% of those without access to improved sanitation. However, in Sri Lanka, 81% of total population has adequate sanitation facilities and 78% are using improved drinking line water sources (UN 2002). The lack of good sewage treatment is a cause of sickness and disease, a major environmental threat to any country's water resources, and a fundamental stumbling block in the advancement of human dignity. The importance of sewage treatment must be understood by both public and government. Currently there is a positive trend in treating sewage. Sewage treatment in Sri Lanka has been developing strongly in the last two decades. Still there are many challenges to be overcome associated with the sewage treatment industry. Public awareness is the most important issue. The National Water Supply and Drainage Board which is under the Ministry of Urban Development and Water Supply is the main governing agency in Sri Lanka for sewage treatment and has been actively involved in its improvement. Also, local government authorities, the Environmental Protection Authority, non governmental organizations and the public are involved in the drive to achieve worlds' best practice in this area. I had been working at Sewerage Section of Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau, Sri Lanka since graduation, March 2002. At that time, I was really interested to do some work related to sewage treatment in Sri Lanka. It motivated me to choose 'Sewage Treatment in Sri Lanka' project as my hydrology and water resources supervised project.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sewage</field><field name="subject">Water quality management</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/78232</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of customer satisfaction and switching costs on customer retention : a survey of retail internet banking users in Hong Kong</field><field name="creator">Wong, Chi Bo</field><field name="description">The exponential growth of the Internet is changing the way corporations conduct business with customers. The banking industry is no exception. In order to sustain competitiveness, banks have been introducing more Internet banking services. However, this change undermines the ability of business to retain their customers since certain characteristics of the Internet can cause a reduction in customers' search costs, reduce barrier to entry, and diminish distinctiveness of a firm (Kalakota and Whinston, 1996). Managing effective customer retention strategies is increasingly important in the banking industry since the length in years of customer relationships is one of the most important factors that contributes to the bank's profitability. Reicheld (1996) found that a five percent increase in customer loyalty produces an eighty-five percent increase in profitability in the banking industry. In the past, the key to understanding the power of a corporation to retain customers was thought to lie in the measurement of customer satisfaction. Clarke (2001) argued that long-term customer retention in competitive requires firms to go beyond mere basic satisfaction and to look for ways of establishing ties of loyalty that will help ward off competitive attack. While customer satisfaction may be one important driver of customer retention, switching costs are also likely to influence customer retention, both independently and in tandem. For example, the presence of switching costs can mean that some seemingly retained customers are actually dissatisfied but do not defect because of high switching costs. Thus the level of switching costs has a moderating effect on the relationship between customer satisfaction and customer retention. While the moderating role of switching costs on the relationship between customer satisfaction and customer retention has been supported in literature for existing non-Internet contexts (Lee et al., 2001; Ranaweera and Prabhu, 2003), little research has been published within the Internet context and particularly Internet banking. Based on a review of the literature, a theoretical model linking customer satisfaction and switching costs to customer retention was developed. The model has two main features. First, it examines the main direct effects of customer satisfaction and switching costs on customer retention. Second, the model examines the moderating role of switching costs on the relationship between customer satisfaction and customer retention. The empirical research was based on data collected by an Internet survey of adopters of Internet banking service in Hong Kong. Results from statistical analyses show that both customer satisfaction and switching costs have strong positive direct effects on customer retention. These analyses also confirm the moderating role of switching costs on the relationship between customer satisfaction and customer retention. However, when Internet banking adopters are categorized into two segments according to their usage of Internet banking service (basic and advanced users), results show that switching costs play a significant moderating role on the relationship between customer satisfaction and customer retention only for the basic Internet banking users.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internet banking</field><field name="subject">Consumer satisfaction</field><field name="subject">Banks and banking</field><field name="subject">Banks and banking</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/81310</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:43946</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study on the national competitiveness of India with reference to the passenger car industry based on the application of Michael Porter's model on national competitive advantage to the State of Tamil Nadu</field><field name="creator">Chow, Charles Hoi Hee</field><field name="description">Based on the application of Porter's Model for National Competitive Advantage to the state of Tamil Nadu, the author established four unique characteristics about India. These are: Tamil Nadu is India's southern gateway; Indian consumers are very price sensitive; Indians have links somehow everywhere; and India thrives on contrasts. These attributes were further distilled to arrive at three 'stones' that can pave improvements to the Indian passenger car industry, namely: 'Cornerstone', being the need to improve local propensity to earn; 'Stepping Stones', being the need to intensify engagements with regional groupings like the Indian Ocean Rim (IOR), South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC), Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand Economic Co-operation (BIMSTEC) and the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN); and 'Flintstone' being Tamil Nadu as an auto hub to ignite entrepreneurship and innovations within the Indian passenger car industry. In essence Porter's Theory on National Competitive Advantage states that prosperity depends on environment, not endowments. His Diamond Model helps identify the productive clusters that can support such wealth creation. This study bridges the gap between identification and implementation with an 'International Management Grid' that divides action agenda in accordance with structure, strategy, culture and control. This matrix is bounded by classification of items according to urgency and importance, whereby delegation, empowerment, tact and leadership would be emphasized accordingly. The central thesis of this study is that wealth creation can be initiated by a progressive location in a country through the cascading effects of a high growth industry. With faster physical and communication connectivity and increased global concerns for security and health, India's major challenge is to associate her passenger car industry with: Speed in sustaining human relationships; trendy yet affordable replacements instead of renewal repairs; and life-long learning for skills that ensure employment and employability. A permanent Exhibition Centre is recommended to especially showcase new developments in textiles, leather and security technologies for cars. In addition, a virtual Auto Centre of Excellence, managed as an internet platform based in Tamil Nadu, can help international members of the industry to upgrade and research on skills that ensure individual employment and employability through a life-long knowledge management and certification process. A unique post-sale advantage of cars made in India can be the guaranteed inspection after five years to replace or overhaul vehicle parts in franchise centres located throughout India and overseas. These franchises will help train Indian youths through an honour code of 3-in-1-youth mentorship scheme. Those who have benefited from working in these franchises would be obliged to mentor three other youths within five years after completion of their own mentorship. All these initiatives can start with Tamil Nadu because she is already an automotive manufacturing hub, a southern IT centre and an export gateway. This study has reviewed criticisms on Porter's Model, especially from Krugman, Dunning, Narula, Rugman and D'Cruz as well as Davis and Ellis. Although the model has been applied to developing economies like Korea, Venezuela, Turkey, Phillippines and even India, this study is different. None of the previous academic exercises using Porter's Model has an implementation format like the 'International Management Grid' as designed and developed by the author. The Delphi Research Technique in accordance with the Gordon and Helmer Method was adopted for 58 candidates and the results of fieldwork were found to be statistically significant at 0.05 level based on the non-parametric Chi-Squared Test of Independence. The ethical aspects in Porter's Model and the new business rhythm inside India after more privatization remain major unsolved issues of this study.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Competition, International</field><field name="subject">International business enterprises</field><field name="subject">Automobile industry and trade</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/81330</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:43925</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular dynamics simulations of shear in fluids and slip at the solid boundary</field><field name="creator">Galea, Toni-Marie</field><field name="description">Thesis (PhD)--University of South Australia, 2003</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Molecular dynamics</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/81041</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:43759</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intelligent techniques for decision support system in tactical air combat environment</field><field name="creator">Tran, Cong Minh</field><field name="description">The thesis presents research on decision-making in the Tactical Air Combat Environment (TACE). Decision-making occurs often in situations such as business, marketing, medicine and management. In some cases the decision can be quickly made if we have sufficient information or a clear need for the work. In complex cases involving uncertain information, the decision making process is hard and ambiguous. It is difficult to choose or to provide good solutions in areas such as medical treatment, business management or in the battlefield. The model of the tactical air combat environment decision support system is used as the trial model for the Decision Support System (DSS) for the Airborne Early Warning Command and Control (AEW&amp;C). This system is currently designed and developed in the Air Operation Department of the Defence Science Technology Organisation (DSTO) in Australia. The cognitive work analysis (CWA) theory has been investigated and developed in recent years to analyse and develop the human system interaction process to support decision making in TACE. The situation Awareness (SA) theory is also investigated. The thesis introduces theories of decision making and the intelligent techniques that can support the decision making process. Fuzzy Logic or Expert Systems will be used to implement the heuristic knowledge. The training process derived from experience or object recognition will be good useful for the decision making process. Neural network using the back propagatino learning algorithm and its optimisation approaches will be used for this task. Usually a decision support system is made to solve problems where multi-criteria decision are involved. The database is the vital part of the decision support which contains the information or data used in the decision making process. This is where engineers and scientists use several heuristics and soft computing techinques such as learning, search and modelling of imprecise information to obtain optimal decisions. The thesis proposes hybrid intelligent techniques using a fuzzy genetic system and a fuzzy neural system to obtain decision rules automatically. The fuzzy inference system is used to process the imprecise information. Some simulation results demonstrate the difficulties in deciding the optimal quantity of membership functions; shape and parameters are also given. The last part of the thesis explicates a combination of unsupervised learning techniques for clustering the data that is proposed in order to develop decision regions for the fuzzy c mean clustering and self organisation map. It uses a feed forward neural network to classify the decision regions accurately. The clustered data is used for the inputs to the multi-layered feed forward neural network, which is trained using several higher order learning paradigms. Experimental results obtained show the proposed method is efficient.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Decision support systems</field><field name="subject">Artificial intelligence</field><field name="subject">Electronics in military engineering</field><field name="subject">Air warfare</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/80504</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:43918</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparison of on-line and in-store customer behaviour in wine retailing</field><field name="creator">Stening, Sally</field><field name="description">Researchers have been quick to illustrate how traditional retail theory can be adapted to e-tail (Spiller and Lohse, 1997, 1998; Eroglu, Machleit and Davis, 2000). Similarly traditional high street retailers (bricks and mortar retailers) have sought to replicate their offering on-line via the internet. Despite the apparent parallels between on-line and in-store retail, practitioners merely replicating their in-store offering on-line have been unable to compete in this new format and in many cases have seen one format cannibalise the other (Chen and Leteney, 2000; Enders and Jalessi, 2000). Although there are obvious differences between the Internet and traditional bricks and mortar retail formats, there are likely to be some retail theories that hold true for both formats. This thesis provides a starting point in determining how existing retail knowledge can be adapted to the Internet by comparing aspects of customer behaviour on and off-line. The advent of the World Wide Web (WWW) signified global opportunities for members and stakeholders of the wine industry. Wine retailers have been quick to trial the on-line format and their trials have been met with varying degrees of success. Wine producers have also seized opportunities to promote and sell their products via the Internet. In recent years tax incentives have been introduced to encourage wine producers to sell directly to the consumer, with most wine producers being located in rural areas the Internet offers an opportunity to bring customers closer to wine products. This thesis utilises data collected through a customer database and via surveys customer behaviour has been compared. The findings of this research show that not only do a unique group of customers use the Internet for their wine purchases, but also that these customers modify their behaviour to maximise the benefit they gain from their on-line transactions. Results show that, contrary to popular belief, customers are not using the Internet to purchase the same products (as they would purchase in-store) at a lower price. A comparison of the same of the same customers purchases on-line and in-store showed customers spent more per item on-line and purchased a greater number of items per transaction on-line compared to in-store. Furthermore, a comparison of these customers' in-store transactions with customers who only purchased in-store, showed that on-line customers spent more per item and purchased in greater quantities than other customers irrespective of format. Individual characteristics identified in this research allow the targeting of customers more likely to adopt the internet as a retail format. By focusing efforts on these individuals marketers can realize optimal results from their efforts. For academic research, the established differences in retail behaviour point to areas where existing retail can be expanded to the Internet and highlight areas for future research.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Consumer behavior</field><field name="subject">Wine</field><field name="subject">Electronic commerce</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/80447</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:43911</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Military aircraft structural testing in Australia : supporting the ADF</field><field name="creator">Harrison, Stephen J</field><field name="description">This minor thesis examines whether or not the Australian Defence Force (ADF) needs an indigenous aircraft structural testing program for military aircraft. Aircraft structural testing is a major test and evaluation activity currently undertaken by the DSTO to provide structural integrity information about particular aircraft for the ADF. The ADF has required this testing to be undertaken because, in general terms, testing undertaken by an aircraft's manufacturer has not been sufficient to meet the needs of the ADF. The research was divided into five sub-problems, which examined the need for aircraft structural testing, the management of these needs, what structural testing is required, how the testing should be managed and how the testing should be conducted. The research was undertaken by conducting five case studies into past, current and future aircraft structural tests being undertaken by the DSTO. The cases examined were the F/A-18 International Follow-On Structural Test Project, the P-3 service life assessment program, the F-111 wing test, the Hawk lead-in fighter full-scale fatigue test and the potential test program for the joint strike fighter (JSF). The basis of the case studies was the conduct of a series of interviews of the DSTO staff relevant to each case being examined. The information gathered through the interviews was supported by material gathered through making observations and reviewing documentation relevant to each case. The research concluded that an indigenous aircraft testing program is required by the ADF in order to maintain the structural integrity of its aircraft fleet. This minor thesis makes some recommendations for the way aircraft structural testing is conducted by the ADF, and the way general management of T &amp; E in the Department of Defence could be improved.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Defence Science and Technology Organisation (Australia)</field><field name="subject">Airplanes, Military</field><field name="subject">Structural stability</field><field name="subject">Airframes</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/80477</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:43891</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of the state of E-Commerce adoption by the SMEs in Northern Malaysia and factors that might hinder its adoption : an empirical study</field><field name="creator">Liew, Voon Kiong</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study is to assess the state of e-commerce adoption by the SMEs in Northern Malaysia and to examine the factors that might hinder the adoption. The methodology employed in this study was questionnaire survey. Questionnaires were sent to the SMEs in Northern who were listed in the latest official business directory of SMI association of Malaysia as well as other sources. Analysis of the data obtained found that the general usage of e-commerce among the SMEs in Northern Malaysia is low; most firms seemed to have implemented only basic e-commerce applications and do not adopt advance e-commerce applications. For example, the most used e-commerce application is email whereas the least used application is online payment system. Furthermore, while a substantial number of the SMEs have implemented web sites, they were used merely to display products and company information rather than having advanced features such as providing online transaction and online payment services. Analysis of benefits realized found that most of the SMEs in Northern Malaysia, which have adopted e-commerce, only gained some of the benefits of e-commerce. Benefits realized were in the areas of customer service, market expansion, and back-end efficiency and inventory management. On the other hand, the SMEs who have adopted e-commerce seemed incapable of improving their overall performance and profitability. Examination of the factors that might hinder the adoption of e-commerce by the SMEs in Northern Malaysia were initially identified through factor analysis as environmental barriers, financial barriers, governmental barriers, technical barriers and behavioural barriers. However, correlation analysis showed that only factors related to organizational, governmental and environmental barriers have some negative influence on the extent of e-commerce usage. Out of the three factors, only the factor associated with environmental barriers has a significant correlation with the extent of e-commerce adoption. Regression analysis confirmed that the factor related to environmental barriers has significant negative influence on the extent of e-commerce adoption. Therefore, it was concluded that while many factors could be hindering the adoption of e-commerce by the SMEs in Northern Malaysia, only the factor pertaining to environmental barriers has significant negative influence on its adoption.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electronic commerce</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/80446</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:43885</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cross-border mergers and acquisitions : motives and value creation</field><field name="creator">Liew, Yoke Ying</field><field name="description">Thesis (DBA(DoctorateofBusinessAdministration )--University of South Australia, 2004</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Business enterprises, Foreign</field><field name="subject">Consolidation and merger of corporations</field><field name="subject">International business enterprises</field><field name="subject">Organizational behavior</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/80476</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:43875</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding logistics partnerships in Singapore using Lambert's partnership model</field><field name="creator">Chang, Chen Sheng</field><field name="description">In response to the demand for competitive, just-in-time logistics services, the trend continues towards greater outsourcing of supply chain related services and functions to the domain experts. This paper provides a broad-based review of the various aspects of development in a logistics partnering arrangement. Several partnership models and frameworks, along with the characteristics, types, facilitators, advantages, pitfalls and success factors for successful partnerships are analysed. Current results suggest that Lambert et al. (1999)'s partnership model comes closest as a useful guide in developing strategic logistics partnerships. Based on Lambert et al (1999)'s partnership model, empirical research is conducted to identify the key drivers, facilitators and components that affect partnership outcomes between user firms in the electronics and chemicals sectors and and logistics service providers (LSPs) in Singapore. The investigation is further extended to study the relationship dynamics in the use of power versus trust in influencing partnership outcomes.

This work is concerned with implementing a real time, vision based ATR system using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to overcome some of the shortcomings of traditional ATR systems. The key issues of this work are vision, pattern recognition and artificial neural networks. The ANN presented in this thesis is inspired by Prof. Stephen Grossberg's work in Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) and neurophysiological data on the primate brain. An ANN known as Selective Attention Adaptive Resonance Theory (SAART) (Lozo, 1995, 1997) forms the basis of this work. SAART, which is based on Grossberg's ART, models the higher levels of visual processing in the primate brain to provide an ATR system capable of learning and recognising targets in cluttered and complex backgrounds. This thesis contributes an extension to the SAART model to allow a degree of tolerance to imperfections including distortion, changes in size, orientation, or position. In addition to this extension, it is also demonstrated how modulated neural layers can be used for image filtering. A possible extension of the architecture for multi-sensory environments is proposed as a foundation for future research.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Automatic tracking</field><field name="subject">Neural networks (Computer science)</field><field name="subject">Pattern recognition systems</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/82556</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:43297</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Galena flotation : Hellyer Mine case study</field><field name="creator">Greet, Christopher J</field><field name="description">Thesis (PhDApSc(MineralsandMaterials))--University of South Australia, 2002</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Flotation</field><field name="subject">Galena</field><field name="subject">Sphalerite</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/81496</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:43624</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using computer graphics to demonstrate distant relay operation under transient conditions</field><field name="creator">Mwase, Naomi</field><field name="description">Thesis (MEng) -- University of South Australia, 1992</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electric power system stability</field><field name="subject">Electric power systems</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/81106</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:43448</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Channel capacity calculations for M-ary N-dimensional signal sets</field><field name="creator">McIllree, Philip Edward</field><field name="description">Thesis (MEng in Electronic Engineering) -- University of South Australia, 1995</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Signal processing</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/80191</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:43363</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aqueous corrosion and tribological properties of metal matrix composite coatings produced by plasma transferred arc surfacing</field><field name="creator">Deuis, Robert Leslie</field><field name="description">Thesis (PhD (Metallurgical Engineering))--University of South Australia, 1997</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical wear</field><field name="subject">Metal coating</field><field name="subject">Plasma arc welding</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/80086</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:43396</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wideband HF power amplifier modelling for linearisation</field><field name="creator">Urmonas, Richard</field><field name="description">Existing linearisation methods were examined to establish the requirements for a wideband power amplifier model.

materials of dissimilar properties. The amount of charge transferred is dependent on, amongst other things, the contact potential difference between the materials. While a great deal of work has been performed in the past investigating contact electrification, variability in contacts from sample to sample has led to difficulty in providing a fundamental understanding of the process. The investigation here is concerned with surface damage to a plastic component (a spectacle lens), which results from contact electrification. The component in question is cast between two crown glass moulds. After curing, the moulds adhere strongly to the plastic requiring significant leverage to separate them. When separation occurs in the dark, a flash of light is often seen.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polymers</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/84730</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:42583</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The roles of the chemokines CXCL12 and CXCL16 in breast cancer.</field><field name="creator">Hampton-Smith, Sharon</field><field name="description">A growing body of work implicates chemokines and their receptors in the progression of various types of cancer, including breast cancer. However, as potent chemotactic factors for leukocytes, chemokines also have the potential to enhance anti-cancer immunity. Evidence suggests that the chemokine CXCL12 and its receptors may be important in a number of aspects of breast cancer progression and site-specific metastasis. Another chemokine, CXCL16, has been identified as a specific chemotactic factor for Type Ipolarised T lymphocytes, which are major effectors of cell-mediated immunity and hence efficacious anti-tumour immune responses. The aim of this study, therefore, was to further elucidate the roles of CXCL12 and CXCL16 in breast cancer development and metastasis. To achieve this, wild-type CXCL12 and CXCL16 and antagonists of CXCL12 and CXCL16 activity, CXCL12[subscript](P2G) and CXCL16[subscript](9-220) respectively, were overexpressed in the 4T1.2 mouse model of breast carcinoma. Overexpression of wild-type CXCL12 potently inhibited both primary tumour growth and metastasis in this model. This was attributed to the induction of an anti-tumour response dependent, in part, on T cells, interferon-g and the cytotoxic mediators perforin and TRAIL. This response was characterised by increased numbers of CD11c&#8314; cells in the tumour-draining lymph nodes and enhanced cytolytic activity of lymph node-derived effector cells against tumour cells. Unexpectedly, CXCL12[subscript](P2G) inhibited metastasis of tumour cells to the lungs of tumour-bearing mice, without affecting primary tumour growth. Intravenous injection of tumour cells revealed that CXCL12[subscript](P2G) expression could block metastatic steps occurring post tumour cell escape from the primary tumour, though a role for CXCL12([subscript](P2G) at earlier metastatic steps could not be ruled out. Further work is needed to clarify the precise stages of metastasis at which CXCL12[subscript](P2G) exerts its effects. No obvious effects on primary breast tumour growth were observed when CXCL16 or CXCL16([subscript](9-220) were overexpressed in tumour cells. Interestingly, CXCL16[subscript](9-220) expression inhibited experimental metastasis but not spontaneous metastasis. The findings of this study begin to shed light on the roles of CXCL12 and CXCL16 in breast cancer progression and also highlight the potential therapeutic applications of CXCL12, CXCL16 and/or their antagonists in the treatment of breast cancer and breast cancer metastasis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chemokines; breast cancer; CXCL12; CXCL16</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58975</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lyapunov-based control strategies for the global control of symmetric VTOL UAVs.</field><field name="creator">Wood, Rohin</field><field name="description">The last decade has seen significant advances in the development of Vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The emergence of enabling technologies, in addition to the practical usefulness of such systems has driven their development to a point where numerous technology demonstrators and commercial products are now in existence. Of particular interest has been the development of small scale, VTOL UAVs commonly referred to as mini and micro-VTOL UAVs. The versatility and agility of such vehicles offers great potential for the use in clustered, urban environments. Despite recent advancements, the autonomous navigation of VTOL UAVs remains a very challenging research area. The dynamics of VTOL UAVs are heavily nonlinear, underactuated and non-minimum phase. This, coupled with the aggressive maneuvers that such vehicles are expected to execute provides a stimulating problem in dynamic control. This is particularly true in the case of micro-VTOL UAVs. The fast, nonlinear nature of these systems render classical, linear control approaches inadequate. The past twenty years has seen great interest in the development of nonlinear control strategies. This has led to the emergence of a number of standard design tools, most notably feedback linearisation and Lyapunov-based, backstepping approaches. Such design techniques offer a framework for the derivation of model based control laws capable of achieving global stabilisation and trajectory tracking control for heavily nonlinear systems. Recently, there has been significant interest in the application of such nonlinear control paradigms for the stabilisation and control of VTOL UAVs. The aim of this thesis is to further the application and analysis of nonlinear control design techniques for the control of VTOL UAVs. In particular, focus is placed on Lyapunov-based, backstepping-type control approaches. The first half of this thesis investigates Lyapunov-based control strategies that cast the closed-loop VTOL dynamics into a globally stable, cascade structure. This work was directly inspired by, and builds on, a variety of previously published works. Firstly, an alternative design approach to that previously published is presented, resulting in an improved closed-loop dynamic structure. Although inspired by the VTOL system, this idea may be generalised for the control of a broad class of systems, and is presented as such. A singularity issue arising in the cascade control of VTOL vehicles is then investigated, and a novel approach to overcome this issue is formulated. The second half of this thesis is dedicated to the trajectory tracking control of VTOL UAVs at velocities where the influence of aerodynamics is significant. In general, the aerodynamic models of VTOL UAVs are heavily nonlinear and poorly known. The use of such models in a backstepping framework that uses explicit differentiation of these models for dynamic inversion is questioned, due to the potential sensitivity of such nonlinear models. Consequently, an alternative approach utilising coupled filters to avoid such sensitivity issues is proposed. All control designs formulated in this thesis are accompanied by proofs guaranteeing their global stability, and numerical simulations demonstrating their time domain response characteristics.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PVTOL; VTOL; UAV; control; nonlinear; backstepping; lyapunov</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59390</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changing fortunes: the history of China Painting in South Australia.</field><field name="creator">Smith, Avis Carol</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses a gap in research regarding South Australian china painting. Although china painting has been practised in Australia for the last 120 years and is held in major Australian collections, it has been little researched and then in a minor role associated with ceramics and studio potters, or as women&#8217;s art/craft. The china painters too, have been little researched. My research identifies the three &#8216;highs&#8217; of the changing fortunes of china painting, and how the practice survived in between. I argue that it was first taught in the city&#8217;s School of Design, Painting and Technical Art in 1894 as a skill for possible industrial employment, due to the initiative of School Principal, Harry Pelling Gill. However china painting classes were discontinued by 1897 due to an economic depression and the fact that the anticipated industry did not eventuate. In 1906 china painting classes were reinstituted in the (re-named) Adelaide School of Art and teacher Laurence Howie was pivotal in that revival. China painting classes ceased during the First World War while Howie served overseas in the Australian Forces, but resumed in 1923 after his return and appointment as Principal of the (renamed) School of Arts and Crafts. The resulting change in the fortunes of china painting was the outcome of the School&#8217;s appropriate training in art and design, and I argue this enabled emerging professional female artists to confidently exhibit china painting alongside their fine art. I will devote a chapter to the important role of the South Australian Society of Arts in facilitating this important public exposure of china painting. The Second World War marked a decline in popularity of china painting. Chapter 5 traces its survival till it burst into popularity again in 1965. Further chapters describe china painting&#8217;s following meteoric rise in fortune and the role played by the South Australian teachers of the art/craft, few of whom had received formal art training. I argue that china painting became a conservative social craft, but nonetheless a serious hobby, pursued by married, middle-class women who strongly believed their work was art, not craft. I will point out how they were visited and influenced by entrepreneurial American teachers, politically active in the art/craft debate in the United States of America. Chapter 8 will chart the steps taken by Australian teachers in the 1980s to break from the American influence and regain an Australian identity in teachers&#8217; organisations and iconography. I will describe the debates that ensued following experimental work exhibited by avant-garde Australian teachers to resolve the art/craft debate regarding china painting in Australia, and the difficulties of maintaining china painting momentum as the majority of practitioners became elderly women. This thesis identifies education of the practitioners as a key factor throughout South Australian china painting history as a way of better understanding the place of china painting within the decorative arts. China painting is currently in decline; nevertheless, as I will point out in my conclusion, there are several future pathways it could take. Only within recent decades have curators and writers shown an increased interest in women&#8217;s decorative arts, including china painting. It is timely to undertake research before existing documentation of china painting is lost.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">South Australia; china painting; women artists; South Australian school of art; Royal South Australian society of arts; hobbyists</field><field name="subject">China painting South Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59391</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulatory T cells, Th17 effector cells and cytokine microenvironment in inflammatory bowel disease and coeliac disease.</field><field name="creator">Eastaff-Leung, Nicola</field><field name="description">Inflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn&#8217;s disease and ulcerative colitis) and coeliac disease are debilitating gastrointestinal diseases that seriously affect the quality of life of those affected. Under normal circumstances, the intestinal immune system is maintained in a state of controlled inflammation, whereby balance exists between protective immunity, mediated by effector cells, and tolerance mediated by cells with regulatory function. However, an aberrant immune response is believed to contribute to the intestinal inflammation present in individuals afflicted by these diseases. This thesis investigated the involvement of CD4&#8314; CD25[superscript]high Foxp3&#8314; Regulatory T cells (Treg) and Th17 Effector cells in both inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and coeliac disease. The reciprocal relationship between Treg and Th17 cells under certain cytokine conditions, has prompted the exploration of these two cell types in IBD and coeliac disease. Previous studies have examined these factors individually in a range of diseases, however, to our knowledge the study of both Treg and Th17 in IBD and coeliac disease subjects represents a novel area of research. Crohn&#8217;s disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and coeliac disease subjects were recruited through the Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at The Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QEH) in Adelaide, South Australia. In total, one-hundred and seventeen subjects were enlisted in this study to donate blood samples. In addtion, intestinal biopsy samples were collected from fifty-six subjects undergoing colonoscopy at the QEH Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology. All subjects participated, with informed consent and ethics approval. Treg and Th17 cell numbers were investigated in the peripheral blood of Crohn&#8217;s disease, ulcerative colitis, coeliac disease and control subjects using multi-colour, intracellular flow cytometry. A decrease in Treg cell numbers and an increase in Th17 cell numbers was observed in IBD, but not in coeliac disease. Closer investigation into the ratio of Treg and Th17 cells within patients identified a near 1:1 Treg/Th17 ratio in control subjects, but a lower Treg/Th17 ratio in IBD patients. This suggested a disturbance in regulatory and effector cell equilibrium. Furthermore, the excess of Th17 cells and deficiency of Tregs could contribute to the pathologies observed in IBD. The discovery of an imbalance in Treg and Th17 cell numbers in IBD prompted further investigation of these cells in intestinal biopsies collected from IBD, coeliac and control subjects. Real time RT-PCR of intestinal biopsy samples demonstrated increased expression of the Th17 cytokine, IL-17a, in both IBD and coeliac disease. Elevated levels of the Treg transcription factor Foxp3 were also identified in intestinal biopsies from IBD subjects. It was therefore hypothesised that Treg cells may have been actively recruited from the periphery in an attempt to control inflammation in the gut; however, the intestinal cytokine microenvironment may have restricted the regulatory function of these cells. Cytokines known to promote human Th17 differentiation, namely IL-1&#946;, IL-6, TGF-&#946;, IL-21 and IL-23, were explored in intestinal biopsy samples from IBD, coeliac and control subjects. High levels of IL-1&#946; and IL-6 were detected in IBD patient samples, however, no change in levels of IL-21 or IL-23 were observed in IBD or coeliac disease subjects. Elevated levels of TGF-&#946; were only identified in UC. No changes in cytokine expression were observed between control and coeliac subjects, except a significant decrease in IL-6 levels was identified in coeliac disease sufferers. The pro-inflammatory microenvironment identified in intestinal biopsies from IBD subjects may have promoted the continual differentiation and development of Th17 cells, whilst restricting Treg activity. Moreover, the observed deficiency of Treg in IBD patients may have impaired the ability of the immune system to limit excessive pathogenic Th17 driven immune responses in the intestinal mucosa. Therefore, therapeutic approaches that aim to re-establish regulatory and effector cell homeostasis by increasing Treg numbers in IBD patients, and specifically targeting Th17 cells, may prove effective in the treatment of IBD. Approaches such as these could provide greater focus to treatment strategies for IBD management compared to current broad-spectrum immunosuppressive therapies that could increase susceptibility to cancer or infection in IBD patients. In addition, the imbalance of regulatory and effector cells demonstrated in the peripheral blood of IBD patients may potentially provide new options for a noninvasive diagnostic tool.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">regulatory T cells; Th17 effector cells; imflammatory bowel disease; coeliac disease</field><field name="subject">T cells</field><field name="subject">Inflammatory bowel diseases</field><field name="subject">Crohn's disease.</field><field name="subject">Celiac disease.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59392</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamics of plant residue decomposition and nutrient release.</field><field name="creator">Duong, Tra Thi Thanh.</field><field name="description">Proper management of soil organic matter (SOM) contributes to increasing plant productivity and reducing dependency on mineral fertilizers. Organic matter is widely regarded as a vital component of a healthy soil as it plays an important role in soil physical, chemical and biological fertility. Plant residues are the primary source of SOM. Therefore, proper SOM management requires a better understanding of plant residue decomposition kinetics in order to synchronize nutrient release during decomposition and plant uptake and prevent nutrient losses. In natural and managed ecosystems, residues are added frequently to soil, in the form of dead roots and litter fall of plant species with different C/N ratios. However, in most studies on residue decomposition, residues with different C/N ratios are added once and the effect of the presence of plants on residue decomposition is rarely investigated. In this project, four experiments were carried out with different objectives in order to close these knowledge gaps. The aim of the first experiment was to investigate the effect of frequent wheat residue addition on C mineralization and N dynamics. The experiment consisted of five treatments with different frequency of residue addition (2% w/w of wheat residues in total): once (100%W), every 16 days (25%), every 8 days (12.5%) or every 4 days (6.25%) and noresidue addition (control) with four replicates. The results showed that increasing frequency of low-N wheat residue addition increased C mineralization. Compared to 100%W, cumulative respiration per g residue at the end of the incubation (day 80) was increased by 57, 82 and 92% at 25%W, 12.5%W and 6.25%W, respectively. Despite large increases in cumulative respiration, frequent residue addition did not affect inorganic N or available N concentrations, microbial biomass C and N or soil pH. It is concluded that experiments with single residue additions may underestimate residue decomposition rates in the field because with several additions, soil microbes respire more of the added C (and possibly native soil C) per unit biomass but that this does not change their N requirements or the microbial community composition. In the second experiment, the effect of mixing of high and low C/N residues at different times during incubation was investigated. There were 4 addition times; 25% of a total of 2% (w/w) residue was added either as wheat (high C/N) or lupin (low C/N) residue. Wheat residue was added to lupin residues on days 16 (LW-16), 32 (LW-32) or 48 (LW-48). Additional treatments were 100%L (added 25% of lupin residues on days 0, 16, 32 and 48) and 100%W (added 25% of wheat residues on days 0, 16, 32 and 48) and 0% (the control) with four replicates. Adding high C/N residues into decomposing low C/N ratio residue strongly decreased the respiration rate compared to the addition of low C/N residues, and lowered the availability of inorganic N, but significantly increased soil pH and altered microbial community composition. By the end of the incubation on day 64, the cumulative respiration of LW-16, LW-32 and LW-48 was similar and approximately 30% lower than in the treatment with only lupin residue addition. The third experiment studied the effect of spatial separation of high and low C/N residues on decomposition and N mineralization. Each microcosm consisted of two PVC caps of 70 mm diameter and 20 mm height with the open end facing each other separated by a 30&#956;m mesh. The caps were filled with soil mixed with either low or high C/N residue with three replicates. Contact of high and low C/N residues led to an increase in the decomposition rate of the high C/N residues at the interface whereas it decreased it in the low C/N residues. The results showed that N and soluble C compounds moved from the easily decomposable residues into the surrounding soil, thereby enhancing microbial activity, increasing inorganic N and significantly changing soil pH in the layer 0-5 mm from the interface compared to the 5-10 mm layer of the high C/N residues, whereas the movement of soluble C and N to high C/N residues decreased the decomposition of the low C/N residues. The final experiment investigated the effect of living plants on decomposition of high and low C/N residues. Wheat was grown in pots with a 30 &#956;m mesh at the bottom. After a root mat had formed (&gt;50% root coverage), a PVC cap with soil with high and low C/N residues (2% w/w) was placed against the mesh. The presence of plant roots significantly increased the respiration rate, N immobilization and increased the soil pH in the 0-5 mm layer in the first 4 days compared to the 5-10 mm layer. This enhanced microbial activity (and probably microbial biomass) can be explained by root exudates. The microbial community composition of plant treatments differed significantly from treatments without plants and the effect was greater in the immediate vicinity of the roots.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">plant residue decomposition; C-mineralisation; N-mineralisation; nutrient release; microbial community composition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59393</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Totara Valley micro-hydro development : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Renewable Energy Engineering, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, David Ronald</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the design, construction and operation of a distributed generation system based on micro-hydro technology. The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Tu'i Kanokupolu Matai establishment and why would Tu'i Tonga Fuanunuiava have vied to become one? : a genealogical analysis of post 1550 AD new political hegemony in Tonga</field><field name="creator">'Ilaiu, Siaosi L.</field><field name="description">This work examines some issues relating to specific social, political and ideological developments that have shaped the pre-contact history of Tonga especially the puzzling ideas that revolve around the co-existence of the three kingly lines that survived into the era of written record. There are competing versions of how each dynasty came about and what kinds of contribution they accomplished. I endeavour to go further than what current research has brought to light so far. In fact, current research on Tongan history is stagnant due to some great lack in research methodology whereby easy problems cannot be logically deciphered. I believe this is because present disciplinary guidelines limit the scope for attaining a deep understanding of things not to mention the failure of comparative method (comparing chronologies in neighbouring islands) to underpin the historical realities on offer. One of my main concerns in this study rests on how well the contact period reflects the reality of what we may refer to as Tongan tradition or what is really traditional about Tongan ways of life prior to the seventeenth century. This thesis is designed to use Tongan genealogy as a guide in attempting to make sense of what the European records can offer to our understanding of post-contact Tonga. Historical documentation in this context refers simply to post-contact recording of events, whereas traditional history, ordered by genealogy, gives us access to a more distant past. This work argues further that genealogy unravels an ever-presence of conflicting tendencies that existed even in times where Tongan society was perceived to enjoy long-term peace. This thesis is aimed at a complete rethinking of political transformations in ancient Tongan polity and how such transformations introduced new patterns of social, political and ideological realities that current scholars have not yet recognised. I also show how genealogy is useful in determining the course of Tongan political history, especially the major changes that took place a few centuries before contact with Europe came about in the early 17th century AD. In Chapter one, I introduce an alternative theory about the political history of Tonga since the inception of the TK dynasty1. I also delineate how genealogy reflects major changes in all aspects of life in both pre- contact and post-contact Tonga. In the light of this better understanding of Tongan political history I employ Antonio Gramci&#8217;s dialectic to harness and clarify matters relating to social processes in the past that have remained unexplained up to now. I discuss here the hegemony of the Tu&#8217;i Tonga dynasty i.e. how it was achieved and maintained for over a thousand years from 450 AD until around 1500 AD when there was an unsuccessful counter-hegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua line. In 1550 shortly after the Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua failure every commentator of Tongan society has overlooked another counter hegemony by the third dynasty. The Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu hegemony will be critically discussed with reference to a further counterhegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Tonga by which strategy the old dynasty managed to survive a bit longer. Chapter 2 then, offers a critique of old notions about Tongan society in works written mostly by the socalled Polynesianist revisionists who have constantly revisited Tongan history for the past two decades. I also show why Tongan traditionalists and scholars alike could not understand what had been happening in Tonga&#8217;s past. This work focuses on the creation of the third dynasty in Tonga around 1550 AD. There are a number of issues relating to this event that have not been discussed by any commentator of Tongan society so far. These include the indirect but significant importation of a quasi-Samoan matai system that eventually formed the basis of Tongan polity encountered by European explorers starting from Souten and Le Maire in 1616 during the reign of the third Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu (Mataeletu&#8217;apiko), when the matai system was locally practised in the narrow confines of Hihifo2. It had gained momentum at the time of Captain Cook&#8217;s last visit in 1777. The system grew stronger and spread to all corners of the Tongan archipelago within the duration of only two centuries. It is the growth of this system that this study determines to underpin, as it will provide a more lucid explanation for a number of important puzzles that still confuse contemporary historians. First, the reason why and how the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu came into existence, the odd nature of Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political practices, and the secrets behind the mass production of titles as family and extended family gifts plus how these gifts determined the outcome of social, political, and religious activities that all three dynasties engaged in, in their tensely unavoidable coexistence especially in the eighteenth century. Chapter 3 - offers a general discussion of Ama&#8217;s possible schemes and plots. I argue in this part that Ama was determined to recapture and rule Safata. In Samoa I identify a connection between a political struggle (civil war) that took place in Upolu around 1500 &#8211; 1520 AD with the creation of the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu in Tonga about 1550 AD. This war is discussed here for two reasons. First, it was an attempt by Samoan high chiefs to create a centralised in Upolu state to be headed by a Samoan monarch for the first time in their history. Second, the end result of this war affected Tonga more than Samoa since the vanquished Ama fled from his district Safata to Tonga. This chapter concentrates on discussing the major players in the said war. Chapter 4 &#8211; This part discusses Samoan politics at the time of Ama&#8217;s exile. I also unfold here the structure of Samoan polity by discussing the matai system and how it generates political, social and religious responsibilities among Samoan lives in general. This chapter discusses significant principles of Samoan social and political organisation such as matai (title system), tafa&#8217;i (royal protector), faleupolu (political advisors), &#8216;aiga (extended family), sa (family &#8211; royal lines), ali&#8217;i-pa&#8217;ia (sacred chief/district monarch), ali&#8217;i (high chief), tulafale-ali&#8217;i (minor chief), and tulafale (chief&#8217;s attendant). These organisations will be compared with the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political system so that the resemblance is not confused with the Tu&#8217;i Tonga and Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua systems. Chapter 5 - discusses with critical analyses the real characters of the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political establishment. Such discussion includes TK status, the conception of &#8216;ulutolu (chief&#8217;s protector), hingoa &#8211; fakanofo (title system), falekanokupolu (political advisors), kainga (extended family), ha&#8217;a (titled chiefs related to an original royal line), &#8216;eiki lahi (paramount chief), eiki (high chief), &#8216;eiki si&#8217;i (minor chief), matapule (chief&#8217;s attendant). I argue in this part, that the TK political organisation is essentially structured in Samoan fashion both in theory and in practice and I will show the basic difference between this system and the quintessential Tu&#8217;i Tonga organisational principles described in the next chapter. Chapter 6 &#8211; This chapter depicts the basic structure of the Tu&#8217;i Tonga political organisation and how it countered the powerful hegemony of the TK expansion in the 17th and 18th centuries when there was an internal struggle for political supremacy among the three ruling dynasties. I discuss here counter hegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Tonga, which resulted in the creation of several new statuses such as the Tu&#8217;i Tonga fefine (female Tu&#8217;i Tonga), tamaha (sacred being &#8211; female), falefisi (sacred house of Fiji). This chapter also highlights the collision between the old political system and the new and also shows how the new system paved its way to an undisputed status in the mid 19th century after the last conflict of 1852. I discuss the new Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu ha&#8217;a system and the kind of impact it propagated in the dominions of Tu&#8217;i Tonga and Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua. Chapter 7 &#8211; My main concern in this chapter rests on a case where a highborn female Tupou moheofo successfully usurped the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu title and became the first female titleholder in this dynasty. She was very ambitious and pried into politics on a number of occasions when she made attempts to revolutionise the norm of Tongan tradition such as her well known move to dethrone her husband Tu&#8217;i Tonga Pau in favour of their son Fuanunuiava and also her desperate instigation to abolish the office of the TK in the 1770s. Chapter 8 &#8211; Discusses how TT Fuanunuiava aspired to obtain political authority and his strange ambition to be named Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu after the death of TK Mumui in 1798. Why should a Tu&#8217;i Tonga vie to be named TK will be discussed here in great detail.

This cyclic pattern may represent a natural frequency at varying timescales in the growth dynamics of stratovolcanoes, but is often difficult to identify because of long cycle-timescales, coupled with incomplete stratigraphic records. The volcaniclastic ring-plain succession surrounding the 2 518 m Mt. Taranaki, New Zealand, comprises a wide variety of distinctive volcanic mass-flow lithofacies with sedimentary and lithology characteristics that can be related to recurring volcanic cycles over &gt;190 ka. Debrisflow and monolithologic hyperconcentrated-flow deposits record edifice growth phases while polylithologic debris-avalanche and associated cohesive debris-flow units were emplaced by collapse. Major edifice failures at Mt. Taranaki occurred on-average every 10 ka, with five events recognised over the last 30 ka, a time interval for which stratigraphic records are more complete. The unstable nature of Mt. Taranaki mainly results from its weak internal composite structure including abundant saturated pyroclastic deposits and breccia layers, along with its growth on a weakly indurated and tectonically fractured basement of Tertiary mudstones and sandstones. As the edifice repeatedly grew beyond a critical stable height or profile, large-scale collapses were triggered by intrusions preceding magmatic activity, major eruptions, or significant regional tectonic fault movements. Clasts within debris-avalanche deposits were used as a series of windows into the composition of previous successive proto-Mt Taranaki edifices in order to examine magmatic controls on their failure. The diversity of lithologies and their geochemical characteristics are similar throughout the history of the volcano, with the oldest sample suites displaying a slightly broader range of compositions including more primitive rock types. The evolution to a narrower range and higher-silica compositions was accompanied by an increase in K2O. This shows that later melts progressively interacted with underplated amphibolitic material at the base of the crust. These gradual changes imply a long-term stability of the magmatic system. The preservation of similar internal conditions during the volcano&#8217;s evolution, hence suggests that external processes were the main driving force behind its cyclic growth and collapse behaviour and resulting sedimentation pattern.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vulcanology</field><field name="subject">Mount Taranaki</field><field name="subject">Mount Egmont</field><field name="subject">volcanoes</field><field name="subject">stratigraphic geology</field><field name="subject">geochemistry</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology::260103 Vulcanology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/900</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spinning in my mother's garden : a search for subjectivity : an exegesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Fine Arts at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Walker, Justine</field><field name="description">Appendix C contains video files which were unable to be uploaded onto the institutional repository, but are available with the hard copy of the thesis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Subjectivity</field><field name="subject">Feminism</field><field name="subject">Patriarchal systems</field><field name="subject">Differance</field><field name="subject">Luce Irigaray</field><field name="subject">Julia Kristeva</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1436</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Revegetation of recent soil slips in Manawatu : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master in Applied Science at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Prasad, Kamal Kishor</field><field name="description">Trifolium repens, Lotus pedunculatus and Holcus lanatus were oversown on two recent soil slip surfaces at AgResearch&#8217;s Ballantrae pastoral hill&#8208;country farm near Woodville. The two slip surfaces were located on (Manamahu steepland soil) sedimentary mudstone. One slip had a north aspect and the other had a south aspect. Both slips were located on a land class 6 with slope 28&#8208;330. The pasture species were oversown during early spring and the percentage seedling emergence and early establishment from viable seeds oversown was analysed at early spring (Day 15), late spring (Day 45), early summer (Day 90), and late summer (Day 120). The slip surfaces showed micro&#8208;climatic extremes in terms of both soil moisture and surface temperatures during the summer period. Significant differences (P &lt; 0.05) were found in soil moisture between north and south facing slip surfaces. Higher soil moisture and lower soil mean temperature were recorded on the south aspect slip surface. Significant differences (P &lt; 0.05) were found between the three pasture species in terms of seedling emergence and early establishment. Significant differences (P &lt; 0.05) were also found with aspect. The south aspect slip surface had a higher percentage of seedling emergence and earlier establishment for all the species. Interaction between species by aspect became significantly different (P &lt; 0.05) at Day 90 and Day 120. The main effects of time and species were also significantly different (P &lt; 0.05) illustrating seedling emergence and establishment as a race against time. Trifolium repens was a more successful pasture specie, than L. pedunculatus and H. lanatus due to its higher consistency on both north and south slip surfaces. Oversowing T. repens during early spring is a viable option for rehabilitation of recent soil slips in Manawatu.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Revegetation</field><field name="subject">Landslides</field><field name="subject">Erosion</field><field name="subject">Soil erosion</field><field name="subject">Soil stabilisation</field><field name="subject">Pasture</field><field name="subject">Pastoral hill country</field><field name="subject">Trifolium repens</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300104 Land capability and soil degradation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1435</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adoption of precision agriculture technologies for fertiliser placement in New Zealand : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements of the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Agricultural Engineering at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lawrence, Hayden George</field><field name="description">Major agronomic and economic losses are caused by inaccurate application of nutrients from ground based spreading vehicles. These losses come from both over and under application of fertiliser resulting from such practices as driving at inappropriate bout widths. This work reviewed current spreader testing procedures; compared the performance of international test methodologies and evaluated the use of a digital image processing program to perform spreader testing. Methods to evaluate field performance were developed; this analysis of field application was used to calculate the economic effect of using precision agricultural technologies in New Zealand dairy farming systems. A matrix of fourteen hundred 0.5 x 0.5 m fertiliser collection trays was used to evaluate individual test methodologies. Results indicated that there were major variations in calculated certifiable bout width between different methods and direct comparison should be avoided. Tray layout within &#177; 5 m of the centre spread line had the largest effect on calculated bout width whilst methods that incorporated rows of trays in the longitudinal direction were less variable compared to those using a single transverse test. The probability too accurately assign bout widths using different international test methods was analysed, the ACCU Spread (Australia) test method had the highest level of confidence in its bout width calculation followed by the ES (Europe) test method. The ISO(i) (World), ISO(ii) (World) and Spreadmark (NZ) tests were all found to be comparable to one another whilst the ASAE (USA) method had the lowest level of confidence in its bout width calculation because of wide collector tray spacing. A method to extract a wider range of data from spreader tests using a hybrid image processing system was developed. Results indicated that there was a strong relationship between two dimensional particle area and particle mass under laboratory (R2 = 0.991) and field (R2 = 0.988) conditions. Although transverse spreader tests provided a good indication of machine performance, they did not account for the interaction of the spreader and its operational environment. A method was developed that used the vehicle location during field application and the transverse spread pattern represented as polygons to create field application maps. Initial results showed large variations compared to the measured transverse spread pattern. A wider study over 102 paddocks on four dairy farms showed that average variation was 37.9%. An improvement to the field application method discussed is given; this tool used the geographical position, heading angle and a series of static spread pattern tests from the spreading vehicle to achieve greater accuracy in field measurements. The described field application methods were used to assess the ability to execute a nutrient plan using both actual and optimised spreading data collected during field application. A loss of $66.18 ha-1 was calculated when comparing the efficiency of using current spreading methods to those assumed in nutrient budgeting practice. If a guidance and control system were used correctly to provide optimised field application the loss could be reduced to $46.41 ha-1. This work highlighted the difficulties in achieving accurate field nutrient application; however, by developing the ability to quantify field performance, economic opportunities could be evaluated. Overall, this work found that there was a strong agronomic and economic case for the implementation of precision agricultural technologies in the New Zealand fertiliser industry. However, the current range of equipment used by the spreading industry would have difficulty in delivering these benefits.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fertiliser application</field><field name="subject">Fertiliser equipment</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::299900 Other Engineering and Technology::299901 Agricultural engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1429</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of durable textile-conductive polymer composites : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Ph. D. in Chemistry at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Collie, Stewart Roger</field><field name="description">The research described in this thesis investigated a range of techniques for the in situ polymerisation of thiophene-based intrinsically conductive polymers (ICPs) on textile substrates. Following a review of the literature, three potentially useful techniques were identified; a simple aqueous technique; a vapour phase technique; and a two-stage impregnation technique. The literature also indicated that thiophene-based ICPs were likely to be more durable than those prepared from other precursors. The aqueous technique proved unsuccessful, but both the vapour and two-stage impregnation techniques were used to prepare textile-ICP composites using 2,2'-bithiophene and 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT). Polymerisation was effected by chemical oxidation of the precursor, with iron (III) salts being the best oxidants. The main drawbacks of the vapour system were the long vapour exposure times (e.g. several days) and/or elevated temperatures required to polymerise these relatively unreactive precursors. Two-stage impregnation was somewhat messy and inefficient, so a novel refinement of the technique (referred to as 'single dip') was developed. With this system, the specimen was impregnated with both precursor and oxidant from a single solution, then removed from the solution and the solvent allowed to evaporate. It was only at this stage that polymerisation occurred, and when more reactive ICP precursors (such as pyrrole) were used, polymerisation tended to occur in solution, and was less effective. The influence of various treatment parameters was established, while tests confirmed that the deposited ICP layer had no detrimental effect on the desirable fabric properties of flexibility and strength. Composites with surface resistance as low as 65 &#937;/square were prepared with less than 6% ICP load on the textile (perchlorate-doped poly(EDOT)). The durability of poly(EDOT) composites was far better than polypyrrole under ageing in ambient conditions, accelerated ageing at elevated temperatures, and when given a treatment that simulated laundering. Finally, a scheme for continuously depositing ICPs onto textiles by this approach was designed, as a way of demonstrating the potential for scale-up of the system.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Smart textiles</field><field name="subject">Polymerisation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250100 Physical Chemistry (Incl.

However, researchers have largely dismissed the concept as a romantic but unworkable idea. Nonetheless in the short history of education in Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ), notions of integration have persistently reappeared in the national curriculum. In the 1930s, innovative teachers implemented world-class examples of curriculum integration in rural schools. Later, the Freyberg Project (1986-1991) demonstrated that curriculum integration admirably meets the needs of young people. Recently, the Ministry of Education trialled curriculum integration in several schools but, since the literature indicates that curriculum integration is represented by a plethora of models, this raised an important question: which model is preferable? This thesis combines historical and theoretical methodology to conduct an investigation of the concept of curriculum integration with respect to the needs of early adolescents in NZ. The historical investigation demonstrates that curriculum integration is best described by two broad traditions which stem from nineteenth century USA: the 'student-centred' approach based on Dewey's 'organic' education and the 'subject-centred' approach based on the Herbartian notion of 'correlation'. These two approaches are represented in current practice by the student-centred integrative model (Beane, 1990/1993) and the subject-centred multidisciplinary model (Jacobs, 1989). The theoretical investigation draws from American experience to examine the respective claims of the integrative and multidisciplinary models as the preferred model of curriculum integration for middle schooling. It finds that the 'thick' ethics associated with the politics of the integrative model ensures that it meets the needs of all early adolescents whereas the 'thin' ethics of the multidisciplinary model is indifferent to the needs of young people. The thesis concludes that the integrative model should be seriously considered in the middle years in NZ. It also concludes that historical understandings of curriculum integration are vital to further research, policy-making and teacher education. Moreover, attention to political and ethical issues would enhance implementation of the integrative model in NZ and would help avoid a set of problems which have impeded implementation of the model in the USA.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Curriculum</field><field name="subject">Interdisciplinary education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330200 Curriculum Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1431</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancing positive work relationships and the school environment : an exploratory case study of teachers' emotions : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Yee, Sarah Anne</field><field name="description">The experience of work life is saturated with feelings or emotions (Ashforth &amp; Humphrey, 1995). For humans, as with any social animals, our survival and day to day functioning rely heavily on the communication and perception of emotions (Ashkanasy, H&#228;rtel, &amp; Zerbe, 2000b). When attention is paid to increasing awareness and understanding of emotion in our work lives, and how those emotions affect others, there is potential to improve interpersonal interactions and develop more positive, supportive work relationships. The work environment is largely dependent on the quality of these relationships and connections between organisational members (Carmeli, 2009). Despite the centrality of work relationships within organisations, researchers are yet to fully understand the dynamics and the processes that nurture and sustain positive interpersonal relationships at work (Ragins &amp; Dutton, 2007). Collegial relationships are particularly important in organisations such as schools, where the way that staff interact with one another not only affects their job performance and the quality of their work life, but also the lives and learning abilities of their students. The purpose of this study was to gain a deeper understanding how collegial interactions, relationships, and the school environment may change when staff are trained in emotional skills. This research was a smaller, parallel study contributing to a larger three year project &#8211; Te Aniwaniwa: Warming up the Classroom Emotional Environment. A mixed method approach utilised quantitative information from questionnaires to assess the school environment and morale, and qualitative information from weekly diaries of emotional interactions and semi-structured interviews. All of the teaching and support staff from a local primary school attended workshops to enhance their emotional skills based on the Harvey-Evans (2003) model of the classroom emotional environment. Although statistical analyses were not sensitive enough to detect changes in quantitative data from questionnaires due to a small sample size (N=18), qualitative information collected from weekly diaries and interviews suggested that staff were noticing changes to their day to day interactions with one another and improvements to their professional relationships. Interview themes highlighted some of the day to day behaviours and expectations that may be important in laying solid foundations on which positive relationships can be built. By delivering training to individuals within School A to enhance their emotional skills, this programme encouraging the development of an atmosphere where emotions could be expressed, understood and managed more effectively. The implications of these results are not necessarily restricted to management and staff relationships in schools but may also be extended to other occupational settings where individuals are required to support one another and share ideas and resources.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organisational psychology</field><field name="subject">Interpersonal relationships</field><field name="subject">Teachers</field><field name="subject">Emotions</field><field name="subject">Emotional skills</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380108 Industrial and organisational psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1432</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Does mutual fund investment style consistency affect the performance of mutual funds? : evidence from Chinese mutual funds</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Yi</field><field name="description">While much of the previous research on mutual funds has concentrated on finding the relationship between the investment style, the past performance and the future performance of funds, very few of the studies have paid attention to the effect of a mutual fund manager&#8217;s execution of investment style on fund returns. Using return-based analysis methodologies for measuring the style consistency of Chinese mutual funds, this thesis demonstrates that the less style-consistent funds tend to produce higher future risk-adjusted returns than more consistent mutual funds, even after controlling for past performance and net asset value (NAV). Further, these findings are robust across mutual fund investment style classifications, test period intervals (one-year or one-quarter interval), and the model used to calculate the expected returns (four-factor model and Sharpe&#8217;s style analysis model). This thesis also documents the performance-persistency effects that exist in Chinese mutual funds, which remain persistent even under the condition of style consistency. More importantly, the research discovered that at a time of change in the Chinese stock market, the negative correlation between style consistency and future performance becomes weaker. The study concludes that style consistency does matter for mutual funds&#8217; future risk-adjusted returns and that there is a significant negative correlation with mutual funds&#8217; future risk-adjusted performance in the longer term (i.e., over the entire test period). Moreover, this connection is distinct from those related to the past risk-adjusted performance and NAV of mutual funds. It is also clear that a significant negative correlation between style consistency and the future risk-adjusted return does exist in Chinese stock and asset allocation mutual funds, even after adjusting for the investment style of the fund. Finally, this thesis provide a mutual funds picking strategy for investors base on the main findings of this study, which can provide significant positive alpha at each year during the test period.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mutal fund investment style</field><field name="subject">Investments</field><field name="subject">Finance</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Mutual funds</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350300 Banking, Finance and Investment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1433</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Holistic professional military development : growing strategic artists : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Education at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Simons, Murray Vaughan</field><field name="description">Professional military education is a well&#8208;established system in most modern militaries. Like all things though, incremental and ad hoc improvements to legacy approaches typically lead to reduced quality. It is therefore, essential to periodically review the entire system for holistic effectiveness. For military education, this need is particularly important when the global security environment is experiencing such rapid change. Added to this is the emerging understanding of the &#8216;new sciences&#8217; that provides a unique opportunity to improve cognitive agility when confronting complex adaptive systems. There is also an urgent need to acknowledge and enhance the intangible dimension of professional military education beyond mere content&#8208;centric subject expertise. From the literature on hidden learning and constructivism, there are a number of opportunities available for modernizing the legacy paradigm of professional military education. This study investigated the role of holistic learning (formal, non&#8208;formal, informal, selfdirected, and incidental learning) in the professional development of 29 mid&#8208;career military officers. It involved detailed study of their participation on the seven&#8208;month staff course at the New Zealand Defence College from May to December 2008. Mixed methodology data collection included observations, interviews, questionnaires, focus groups, and document analysis. Analytic procedures ranged from statistical comparisons through to qualitative theme constructs. The study found a number of dimensions (sources and influences) contributing to holistic learning. It also identified a number of opportunities to improve the learning experience. The findings identify a number of important factors in developing strategic artists. Of these, the greatest need is for a strategic plan to extend the current content&#8208;centric syllabus into a full curriculum with intangible traits clearly linked to formal and informal learning activities. Specific components required in this strategic plan include an academic philosophy and a cross&#8208;referencing matrix. The study also recommends reviewing time allocated to cross&#8208;discipline learning of the profession and cognitive agility focused on deep learning. There is also a need to re&#8208;examine the directing staff requirements, management of learner stress, and shaping practical&#8208;value motivation strategies through cultural artefacts.

The aim was to gain insight into the Auslan-English language contact outcomes that might be found in these settings, and what factors influenced these outcomes. The results indicated that the most unique use of language by deaf bilinguals was that of simultaneous use of both spoken English and Auslan, and it was this simultaneous use which facilitated the two examples of code-switching (defined as a complete change of language from Auslan to spoken English) that was found in the data. The other two contact outcomes of significance were frequent transference of English into Auslan, and the equally frequent use of fingerspelling, which has a pivotal role in filling the gap in Auslan, a language with no orthographic form. The study also revealed that Auslan (a signed language) was the language in which many issues of identity were expressed by deaf bilinguals, regardless of whether the individual was a first or second language learner of Auslan. The results confirmed that these language and identity factors did influence the language contact outcomes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Auslan bilingualism, sign language/spoken language, sign/spoken language and code-switching, sign/spoken language bilingualism, deaf adult bilinguals</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/8521</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Introgression of genes from rape to wild turnip</field><field name="creator">Jenkins, Toni E.</field><field name="description">Introgression of genes from crops into ruderal populations is a multi-step process requiring sympatry, synchronous flowering, chromosomal compatibility, successful pollination and development of the zygote, germination, establishment and reproduction of hybrid progeny. The goal of this thesis was to generate data on as many steps in this process as possible and integrate them into a predictive statistical model to estimate the likelihood of successful introgression under a range of scenarios. Rape (Brassica napus) and wild turnip (B. rapa var. oleifera) were used as a model system. A homozygous dominant mutation in the rape genome conferring herbicide resistance provided a convenient marker for the study of introgression. Potential differences between wild turnip populations from a wide range of geographic locations in New Zealand were examined.  Hand pollination established the genetic compatibility of rape and wild turnip and a high potential for gene introgression from rape to wild turnip. Interspecific hybrids were easily generated using wild turnip as the maternal plant, with some minor differences between wild turnip populations. The frequency of successful hybridisation between the two species was higher on the lower raceme. However, the upper raceme produced more dormant interspecific hybrid seed.  Field trials, designed to imitate rare rape crop escapes into the ruderal environment, examined the ability of rare rape plants to pollinate wild turnip plants over four summers. At a ratio of 1 rape plant for every 400 wild turnip plants, the incidence of interspecific hybridisation was consistently low (&lt;0.1 to 2.1 % of total seed on wild turnip plants). There was a significant year effect with the first season producing significantly more seed and a greater frequency of interspecific hybrid progeny than the other years. The frequency of interspecific hybrid progeny increases when the ratio of rape: wild turnip plant numbers increases.  The relative importance of anemophily and entomophily in the production of interspecific hybrids was examined. Wild turnip plants produced twice as many seeds with bee pollination relative to wind pollination. However, the frequency of interspecific hybrids under wind pollination was nearly twice that for bee pollination. Light reflectance patterns under UV light revealed a marked difference between wild turnip and rape flowers compared to near identical appearance under visible light. The data indicates that bees are able to distinguish between rape and wild turnip flowers and exhibit floral constancy when foraging among populations with these two species.  Hybrid survival in the seed bank, germination and seedling establishment in the field are important components of fitness. Seed banks established in the soil after the field trials described above germinated in subsequent spring seasons. The predominantly brassica weed populations were screened for herbicide resistance and the numbers of interspecific hybrids germinating compared to the original frequency in the field trial results. Frequency of interspecific hybrids was reduced in the populations compared to the original seed deposit. Seed with a known frequency of interspecific hybrid seed was sown in a separate trial, and the frequency of interspecific hybrids compared at 0, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after sowing. Poor germination resulted limited competition between seedlings, however the frequency of interspecific hybrids declined over time indicating low plant fitness. There were no significant population effects on any parameters tested.  Interspecific hybrids grown in a glasshouse were backcrossed to the parental species and selfed within the plant and within populations. Pollen from the interspecific hybrids was found to have markedly reduced fertility. Interspecific hybrid plants had low female fertility, with the majority (88%) of the pollinated flowers aborting the siliques. Of the remaining siliques, most (98%) had only one to three seeds per silique. Inheritance of the herbicide resistance gene was regular in backcrosses but highly skewed following self pollination with an excess of herbicide-sensitive progeny. Production of a stochastic predictive model integrated the information acquired over the practical work phase of this thesis and utilised the capabilities of @risk, a new application of a risk analysis tool. The three outputs examined were the number of flowering plants resulting from backcrosses to rape and wild turnip and self pollination of the interspecific hybrid progeny. Five scenarios were modelled and all demonstrated the high likelihood of introgression failure in this system. In all scenarios, &gt;75% of simulations resulted in no interspecific hybrid progeny surviving to flowering in the third generation. In all scenarios, and for all three outputs, the seed set on the interspecific hybrids of the second generation was the major factor that limited the number interspecific hybrid progeny surviving to flowering in the third generation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">introgression</field><field name="subject">Brassica napus</field><field name="subject">Brassica rapa var. oleifera</field><field name="subject">wild turnip</field><field name="subject">rape</field><field name="subject">interspecific hybridization</field><field name="subject">pollination</field><field name="subject">predictive statistical modeling</field><field name="subject">UV reflectance</field><field name="subject">pollen vector</field><field name="subject">risk analysis of transgenic plants</field><field name="subject">interspecific hybrid fitness</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270800 Biotechnology::270803 Transgenesis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1844</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Starling (Sturnus vulgaris L.) predation on grass grub (Costelytra Zealandica (White), Melolonthinae) populations in Canterbury</field><field name="creator">East, R.</field><field name="description">The main object of this study was to investigate the effects of predation by starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) on populations of the grass grub (Costelytra zealandica) in Canterbury, with the secondary objective of investigating the feasibility of life table studies of grass grub populations under Canterbury conditions.

With studies on childhood still relatively new academic terrain, this research makes a contribution by identifying some key structural and social forces impacting upon childhood. This research investigated firstly how children spend their time in the after-school period, secondly the reasons why they do so, and thirdly parental and child understandings and opinions on this subject. Childhood was found to be differentially constructed by socioeconomic backgrounds, and mediated by employment status. Results suggest that increasing parental employment accompanied concerns over safety for children and the need to protect them. This meant that there was a tendency for families to mediate between the child and wider society through increased surveillance of children. For one-parent families this took the form of supervision of children through after-school programmes. Two-parent families, who were more able to organise their work arrangements so that one parent was home after-school, monitored their children's activities within localised areas based around the home. Parental 'risk anxiety' was seen to be shaping the lives of children in terms of defining safe places and spaces for them. Children themselves tended to prefer informal, unstructured activities within these contexts, and did not seem too concerned about safety issues.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">childhood</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">time</field><field name="subject">after-school</field><field name="subject">employment</field><field name="subject">safety</field><field name="subject">160801 - Applied Sociology, Program Evaluation and Social Impact Assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/2033</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determinants of e-government services adoption in developing countries: a field survey and a case study</field><field name="creator">Alhujran, Omar</field><field name="description">The rapid growth of investment in public service delivery through e-government has drawn attention to research on this area. However, both governments and academic researchers recognise the problem of low-level adoption of e-government services among citizens; the common problem in both developed and developing countries. E-government adoption, unlike most of IT adoption by employees in private-sector organizations, is voluntary and occurs often in turbulent social-political environments. Therefore, the problem needs to be addressed comprehensively from technological, social, political, and cultural perspectives. However, e-government adoption research currently lacks a comprehensive conceptual framework for explaining citizen adoption of e-government services. To fill this gap, this study extends the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) (Davis et al., 1989) by adding a set of social, political, and cultural constructs that are derived from different research literatures: government trustworthiness, perceived public value e-government programs, and national culture dimensions.  The extended model is then tested using multiple research methods: a large-scale, multi-site questionnaire survey of 335 Jordanian citizens, and case study interviews with e-government officials. Structural equation modelling and regressions analysis results indicate that citizen attitude towards using e-government services is the most significant determinant of citizen intention to use e-government services. Moreover, citizen attitude, in turn, is jointly determined by citizen belief: perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of an e-government service. These results provide new evidence for considering the attitude construct to study citizen adoption of e-government services which is voluntary in nature. Importantly, the results also suggest the importance of perceived public value as a significant determinant of the citizen&#8217;s belief. Furthermore, the results show strong evidence of a positive relationship between trustworthiness and citizen belief. Research limitations and future directions as well as managerial implications are also discussed.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1998</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD.

When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determinants of Asian Democratisation (1981-2005)</field><field name="creator">Azad, Abul Kalam</field><field name="description">As a culturally distinctive region, Asia was chosen as the sample for this study. This empirical study investigated what the major trends of democratisation were in Asia between 1981 and 2005: why some countries became democratic while other countries failed to follow suit during that period. The main research hypothesis was: &#8220;That is it was mainly economic development that drove democratisation in Asia between 1981 and 2005&#8221;. Although some studies have studied the impact of economic development on democratisation in Asia, their findings have been inconclusive and focuses sometimes different. [To investigate the research hypothesis, 24 Asian countries were selected&#8230;measurement tools used etc&#8230;] For this research work, statistical and case study methods were applied. The data used in the analyses were collected from established data sources e.g. Freedom House (Freedom in the World, n.d.) and United Nations Statistics Division (UN Stat, n.d.). Repeated Measures in Linear Mixed Modeling (LMM) were used to analyse the quantitative data. Three case studies supplemented the findings of statistical analyses. Historical information and institutional and legal facts were also used in the case studies. This study found that increases in the level of economic development along with its equitable distribution in society and positive roles of political actors increase the level of democratisation in Asia. Some pro-democratic political and social institutions, such as tradition of parliamentarianism, and international organisations, for example Bretton wood institutions, also led to democratisation. A low extent of national political divide was found to result in a considerably high level of democratisation in a country where confrontation between major political forces is the main feature of politics. This study also found that a partial democracy with Asian values, economic legitimacy, a lack of corruption and a &#8220;systematic control&#8221; over opposition politicians can survive, and is not prone to higher level of democratisation. The Taiwan case revealed that, amongst other factors, the role of political actors and economic equity along with economic development is also vital for democratisation. The Singapore case explained how a &#8220;hybrid regime&#8221; in a rich country outsmarts democratisation. The study of Bangladesh provides an idea about other elements, e.g. lower level of political confrontation, that push for higher levels of democratisation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Democracy democratization</field><field name="subject">Azad</field><field name="subject">Asia</field><field name="subject">Bangladesh</field><field name="subject">Singapore</field><field name="subject">Taiwan</field><field name="subject">Economic development</field><field name="subject">GDP per capita</field><field name="subject">World Bank</field><field name="subject">IMF</field><field name="subject">Politics</field><field name="subject">Political party</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/952</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Double Star</field><field name="creator">Thornton, Bernard Christopher Buchanan</field><field name="description">The work is situated in a literary and theoretical context by working with the concepts of authenticity and realism, and within that the story/world distinction.

A qualitative inquiry</field><field name="creator">Ianovski, Lola Eugenia</field><field name="description">This study is a stakeholder consultation about recovery policies and practices in Aotearoa/ New Zealand. Six consumer advocates and five policymakers were interviewed on whether evaluating mental health services&#8217; adherence to recovery philosophy would be useful in facilitating implementation of national recovery policies and the shape and function of such evaluation. Two focus groups and six individual interviews were conducted and transcribed. Textual data was subjected to software-assisted and manual thematic analyses. One of the key findings is participants&#8217; lack of confidence in the current implementation of the recovery paradigm within the New Zealand mental health sector. Participants generally supported the idea of measuring recovery orientation at organisational level, although for different reasons and with reservations.

Accelerated growth in the field of medical science has made data analysis more demanding and thus the complexity of decision-making procedures. Anaesthetists working in the operating theatre are responsible for carrying out a multitude of tasks which requires constant vigilance and thus a need for a smart decision support system has arisen. It is anticipated that such an automated decision support tool, capable of detecting pathological events can enhance the anaesthetist&#8217;s performance by providing the diagnostic information to the anaesthetist in an interactive and ergonomic display format. The main goal of this research was to develop a clinically useful diagnostic alarm system prototype for monitoring pathological events during anaesthesia. Several intelligent techniques, fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks, a probabilistic alarms and logistic regression were explored for developing the optimum diagnostic modules in detecting these events. New real-time diagnostic algorithms were developed and implemented in the form of a prototype system called real time &#8211; smart alarms for anaesthesia monitoring (RT-SAAM). Three diagnostic modules based on, fuzzy logic (Fuzzy Module), probabilistic alarms (Probabilistic Module) and respiration induced systolic pressure variations (SPV Module) were developed using MATLABTM and LabVIEWTM. In addition, a new data collection protocol was developed for acquiring data from the existing S/5 Datex-Ohmeda anaesthesia monitor in the operating theatre without disturbing the original setup. The raw physiological patient data acquired from the S/5 monitor were filtered, pre-processed and analysed for detecting anaesthesia related events like absolute hypovolemia (AHV) and fall in cardiac output (FCO) using SAAM. The accuracy of diagnoses generated by SAAM was validated by comparing its diagnostic information with the one provided by the anaesthetist for each patient. Kappa-analysis was used for measuring the level of agreement between the anaesthetist&#8217;s and RT-SAAM&#8217;s diagnoses. In retrospective (offline) analysis, RT-SAAM that was tested with data from 18 patients gave an overall agreement level of 81% (which implies substantial agreement between SAAM and anaesthetist). RT-SAAM was further tested in real-time with 6-patients giving an agreement level of 71% (which implies fair level of agreement). More real-time tests are required to complete the real-time validation and development of RT-SAAM. This diagnostic alarm system prototype (RT-SAAM) has shown that evidence based expert diagnostic systems can accurately diagnose AHV and FCO events in anaesthetized patients and can be useful in providing decision support to the anaesthetists.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Diagnostic alarm systems</field><field name="subject">Smart decision support systems</field><field name="subject">Real-time diagnostic algorithms</field><field name="subject">Patient monitoring</field><field name="subject">Anesthesia monitoring</field><field name="subject">Probabilistic alarms</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/956</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of preheating condition on strength of AA6060 Aluminium Alloy for extrusion</field><field name="creator">Meng, Cheng</field><field name="description">Fletcher Aluminium is a New Zealand company that manufactures aluminium extrusions for the building market. Their extrusion process involves using a hydraulic ram to force heated raw supplied material, in the form of large diameter cylindrical logs, through a die land that is the desired product shape. The final quality of the extruded product is influenced by the extrusion temperature, ram pressure and extrusion speed. The speed of extrusion at Fletcher Aluminium is limited by the extrusion ram pressure because the extrusion machine is operating at the pressure limit of the compressor. Currently the company requires an increase in the extrusion speed, while maintaining quality requirements where these improvements are desired without upgrading the compressor. The press pressure is required to overcome friction and the flow stress of the billet, which is dependent on the precipitates and solutes conditions and their strengthening effects in the billet. However, the preheating temperature and extrusion speeds need to be sufficiently low enough to avoid hot tearing. This research starts to increase the ram speed by decreasing the Mg2Si content for precipitation strengthening. Heat treatment may be used to dissolve Mg2Si content by billet preheat to a temperature at or exceeds solvus temperature (TSolvus). However, a higher (than TSolvus) billet temperature may have two conflicting effects. First, a higher temperature in general reduces the flow stress thus lowering the required pressure. On the other hand, at temperature higher than Tsolvus, Mg2Si should completely dissolve, resulting in solid solution strengthening thus increasing the flow stress. The objective of the study is to quantify the strengthening contributions from solute atoms (Mg / Si) and precipitates (Mg2Si) on the as-received and heat treated test samples using room temperature mechanical testing and phase diagram analysis. The selected heat treatment conditions fully enclose the preheating temperature and time range currently used in Fletcher Aluminium production. Simulations of the extrusion were conducted by hot compression testing (Gleeble test), to measure the combination of strengthening effects during deformation at elevated temperatures. The room temperature tests have shown that hardness, yield strength (YS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) are minimised at approximately 405&#176;C. The minimum point is shown to be caused by the combination of strengthening and softening due to solid solution and precipitation strengthening. The higher values of hardness, YS and UTS at lower and higher preheating temperatures are mainly due to precipitation and solution strengthening respectively. The findings show that, the solution of Mg2Si gradually increases as the temperature increases at temperatures exceeding 405&#176;C. Hardness, YS and UTS were compared in order to determine the correlation between each mechanical property. A correlation exists, but it is not simple to translate between each mechanical property. The relationship between hardness and stress observed for 8% permanent strain was also investigated; there was no improvement in correlation. The elevated temperature tests show that initial flow stress and peak flow stress reduces linearly with temperature increases, which means higher testing temperature results lower precipitation and solid solution strengthening effects. Additionally, the constants of the Gleeble &#8211; Holomon equation were numerically calculated and are similar to published values. The Gleeble &#8211; Holomon equation was combined with Felthams equation in order to provide a relationship between extrusion velocity and extrusion temperature.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aluminium extrusion</field><field name="subject">AA6060</field><field name="subject">Aluminium extrusion pre-heating</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/957</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The prediction of educational outcomes in the adult learner, using the Theory of Planned Behaviour and self-esteem</field><field name="creator">Clark, Christine</field><field name="description">Adult students (n = 211) from a Private Training Establishment located in a low socio-economic area of Counties Manukau, New Zealand, were assessed for intent to achieve and actual outcome. Each year in New Zealand approximately 25% of students leaving school do so with no qualifications. It is estimated that in the Counties Manukau Region there are 77,000 adults with no educational qualifications, impacting on earning ability and on self-esteem. Failure rate at tertiary education is high, with 38% of under 18 year olds not achieving, and this figure worsens with age. The cost to New Zealand of having people not in employment, not in education and not in training is estimated to be close to $1.0 billion per year and in Counties Manukau the cost of youth unemployment is between $55 and $73 million per annum. This study applied The Theory of Planned Behaviour to assess intent to achieve, and was expanded to include a self-esteem component (Rosenberg&#8217;s Self-Esteem Scale, 1965). The Theory of Planned Behaviour sufficiently predicted intent, and was significantly improved with the self-esteem component. The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale successfully predicted outcome, however findings need to be interpreted with caution. The initial self-esteem levels (M=20.59), whilst just above the accepted criteria (M=20.00) validate other studies indicating that New Zealand has an over-all low level of self-esteem compared with other similar countries. These findings indicate opportunity for future research into the prediction of outcome and ability of learning establishments to mitigate risk of non-achievement for the adult learner. They also support the further investigation of the low level of self-esteem as evidenced in this study.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Outcomes</field><field name="subject">Theory of Planned Behaviour</field><field name="subject">Self-esteem</field><field name="subject">Rosenburg</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/959</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polymerisation and export of alginate in Pseudomanas aeruginosa : functional assignment and catalytic mechanism of Alg8/44 : a thesis presented to Massey University in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Microbiology</field><field name="creator">Remminghorst, Uwe</field><field name="description">Alginate biosynthesis is not only a major contributor to pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa but also an important factor in colonization of adverse environmental habitats by biofilm formation. The requirement of proteins Alg8 and Alg44, encoded by their respective genes in the alginate biosynthesis gene cluster, for alginate biosynthesis of P. aeruginosa was demonstrated, since deletion mutants were unable to produce or polymerise alginate. AlgX deletion mutants failed to produce the alginate characteristic mucoid phenotype, but showed low concentrations of uronic acid monomers in the culture supernatants. Complementation experiments using PCR based approaches were used to determine the complementing ORF and all deletion mutants could be complemented to at least wildtype levels by introducing a plasmid harbouring the respective gene. Increased copy numbers of Alg44 did not impact on the amount of alginate produced, whereas increased copy numbers of the alg8 gene led to an at least 10 fold stronger alginate production impacting on biofilm structure and stability. Topological analysis using reporter protein fusions and subsequent subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that Alg8 is located in the cytoplasmic membrane and contains at least 4 transmembrane helices, 3 of them at its C terminus. Its large cytosolic loop showed similarities to inverting glycosyltransferases and the similarities were used to generate a threading model using SpsA, a glycosyltransferase involved in spore coat formation of B. subtilis, as a template. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the importance of identified motifs commonly detected in glycosyltransferases. Inactivation of the DXD motif, which has been shown to be involved in nucleotide sugar binding, led to loss-offunction mutants of Alg8 and further replacements revealed putative candidates for the catalytic residue(s). Contradicting the commonly reported prediction of being a transmembrane protein, Alg44 was shown to be a periplasmic protein. The highest specific alkaline phosphatase activity of its fusion protein could be detected in the periplasmic fraction and not in the insoluble membrane fraction. Bioinformatical analysis of Alg44 revealed structural similarities of its N terminus to PilZ domains, shown to bind cyclic-di-GMP, and of its C terminus to MexA, a membrane fusion protein involved in multi-drug efflux systems. Thus, it was suggested that Alg44 has a regulatory role for alginate biosynthesis in bridging the periplasm and connecting outer and cytoplasmic membrane components. AlgX was shown to interact with MucD, a periplasmic serine protease or chaperone homologue, and is suggested to exert its impact on alginate production via MucD interaction. In vitro alginate polymerisation assays revealed that alginate production requires protein components of the outer and cytoplasmic membrane as well as the periplasm, and these data were used to construct a model describing a multi-enzyme, membrane and periplasm spanning complex for alginate polymerisation, modification and export.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pseudomonas aeruginosa</field><field name="subject">alginates</field><field name="subject">biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation into the acidic protein fraction of bovine whey and its effect on bone cells : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Science in Chemistry at Massey University, New Zealand EMBARGOED till 1 December 2015</field><field name="creator">Mullan, Bernadette Jane</field><field name="description">Milk is provided to new borns as their first food source and it contains essential nutrients, vitamins and other beneficial components, such as enzymes and antibodies that are required for rapid growth and development of the new born and for sustained growth over time. Milk contains two main types of proteins; casein proteins and whey proteins. Although casein proteins account for up to 80% of the proteins found in bovine milk, it is the whey protein that has become of high interest because of its bioactive content. Whey, a very watery mixture of lactose, proteins, minerals and trace amounts of fat, is formed from milk when the milk is coagulated and/or the casein proteins are removed from the milk. Bovine whey protein, including both the acidic and basic fractions (low and high isoelectric point, respectively), has previously been studied in vitro (cell based) and in vivo (using rats) for its impact on bone to determine if it can help improve bone mineral density and help reduce the risk of developing bone diseases, such as osteoporosis. Bone is constantly undergoing a remodelling process of being dissolved and reformed and the two main cell types responsible for this bone remodelling process are mature osteoclasts, which dissolve (resorb) bone, and osteoblasts, which reform the bone. Prior work has shown that acidic protein fractions derived from different sources of whey protein concentrate (WPC) have both in vivo and in vitro activity on bone, particularly anti-resorptive properties. However, the component(s) which confer activity have not yet been identified. In this thesis, work was undertaken to better understand the analytical composition of three types of WPC (cheese, mineral acid and lactic acid) and their associated acidic protein fractions and relate this to bone activity in the hope of identifying where the activity lies. Bone activity was assessed using in vitro screening with osteoblast cells (MC3T3-E1) and osteoclast cells (RAW 264.7). Comparison of the cell-based bone activity of the parent WPCs and corresponding acidic fractions indicated that the acidic fractions derived from both mineral acid and lactic WPC were superior in their ability to inhibit osteoclast development. Although compositional data was complex and definitive correlations with both bone bioactivities could not be made, it appeared that elements common to both the acidic fractions were a higher proportion of GLYCAM-1 and bone sialoprotein-1 (osteopontin). Further studies to more closely investigate the bone bioactivity of the acidic fractions are warranted.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bovine whey protein concentrate</field><field name="subject">Acidic protein fractions</field><field name="subject">Bone bioactivity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250300 Organic Chemistry::250302 Biological and medical chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1415</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Franchising in the real estate agency sector : multiple perspectives and converging angles of inquiry : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, Massey University</field><field name="creator">Flint-Hartle, Susan</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the widespread phenomenon of franchising in the real estate agency sector. To date, franchising research has been largely multi disciplinary, explanatory theory relatively undeveloped and there has been heavy reliance on the point of view of the franchisor. This thesis broadens investigation to include multiple perspectives of both the franchisor and franchisee. It examines the important contribution made to the relationship by both parties and the nature of their parallel business venturing. Drawing on data collected from the main real estate franchisors operating in New Zealand and from samples of franchisee business owners in the Asia-Pacific region, the study uses a pragmatic mixed methodological approach. It is believed by breaking the quantitative tradition the complex nature and sector specific characteristics of franchising can be better understood. Two interlinked studies are undertaken. First, the franchisor's perspective of franchising is examined and a window study is used to illustrate the notion of resource competency. Second, franchising as an entrepreneurial activity mainly from the franchisee point of view expands existing debate linking franchising with the entrepreneurship domain. It is argued that the strategic decision to franchise taken by real estate agency franchisors requires a wider explanation than offered by current agency and resource scarcity theory. The success of franchising in this sector is based on the development of a sophisticated resource competency that ensures a highly evolved, sustaining relationship with the franchisee and perpetuation into the mature growth phase. Franchising systems are defined as entrepreneurial organisations in which cooperation between two different types of entrepreneur takes place. The franchisor initiates the system and builds the brand while the franchisee develops the local market. Thus value is created as entrepreneurial ventures are established and flourish. Franchisors and franchisees amalgamate innovations and franchisees develop their own resource competencies complimentary to the parent organisation. Together with the people involved, wealth creation and innovative processes and activities undertaken by both parties in the relationship, franchising in real estate agency is shown to be fully compatible with entrepreneurship constructs.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Franchising</field><field name="subject">Entrepreneurship</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1437</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of multipurpose fodder trees in Nepal : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.

Understanding the complex farming systems that provide a living for 65% of the 27.1 million people in Nepal is the key to designing effective programmes of research and development. Evaluation methods include review of past work, farmers group workshops to identify current practice in the use of MFT in Nepal, studies on biomass production of Artocarpus lakoocha and Ficus glaberrima trees older than 50 years in Nepal and the propagation of F. benjamina, comparison of the feeding preferences of sheep for alternative browse species, and study of the nutritive value of alternative forage diets for lactating buffalo. Reviews showed 2.2 million cattle and 1 million buffalo are an extra burden to steep land where productivity is declining at the rate of 1.25% per year. Indigenous knowledge identified Ficus glaberrima with its three varieties (Maghe, Chaite and Jethe), A. lakoocha, F. benjamina and Bassia butyracea as the best four MFT for renovating degraded lands. A survey study showed significantly higher dry matter (DM) production by F. glaberrima than A. lakoocha (154 vs 91 kg DM /tree/year) during dry periods at low altitude (800 - 1000m). There was no significant difference in production of fat - corrected milk (FCM ) between buffalos eating A. lakoocha, F.glaberrima or a diet of 53% straw and 47% F. glaberrima (DM basis). Metabolisable energy balance (MJME/day) was greater in Artocarpus than Ficus, with the mixed diet intermediate (+1.60, -0.34 and -12.94 MJ ME/buffalo/day respectively, relative to requirements, P=0.0318). When fed together in an indoor trial, poplar (48% = 106 g DM/sheep/day) and willow (43% = 95 g DM/sheep/day) were preferred to Ficus benjamina (8% = 18 g DM/sheep/day) by sheep, reflecting the greater maturity and structural strength of leaves of Ficus. These results are used to develop recommendations for choice of MFT species and management strategies to improve the sustainability and productivity of livestock systems incorporating fodder trees</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cattle fodder</field><field name="subject">Sheep fodder</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production::300403 Animal nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1438</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Instant milk powder production : determining the extent of agglomeration : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Chemical Technology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Williams, Anna M</field><field name="description">Agglomerated milk powders are produced to give improved properties such as flowability, dispersibility, reduced dustiness and decreased bulk density. A key function of these powders is to dissolve "instantly" upon addition to water and because of this they are also called "instant milk powders". They are produced by agglomerating the undersized fines that are returned to the top of the spray drier with milk concentrate droplet spray. Interaction occurs in a collision zone, often with multiple sprays and fines return lines. Agglomeration can be a difficult process to control and operators find it hard to fine tune the process to produce specific powder properties. This work aimed to understand the effects of key droplet and fines properties on the extent of agglomeration to allow a mechanistic understanding of the process. Three scales of spray drier were investigated in this study with different rates of evaporation; a small scale drier (0.5 - 7 kg water h-1), a pilot scale drier (80 kg water h-1) and a range of commercial production scale driers (4 - 15 000 kg water h-1). A survey of operators of commercial scale driers showed that control of instant milk powder production to influence bulk density is highly intuitive. Fines recycle rates were expected to be important in control of agglomeration processes and were estimated on a specific plant by using the pressure drop measured in the fines return line. A model based on pressure drop along a pneumatic pipeline under-predicted the experimental values for pressure drop due to solids, which means a calibration curve should be generated for each specific drier. Fines recycle rates were predicted to be significantly higher at 95 to 130 % of production rates compared to those expected by operators of 50%. Experimental measurements agreed with existing models for the effect of temperature on the density and viscosity of milk concentrates. Experimental results showed that the surface tensions of concentrated milks were within the same range as literature values for standard milks below 60&#176;C, but were significantly higher for milk above 60&#176;C. This is thought to be linked to the mechanism of skin formation due to disulphide cross linking at high temperatures and concentrations. Powder properties were also established for selected products produced on the commercial scale driers. These powders were then used in experiments on the two smaller driers. Because collision frequency depends on the velocity and droplet size of sprays; these properties were measured for the small scale drier and estimated, where possible, for the pilot and commercial driers. The small scale agglomerating spray drier was configured to alter droplet and particle properties when interacting a vertical fines particle curtain with a horizontal spray sheet. An extensive design and improvement process was carried out to ensure the system consistently delivered these streams in a controllable manner. The processes of collision and adhesion occur very quickly inside the spray drier. In order to assess the extent of agglomeration that has occurred, the feed streams must be compared to the final product stream. An ideal way to do this is to use an agglomeration index which compares the particle size distributions of the feed (fines recycle and spray streams) and the particle size distribution of the product stream (the agglomerated powder). The index described changes between these steams across the particle size distribution and is called an agglomeration efficiency, &#958;g. However, it was found that the presence of fines in the product of the one-pass design obscured the agglomerates formed. The agglomeration efficiency, &#958;g, was modified to become &#958;h which subtracted the fines stream from the agglomerated product distribution. In this way &#958;h models industrial operation where the fines are recycled, by effectively just comparing the spray and product streams entering and leaving the process. The small scale drier was used for an experimental study on natural and forced agglomeration, where the drier was operated with spray only, then with spray and fines. For natural agglomeration, SEM images of the product powder indicated that little agglomeration occurred between spray droplets. The product yield was unacceptably low (~ 40%) due to adhesion of spray droplets to the drying chamber wall opposing the horizontal spray. When the fines curtain was introduced in the forced agglomeration experiments, product yield increased above 50% because the fines acted as collectors for the spray droplets. However, the agglomeration performance of the modified spray drier was lower than expected. The equipment design was then optimised by considering three key issues; fines dispersion, droplet dispersion and stickiness, and agglomerate breakdown. Final experiments studied agglomeration at low fines to spray mass flux ratios and showed that increasing the fines size had a positive effect on agglomeration efficiency,&#958;h. The agglomeration study at pilot scale identified the effect of key variables, total solids, concentrate and fines flow rate, and fines size on the agglomeration efficiency. A dimensionless flux approach was used to explain the experimental results. The fines to spray mass flux ratio and the projected area flux ratio (at constant concentrate flow rate) were found to be the most suitable to represent the physical processes during agglomeration. Experimental results showed that a higher dimensionless flux resulted in more agglomeration and as well as small fines size and atomising low solids concentrate. The critical Stokes number highlighted the importance of particle size and collision velocity on the outcome of the collision as well as the importance of stickiness on adherence following the collision. A statistical analysis established a relational model for predicting the agglomeration efficiency based on fines size, total solids and the fines to spray mass flux ratio. This thesis has gained insight into agglomeration processes during spray drying and knowledge about how to define the extent of agglomeration. Practical findings from this research can have a significant impact on successful spray drying operation for instant powders. There are some practical steps to be taken industrially to promote the control of agglomerating spray driers. The first step is to measure and control the flow of fines recycled to the top of the spray drier. The next step is to validate the findings at industrial scale and link the agglomeration index to the bulk powder properties. However, there are many challenges that remain to be tackled in the area of milk powder agglomeration. Milk powder agglomeration at the top of the spray drier is a complex process involving many different variables. A more detailed study of the micro processes that occur during agglomeration will give increased understanding of the relationships between key operating variables and agglomerate properties.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dried milk</field><field name="subject">Milk powder processing</field><field name="subject">Agglomerated milk powders</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290103 Food processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1439</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Milk composition of the New Zealand sea lion and factors that influence it : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Zoology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Riet Sapriza, Federico Germ&#225;n</field><field name="description">The objectives of the present study were to: 1) describe the gross chemical milk composition of the New Zealand sea lion (NZSLs), Phocarctos hookeri, in early lactation; 2) validate an analytical method for sea lion milk composition; 3) investigate a series of temporal, individual and dietary factors that influence the milk composition of the NZSL and; 4) investigate the temporal and spatial differences in the fatty acids signatures of sea lion milk. A comprehensive literature review revealed that data on milk composition in otariid species is either missing or limited, that to be able to fully describe their milk composition extensive sampling was required and that the temporal, maternal and offspring factors that influence milk composition in pinnipeds are poorly understood. The review identified that considerable work has been conducted to infer diet via the application of fatty acids signature analysis of milk and blubber. There are many factors (i.e. metabolism, de novo synthesis and endogenous sources) that contribute to the differences in fatty acid composition between the diet and milk or blubber. Milk samples from NZSL were used to test whether a new method would give similar results as the standard methods of milk analysis. Agreement between analytical methods for milk components was assessed using different measures of statistical fitness and the results indicated that the new method was comparable to the standard methods and applicable to the milk of sea lions, pinnipeds and to ecological studies of lactation. Milk from NZSLs was collected over a period of seven years (1997, 1999 to 2003, and 2005) in early lactation to describe the composition of milk of NZSL and to test for differences between years. The results indicated that: i) the milk protein concentration was comparable to other species of pinnipeds; ii) the milk fat concentration and the milk energy content of NZSL is the lowest reported for otariids in early lactation; however iii) the milk fat concentration was significantly different between years. These results suggested that the milk composition of NZSLs was influenced by annual changes in the environment; however, there may be other unidentified factors. Month, maternal body condition, age, body weight and length, offspring sex and age, and attendance pattern were compared with milk components. The results identified that month, maternal body condition and age significantly affected milk fat concentration. These results and the fact that maternal body condition varied significantly between years and mothers nursing male pups had lower body condition and produced milk lower in energy content suggested that local food resources along with other unidentified factors have an effect on the reproductive success of NZSLs. To test whether the fatty acid signature analysis (FASA) of lipid rich tissues (milk, blubber and serum) of otariids could be used to infer diet a mixture of vegetable oil (with distinctive fatty acid signature) was fed to 24 lactating NZSL and tissue samples were collected at different time intervals. Significant increases in the concentration of specific fatty acids in serum and milk were observed with peaks within 12hrs and 24hrs respectively of ingestion. Concentrations in milk remained elevated for up to 72hrs and there were differential rates of incorporation into milk. These findings confirm the potential of FASA to infer the composition of the diet. The variation in milk fatty acid signatures from lactating NZSL from four years (1997, 2003, 2004 and 2005) of sampling were measured in order to test whether differences occurred between years. Fatty acids signatures from five potential prey species including the commercially important arrow squid were incorporated into the analysis to associate the changes in milk fatty acids with a shift in prey choice. The results indicated that milk fatty acid signatures were different in 1997 and 2003; however, it was not possible to relate these differences to the five prey species. The variability in the annual arrow squid catch data suggested that local food resources around the Auckland Islands may also be variable. In conclusion, the milk produced by the NZSL has the lowest concentration of fat and energy in early lactation reported for any otariid species. The main factors that contributed to changes in milk quality were stage of lactation, year and maternal body condition. The yearly variation in the quality of milk appears to be a result of their lactation strategy or to variable local food conditions that also affect maternal body condition. Therefore monitoring the annual milk quality may be a means to monitor the health of a pinniped population and potential management tool for pinniped species. This thesis has shown that annual changes in the diet of NZSL can be assessed with milk fatty acid signatures.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand sea lion</field><field name="subject">Lactation</field><field name="subject">Milk composition</field><field name="subject">Milk quality</field><field name="subject">Milk fat</field><field name="subject">Fatty acid composition</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270600 Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1440</field></doc></add>
