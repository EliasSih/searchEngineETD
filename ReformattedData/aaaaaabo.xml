This thesis investigates academics&#8217; insights and experiences about their changing teacher identities in the context of being, or becoming, a facilitator of online student learning. This was an empirical research project, a collective case study that explored the teaching experiences of twelve university lecturers in two Australian universities who taught online, or were making the move online. Primary research data were drawn from semi-structured conversations with the lecturers, online teaching artefacts and email communications. The interpretative analysis was organised according to three overlapping lecturer identities: the teaching metaphors of performance, care and creative direction. From the perspective of each metaphor position, the move to becoming a facilitator of blended learning was uneasy. The performer/carer/director lecturer struggled to entertain, care and intervene in familiar ways in asynchronous, computer-mediated communication. Online, the performing/caring/directing lecturer was ignored by students, and became instead a helpless and highly reflexive bystander to students&#8217; learning. The findings suggest that the teaching values and practices of the performing/caring/directing lecturer, in particular lecturer-student responsiveness and reciprocity, do not adapt to online pedagogies. Indeed, blended learning establishes the conditions for a new moral order in university education, with the move to online facilitation best understood as a move to management-centred regulation of teaching and student learning. And so, overlooked in higher education policy and research, and ignored by her students online, the performing/caring/directing lecturer is under erasure, at the same time as the work of the facilitator is being archived.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lecturer.</field><field name="subject">Technology.</field><field name="subject">Teaching.</field><field name="subject">Academics.</field><field name="subject">Internet.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/391</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Falling behind': a grounded theory of uncritical decision making.</field><field name="creator">Pratt, Jonathan Gordon MacLeod</field><field name="description">University of Technology, Sydney.

Six species of the genus Pseudomugil, and the related Scaturiginichthys venneilipinnis, are found on the Australian continent. The normal breeding behaviour, egg surface morphology and embryology of four species of Pseudomugil (P. signijer, P. genrudae, P. tenellus and P. mellis) were first investigated, using aquarium and microscopic (light and S.E.M.) studies. The four species were divided into two groups: P. signifer and P. mellis; and P. tenellus and P. gertrudae. The study provided further evidence for the view that the embryology of the genus Pseudomugil differs markedly from that of members of the family Melanotaeniidae, with which the pseudomugilids have previously been grouped. The seasonal pattern of gonadal function in P. signifer, both in the field and in aquariums, was then investigated for populations of P. signifer from the Sydney region. It was found that P. signifer bred over the spring and summer months, commencing breeding as the temperature and daylength increased, and declining in breeding activity as daylength and temperature declined. There was no substantial difference in the pattern of reproductive activity between wild and captive stocks of P. signifer in the populations used. The impact of the presence of the introduced G. holbrooki on P. signifer was then examined, first in open-air tank experiments , and then in the field. In the tank experiments the exotic species profoundly affected the breeding of the native species. When G. holbrooki were in the tanks P. signifer did not gain weight or grow in total length (except for females given supplementary feed); ovarian weight and fecundity was greatly reduced and the ovaries were morphologically undeveloped. No eggs from P. signifer were observed in tanks which also housed G. holbrooki. G. holbrooki were observed to actively hunt and eat young P. signifer and to nip the caudal fins of adult P. signifer. The results indicate clearly, that at least in a captive situation, the presence of the exotic species has a very deleterious effect on breeding and hence possible survival, of a native population. A pilot study conducted at the same time as the harvest of the second tank study did not reveal such drastic consequences. However, even in the less confined field situation, some evidence of an interrelation between water quality, numbers of P. signifer and numbers of G. holbrooki were seen in one disturbed site (Home bush Bay). These findings suggest that a newly designed field experiment based on data collected from the power analysis of the pilot study could clarify whether G. holbrooki adversely affects P. signifer in the wild. The information gained from these studies can be used in the management of P. signifer in the wild, and serve as a model of the possible effects upon other native species.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pacific blue-eye.</field><field name="subject">Eastern gambusia.</field><field name="subject">Freshwater fishes.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/955</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The experiences of midwives involved with the development and implementation of CenteringPregnancy at two hospitals in Australia.</field><field name="creator">Teate, Alison Judith</field><field name="description">Aims : The aims of the study were to describe the experiences of the midwives who were part of the first Australian CenteringPregnancy Pilot Study and to inform the future development of CenteringPregnancy. Background CenteringPregnancy is a model of group antenatal care that has evolved over the past two decades in North America. A pilot study that explored the feasibility of implementing CenteringPregnancy in Australia was undertaken in 2006-2008. I was the research midwife employed to coordinate this study and I explored the experiences of the midwives who were participants as the focus of my Master of Midwifery (Honours) research. Method : An Action Research approach was undertaken to study the implementation of CenteringPregnancy in Australia. This included a qualitative descriptive study to describe and explore the experiences of the midwives who were participants. The study was set in two hospital antenatal clinics and two outreach community health-care centres in southern Sydney. Eight midwives and three research team members formed the Action Research group. Data collected were primarily from focus groups and surveys and were analysed using simple descriptive statistics and thematic content analysis. Findings : CenteringPregnancy enabled midwives to develop relationships with the women in their groups and with their peers in the Action Research group. The group antenatal care model enhanced the development of relationships between midwives and women that were necessary for professional fulfilment and the appreciation of relationship-based care. The use of supportive organisational change, enabled by Action Research methods, facilitated midwives to develop new skills that were appropriate for the group care setting and in line with a strengths-based approach. Issues of low staffing rates, lack of available facilities for groups, time constraints, recruitment difficulties and resistance to change impacted on widespread implementation of CenteringPregnancy. Conclusions : The experience of the midwives who provided CenteringPregnancy care suggests that it is an appropriate model of care for the Australian midwifery context, particularly if organisational support and recruitment strategies and access to appropriate facilities are addressed. The midwives who undertook CenteringPregnancy engaged in a new way of working that enhanced their appreciation of relationship-based care and was positive to their job satisfaction. Implications for practice Effective ways to implement CenteringPregnancy models of care in Australia were identified in this study. These included a system of support for the midwives engaging in facilitating groups for the first time. It is important that organisations also develop other supportive strategies, including the provision of adequate group spaces, effective recruitment plans and positive support systems for change management. In the light of current evidence the development of continuity of care models which enhance the relationship between an individual women and her midwife, it is important to explore the effects of group care on this unique relationship.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CenteringPregnancy.</field><field name="subject">Pregnancy.</field><field name="subject">Antenatal care.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1005</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Potential for phytoremediation of a metalliferous mine site at Mt.

However with increasing human pressures, many estuaries along the coastline of Australia have become degraded. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the effects of estuarine metal contaminants on the physiology, and the subsequent accumulation, in the smooth toadfish, Tetractenos glaber, and their prey items in estuaries in the Sydney region, south eastern Australia. Toadfish and sediments were collected during three seasonal sampling periods (June 2002, September 2002 and January 2003) in four estuaries in the Sydney region (Port Hacking River, Cowan Creek, Parramatta River and Lake Macquarie). Sediment and toadfish tissue metal concentrations varied both spatially and temporally, with highest concentrations exhibited in the metal contaminated estuaries (Lake Macquarie and Parramatta River) during spring 2002 and summer 2003. Toadfish accumulated metals in different tissue, however field experiments were limited in determining the main pathways of accumulation. Controlled laboratory kinetic experiments using radioisotopes of 109Cd and 75Se, indicated that differences in the relative contributions of water and food in the accumulation of these metals are generally governed by the physiology of the toadfish and the type of prey eaten. The distribution of metals in fish organs is important for better understanding metal kinetics and their subsequent toxicity. Toadfish exposed to 109Cd in both water or food showed a shift in distribution from gut lining at the end of the uptake phase to the excretory organs, such as liver, by the end of the loss phase, suggesting that the main uptake pathway for water exposure was via the gut and not the gills, due to fish drinking large amounts of water to maintain osmoregulation. There was no appreciable shift in the distribution of 75Se from the uptake or loss phases, being mostly associated with the excretory organs (gills, liver and kidneys). Further investigation into the accumulation of metals in toadfish prey items revealed that differences in uptake and loss of 109Cd and 75Se were influenced by their aqueous speciation, as well as differences in animal physiology, sequestration, storage and excitation mechanisms. The uptake rates and CFs of 109Cd and 75Se were highest, and the biological half-lives the longest, in pygmy mussels, ghost shrimps and polychaetes relative to the semaphore and soldier crabs. Elevated metal concentrations in certain toadfish tissues from the four estuaries were linked to reduced lipid concentrations and increased protein concentrations, which may be detrimental for growth, reproductive output and survivorship of the fish. A closer investigation into the nutritional value and metal concentrations of toadfish prey items in a selected metal contaminated estuary (Parramatta River) revealed that toadfish from the more contaminated sites within the estuary may grow faster due to higher nutritional value of prey items on a local scale, however on a larger spatial scale, this was not evident. Further investigation is required to determine whether larger toadfish size can be attributed to physiological acclimation or genetic resistance through generations of continuous metal exposure. Many studies have assessed metal concentrations in water, sediments and biota in the field, however few studies have combined both field and laboratory experiments to examine the effects of metals on fish physiology and reproduction, and metal transfer pathways in aquatic biota. This study has contributed to a better understanding of metal accumulation and its physiological effects in estuarine biota and highlights the high spatial and temporal variability in responses of organisms to environmental metal pollution.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heavy metals.</field><field name="subject">Estuarine biology.</field><field name="subject">Toadfishes.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1103</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Portfolio credit risk modelling and CDO pricing - analytics and implied trees from CDO tranches</field><field name="creator">Peng, Tao</field><field name="description">One of the most successful and most controversial innovative financial products in recent years has been collateralised debt obligations (CDOs). The dimensionality of dependency embedded in a typical CDO structure poses great challenges for researchers - in both generating realistic default dynamics and correlation, and in the mean time achieving fast and accurate model calibration. The research presented in this thesis contributes to the class of bottom-up models, which, as opposed to top-down models, start by modelling the individual obligor default process and then moving them up through the dependency structures to build up the loss distributions at the portfolio level. The Gaussian model (Li 2000) is a static copula model. It has only on correlation parameter, which can be calibrated to one CDO tranche at a time. Its simplicity achieves wide spread industry application even though it suffers from the problem of &#8217;correlation smile&#8217;. In other words, it cannot fit the market in an arbitrage-free manner in the capital-structure dimension. The first contribution of this thesis is the sensitivities analysis with regard to model parameters of expected losses of CDO tranches in the Gaussian and NIG copula models. The study provided substantial insight into the essence of the dependency structure. In addition, we apply the intensity approach to credit modelling in order to imply market distributions non-parametrically in the form of a binomial lattice. Under the same framework, we developed a series of three models. The static binomial model can be calibrated to the CDS index tranches exactly, with one set of parameters. The model can be seen as a non-parametric copula model that is arbitrage free in the capital-structure dimension. Static models are not suitable to price portfolio credit derivatives that are dynamic in nature. The static model can be naturally developed into a dynamic binomial model and satisfies no-arbitrage conditions in the time dimension. This setup, however, reduces model flexibility and calibration speed. The computational complexity comes from the non-Markovian character of the default process in the dynamic model. Inspired by Mortensen (2006), in which the author defines the intensity integral as a conditioning variable, we modify the dynamic model into a Markovian model by modelling the intensity integral directly, which greatly reduces the computational time and increases model fit in calibration. We also show that, when stochastic recovery rates are involved, there is a third no-arbitrage condition for the expected loss process that needs to be built into the Markovian model. For all binomial models, we adopt a unique optimisation algorithm for model calibration - the Cross Entropy method. It is particularly advantageous in solving large-scale non-linear optimsation problems with multiple local extrema, as encountered in our model.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Collateralised debt obligations.</field><field name="subject">Binomial coefficients.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1104</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Network controlled vertical handover for heterogeneous networks</field><field name="creator">Gami, Prashant Prabhulal</field><field name="description">Future wireless networks are expected to be a convergence of different wireless networks based on single Radio Access Technology. The aim is to provide seamless services to users any time from anywhere in the world using proper devices. In order to achieve this goal, seamless transition from one network to another with acceptable quality of service is required. Handover from one network to another is known as inter network or vertical handover. Currently known Mobile Controlled Vertical Handover schemes have some limitations. Mobile Station is limited with power and has very limited information about networks. Due to these limitations, Mobile Controlled Vertical Handover (MCVHO) can not achieve high performance in terms of hand over delay and handover decision. In this thesis, a new Network Controlled Vertical Handover (NCVHO) scheme is proposed. Proposed NCVHO scheme uses information which is available only to network along with information available to mobile node to enhance handover decision and reduce total number of handover and call dropping. NCVHO scheme also reduces the signaling on the wireless part of the network which reduces the usage of air interface. The scheme allows Point of Attachment (PoA) to make handover decision on behalf of mobile node which reduces signaling on the wireless part of the network. This change in a vertical handover scheme reduces signaling delay of the handover and achieves better handover delay performance. NCVHO scheme is reduces signaling on the air interface and uses more information to make handover decision which can achieve higher performance for number of handovers and call dropping than MCVHO. The price is paid as increased processing delay at the Point of Attachment (poA). Simulation in this thesis shows that NCVHO performance decreases at higher number of users in comparison with MCVHO. A solution to this problem is also proposed in this thesis with some modification to NCVHO scheme, a new network controlled vertical handover scheme called distributed Network Controlled Vertical Handover (distNCVHO) is proposed. The scheme achieves better performance than NCVHO scheme in terms of handover delay, number of handovers and call dropping. It is noticed in this thesis that more information available from the network can enhance handover decision which can in turn reduce total number of handovers with a large margin. Information such as network load, network properties such as coverage, available bandwidth can play a vital role in the handover decision making. Reduced usage of air interface can allow network to perform handover faster and reduce number of total handover attempts.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1105</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relative benefit of reliable heading updates on urban wayfinding</field><field name="creator">Waters, Wilfred</field><field name="description">Prior research about wayfinding has found that females tend to employ a single strategy based on landmarks, where males are more versatile, using a dual strategy of landmarks and global orientation information such as cardinal directions (Lawton, 2010). It was proposed that this difference occurs due to males&#8217; better sense of direction, which would deliver more trustworthy indications of current heading. Since males&#8217; versatility has often been linked with better navigation performance (for example Sandstrom, Kaufman, &amp; Huettel, 1998; Saucier et al., 2002) this study sought to contribute to the growing body of literature on methods of training to increase sense of direction (such as Hund and Minarik, 2006; Hund &amp; Nazarczuk, 2009). An experimental procedure was used to investigate the possibility that the provision of reliable cardinal direction heading updates to participants would lead to a dual strategy for orientation in those that usually use a single strategy based on landmarks. This was done in an urban navigation context, with the main dependent variable being level of recall for route structure. Using the Santa Barbara Sense of Direction Scale, the study revealed that males had a higher self-reported sense of direction than females.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wayfinding strategies, sense of direction, cardinal directions, navigation, sex differences</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/8505</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutrition of container grown plants with emphasis on the Proteaceae</field><field name="creator">Thomas, M. B.</field><field name="description">A range of Proteaceous shrubs and other nursery plants were grown in containers with soilless media and various N levels. Plants demonstrated a range of responsiveness. Supplying soilless media with Osmocote (26% N) and other short term fertilisers proved to be a satisfactory method of studying the comparative nutrition of a wide range of container grown nursery plants using factorial experiments incorporating N, P, K and lime. Nutrient response surfaces were obtained using a central composite incomplete block design.  Most Proteaceous shrubs were intolerant of high P levels due to excessive luxury consumption resulting in toxic foliar nutrient levels, especially in the presence of high N.  Phosphorus sensitivity in plants appeared to correspond with the soil nutrient levels in their native habitat. This applied to species studied in the 2 main sub-families in the Proteaceae while similar findings were indicated for other Australian genera.  A range of optimum N requirements in the Proteaceae was found &#8211; lowest needs for Protea which also had the greatest tolerance of very low fertiliser additions, compared to Grevillea robusta with much higher N requirements and strong foliage growth inhibition if nutrient levels are very low.  Proteoid root growth on Grevillea rosmarinifolia only occurred at low nutrient levels and was not required for satisfactory foliage growth of container grown plants.  Pot plants and seedlings, especially tomato, responded strongly to N and often there were positive NK interactions influencing foliage growth. Lime requirements were studied and in erica increasing lime rates depressed foliage growth.  Comparative nutrition studies indicate that general or broad spectrum container media may be unsuitable for some groups of nursery plants and that they could be replaced by potting mixes designed to meet the widely differing needs of the species often grown. The number of specialist mixes would depend on the range of plants and be governed by management considerations.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Proteaceae</field><field name="subject">soilless media</field><field name="subject">nutrients</field><field name="subject">container grown</field><field name="subject">fertiliser</field><field name="subject">070601 - Horticultural Crop Growth and Development</field><field name="subject">079902 - Fertilisers and Agrochemicals (incl.

Estimates of regional crop loss may be inaccurate if the relationship between disease and yield loss is affected by crop yield potential. The importance of crop yield potential in disease: yield loss modelling was investigated and models for more accurate regional crop loss estimates were developed, taking crop yield potential into account.  Two spring sown barley (cv. Triumph) experiments were conducted in 1987/88 and 1988/89 in Canterbury, New Zealand, to study the effect of crop yield potential on the relationship between disease and yield loss. Crop yield potentials of 323 to 806gDM/m&#178; were generated in seven crops by varying nitrogen and water inputs, sowing date (mid-spring and early-summer) and season. Leaf rust (Puccinia hordei Otth) epidemics of different severity were generated by applying fungicides at different times, frequencies and rates to control the natural epidemics. Disease was measured as per cent disease severity (%DS), green leaf area, radiation interception and near-infrared radiation (NIR) reflectance from crop canopies. Yield was measured as total and grain dry weight.  Epidemics were severe in the fully diseased plots from GS 34 and 46 to maturity in the late and early sown crops respectively. Disease reduced grain yield by 50 to 63% in 1987/88 and 24 to 38% in 1988/89 in the fully diseased plots.  Disease: yield loss models were derived by regression analysis for each crop in 1987/88. Single point, multiple point and area under curve models were derived from %DS and GLAI variables, and proportional (%) and actual (gDM/m&#178;) grain yield. The effect of yield potential was determined by comparing regression equation coefficients for each crop with crop yield potential. An area under green leaf area index curve (AUGLAIC): actual yield model was best suited to determining the effect of yield potential on yield loss. This model was selected because AUGLAIC summarised the effect of disease on plant growth over the season and actual yield represented the crop yield potential in the absence of disease and the response of actual yield to disease. Crop yield potential did not affect actual yield loss caused by leaf rust.  Disease measured as AUGLAIC explained most of the variation in yield (R&#178;adj=0.93) for all crops in both years. Assessment of GLAI is not suitable for estimation of regional crop loss because of the requirement for a rapid and low cost method. Reflectance of NIR from the crop canopy was investigated as an alternative to GLAI measurements. Reflectance was correlated significantly (P&lt;0.001) with GLAI (r=0.66 to 0.89) and green area index (r=0.76 to 0.92). Reflectance measured at grain-filling (GS 85-87) explained most (R&#178;adj=0.94) of the variation in yield for all crops in both years.  The relationship between AUGLAIC and yield was validated with data from independent diseased and healthy barley crops. The AUGLAIC: yield model described the effects of disease on yield accurately but overestimated yield by 49 to 108% in the healthy crops. Models based on accumulated PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) intercepted by green leaves explained the observed deviations in yield of these crops from the AUGLAIC: yield model. Accumulated PAR models accounted for differences in incident radiation, canopy structure, radiation interception by green leaves, radiation use efficiency and harvest index which are important in determining dry matter production and grain yield. Accumulated PAR models described the effects of disease on crop growth which were not represented by GLAI alone.  Variation in crop yield potential at the regional scale is important in disease: yield loss modelling and can be accounted for by using either separate equations for each yield potential crop or crop category, robust models, inclusion of a form function for yield potential or choice of disease and yield variables which integrate yield potential.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">barley</field><field name="subject">Hordeum vulgare L.</field><field name="subject">leaf rust</field><field name="subject">Puccinia hordei</field><field name="subject">yield loss assessment</field><field name="subject">yield potential</field><field name="subject">disease assessment</field><field name="subject">green leaf area</field><field name="subject">reflectance</field><field name="subject">disease models</field><field name="subject">060704 - Plant Pathology</field><field name="subject">070308 - Crop and Pasture Protection (Pests, Diseases and Weeds)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1980</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sireline variation in neonatal lamb cold tolerance</field><field name="creator">Gudex, B. W.</field><field name="description">The cost of lamb mortality caused by cold exposure has been estimated at approximately 40 million dollars per year. This value is probably conservative as it does not include the cost due to the reduction in productivity in hypothermic lambs that manage to survive or the cost of reduced selection potential incurred by fewer lambs surviving until selection. The objectives of this research was to investigate whether sire-line variation exists in neonatal lamb cold tolerance and whether polymorphism in the &#946;&#8323; adrenergic receptor gene can be used as a genetic marker for lamb cold tolerance and lean muscle growth. The influence of the climate, birthweight, age of dam at lambing, gender and birth rank on neonatal lamb cold tolerance was also analysed. Neonatal lamb mortality due to cold exposure was analysed in four field trials that used neonatal lamb morality from cold exposure as a predictor of neonatal lamb cold tolerance. Sire-line variation in neonatal lamb morality was observed in all trials, though it appeared that this effect was largely mediated through sire-line variation in lamb birth weight. Variation in lamb birth weight between birth rank classed was also found to be responsible for the influence of birth rank on neonatal lamb mortality due to cold exposure. The age of dam at lambing and the lamb gender was not observed to influence neonatal lamb mortality due to cold exposure. The sires from the cold tolerance study and the progeny of the lean muscle growth study were genotyped for the &#946;&#8323; adrenergic receptor locus. Other studies have found evidence that a major gene exists in the catecholamine stimulation of brown adipose thermogenesis and evidence that the &#946;&#8323;-AR gene is a likely candidate. However, this hypothesis and the hypothesis that polymorphism in the &#946;&#8323;-AR gene is also linked to lean muscle growth in lambs was not confirmed in this study. So while it appears that the results were confounded by experimental design, there is evidence that influence of polymorphism in the ovine &#946;&#8323; AR gene on neonatal lamb mortality and/or lean muscle growth is not sufficient to be considered a major gene effect. The implications of this experiment on the sheep industry and sheep farmers in general are huge. While completely eliminating lamb deaths due to inadequate cold tolerance is impossible, this study shows that large gains in lamb survival could be possible through selective breeding.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sheep</field><field name="subject">Ovis aries</field><field name="subject">cold tolerance</field><field name="subject">lean muscle growth</field><field name="subject">birthweight</field><field name="subject">&#946;&#8323;-adrenergic receptor</field><field name="subject">Beta3 adrenergic receptor</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1055</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determining seed vigour in selected Brassica species</field><field name="creator">Leeks, C. R. F.</field><field name="description">Variables for the accelerated ageing (AA) test, methods for reducing fungal contamination during the AA test, using the conductivity test as a vigour test, the effect of seed size on seed vigour and the relationship between laboratory test results and field perfonnance in selected Brassica spp were investigated. In the first experiment, three seed lots of turnip rape hybrid (B. rapa x campestris), turnip (B. campestris) and forage rape (B. napus); and seven seed lots of Asian rape (B. napus), six seed lots of Asian kale (B. oleraceae var. alboglabra L.) and five seed lots of choisum (B. rapa var. pekinensis) with germinations above 90% were aged at two different temperatures (41 and 42&#176;C &#177; 0.3&#176;C) and three ageing times (24, 48 and 72 &#177; 15 minutes). The second experiment was divided into three sections. In the first, the same seed lots and species were aged at one temperature (41&#176;C) and time (72 h), but either 40 ml of saturated salts; KCl (83%RH), NaCl (76%RH), NaBr (55%RH); or distilled water (96%RH) were used as the ageing solutions. In the second, one turnip rape hyprid seed lot was aged at three temperatures (41, 42 and 45&#176;C) and two times (72 and 96h), again using the three saturated salts and distilled water as ageing solutions. In the third, three turnip rape hybrid seed lots and three Asian kale seed lots were surface sterilised (1 % sodium hypochlorite) prior to ageing at one temperature (41&#176;C) and time (72 h). In the third experiment, the same species and seed lots used in experiment one at their original seed moisture content (SMC) were tested for conductivity after soaking in deionised water for 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 h. They were then re-tested after the SMC had been adjusted to 8.5%. In the fourth experiment, three seed lots of forage rape and three seed lots of Asian kale were graded into three seed size categories; large (retained on a 2.0 mm screen), medium (retained on a 1.7 mm screen) and small (passed through a 1.7 mm screen). Graded seeds were then tested for standard germination, AA (41&#176;C/48 h) and conductivity (measured at 16 and 24 h). In the final experiment, the relationships between laboratory tests for the six species (each consisting of three seed lots), field emergence from three sowings, and cold room emergence were evaluated. Both time and temperature influenced post-AA germination. Increasing the ageing period from 48 to 72 hours at 41&#176;C, and 24 to 48 hours at 42&#176;C resulted in decreased mean germination percentage for all species but not always clear separation of seed lots. While there were sometimes few differences between ageing at 41&#176;C and 42&#176;C, the former is preferred because it is already the temperature used for other species. For Asian rape, choisum and turnip, the previously recommended testing conditions of 41&#176;C/72 h provided good seed lot separation, but for Asian kale and turnip rape hybrid, AA testing at 41&#176;C/48 h provided better results. Seed moisture content after ageing ranged from 29-37% depending on species. Fungal growth on seeds during the ageing period appeared to reduce post-ageing germination in some seed lots . Substituting saturated salts for distilled water did not stress seed lots in the AA test, due to the lowered RH%, the exception being seed lots 1210 and 1296. For forage and Asian species, seed lot germination mostly remained above 90% when aged for 72 h at lowered RH%. Increasing the ageing duration from 72 to 96 hours resulted in some decreases in post-AA germination but no clear separation of seed lots. Surface sterilising the seeds prior to the AA test resulted in a lower incidence of contaminant fungi which was associated with a lower percentage of abnormal seedlings. The conductivity test was mostly able to identify vigour differences among forage and Asian vegetable brassica seed lots. Differences in conductivity readings were observed among seed lots in all species. Increasing the period of imbibition resulted in increased conductivity from most seed lots but radicle emergence occurred after 16-20 h of imbibition. Variation was observed in the time to reach 95% maximum of the imbibition curve for most species. Conductivity readings at 16 h would avoid possible influences of radicle emergence on results. Adjusting the SMC to 8.5% resulted in reduced variation in conductivity among replicates of seed lots, due to a reduction in imbibition damage. Seed size had a significant effect on both post-AA germination and conductivity results. In forage rape, large size seeds had higher post-AA germination cf. medium cf. small size seeds. In Asian kale, large size seeds had higher post-AA germination compared with small size seeds. For both forage rape and Asian kale, large size seeds had lower conductivity readings cf. small size seeds. The correlation analyses demonstrated significant relationships between AA testing and field emergence parameters (percentage emergence, emergence index and emergence rate). Significant relationships were also observed between conductivity testing and these field emergence parameters. Based on the correlation analysis, AA testing at 41&#176;C/48 hand/or 42&#176;C/48 h could be recommended to be used as an AA test for turnip and Asian rape; and 41&#176;C/48 hand/or 41&#176;C/72 h for Asian kale and choisum. Based on the correlation analysis, conductivity testing at 16 h can be used to predict the field emergence potential of forage and Asian vegetable seed lots. Vigour tests were consistently able to provide better indicators of field perfonnance than the standard germination test, although these relationships did vary with the different field sowings.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brassica</field><field name="subject">seedling vigour</field><field name="subject">fungal contamination</field><field name="subject">germination</field><field name="subject">field emergence</field><field name="subject">accelerated ageing</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production::300203 Plant improvement (selection, breeding and genetic engineering)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1274</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wetland conservation in Canterbury, New Zealand : human-nature relationships and participation in local environmental groups</field><field name="creator">Sieber, Tara L.</field><field name="description">Wetlands are defined by New Zealand's Resource Management Act 1991 as "includ[ing] permanently or intermittently wet areas, shallow water and land water margins that support a natural ecosystem of plants and animals that are adapted to wet conditions" (RMA 1991). Over ninety per cent of New Zealand wetlands have been lost or modified. Several conservation groups composed of volunteers have formed to protect the few remaining areas. These wetlands and their conservators serve as an interesting study into human-nature relationships because of the precarious state of the ecosystems and the dedicated, local volunteer groups that form around them. I explored the relationship between the two through the 'soft systems tradition', which places importance on a human constructed "system of interest" (Oreszczyn 2000, p.109) in order to answer three research questions: How can the relationship between members of the wetland conservation groups and the wetlands they preserve be described; What 'triggers' people's participation and involvement in local environmental groups dedicated to wetland preservation and restoration; How do the groups advocate for wetlands and does the government play a role in this advocacy?  Using cultural models (Kempton et al. 1995), I argued that definitions and representations of nature are contested. Notions of place and dwelling, of actor-network theory (Cloke and Jones 2002), and of enclosure/restoration (Watts 2004, Elliot 1986), help to explain how people form their representations of nature within wetlands. Social capital theory (Putnam 2000) helped explain participants' involvement in wetland groups. Participants were involved in the wetland protection groups in order to express personal values, skills and identity through the group (Bishop and Hoggett 1986). Most individuals had a high sense of agency, and joined a wetland protection group because they believed that collective action is more effective than individual action (Taylor 2000, Horvath 1999). Groups that meet regularly and frequently, such as the Travis Wetland Trust, have more cohesive inter-personal bonds and individuals are more committed to the group than groups that meet infrequently (Lawler et al. 2000, Lawler 2001, 2002). This connection between group activities and positive emotion (Lawler 2002) explains why most members of the Travis Wetland Trust identified group involvement as the most important aspect of their involvement. In contrast, Otipua Wetland groups' members, who are divided between the Otipua Wetland Charitable Trust Board and the Friends of the Otipua Wetland, were more likely to name restoration or service as their primary reason for involvement in the group. Advocacy was considered part of group action, although it was not officially included in either group's objectives. Individuals believed they advocated in three ways: through education activities, communication regarding the wetland and through the restoration of the work itself. Individual advocacy translates into group advocacy, since the groups are viewed as vehicles for furthering individual concerns, and acting as a group gives a better chance of achieving results (Horvath 1999). The government played a role in both groups, and all parties maintained a positive working relationship with local government. A cooperative relationship with governments is essential for increasing public awareness of wetlands (Horvath 1999).</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nature</field><field name="subject">human-nature relationships</field><field name="subject">advocacy</field><field name="subject">local environmental groups</field><field name="subject">wetlands</field><field name="subject">Canterbury</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">enclosure</field><field name="subject">restoration</field><field name="subject">place and dwelling</field><field name="subject">productive exchange</field><field name="subject">160802 - Environmental Sociology</field><field name="subject">060204 - Freshwater Ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/2020</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Semiclassical Lp Estimates for Quasimodes on Submanifolds</field><field name="creator">Tacy, Melissa Evelyn</field><field name="description">Motivated by the desire to understand classical-quantum correspondences, we study  concentration phenomena   of approximate eigenfunctions of a semiclassical pseudodifferential operator $P(h)$.  Such eigenfunctions appear as steady state solutions of quantum  systems. Here we think of $h$  as being a small parameter such that $h^{2}$ is inversely proportional to the energy of such a system. As we understand classical mechanics to be the high energy (or small $h$) limit of quantum mechanics we expect the behaviour of eigenfunctions $u(h)$ for small $h$ to be related to properties of the associated classical system. In particular we study the connection between the classical flow and the quantum concentration properties. 

The  flow, $(x(t),\xi(t))$, of a classical system describes the system's motion through phase space where $x(t)$ is interpreted as position and $\xi(t)$ is interpreted as momentum. In the quantum regime we think of an eigenfunction as being composed of highly localised packets moving along bicharacteristics of the classical flow. With this intuition we relate concentration of eigenfunctions in a region to the time spent by projections of bicharacteristics there.

 We use the $L^{p}$ norm of $u$ when restricted to submanifolds as a measure of concentration. A high $L^{p}$ norm particularly for small $p$ is indicative of concentration near the submanifold. 


We reduce the estimates on eigenfunctions to operator norm estimates on associated evolution operators. Using the semiclassical analysis methods developed in Chapter 3 we express these evolution operators as oscillatory integral operators. Chapter 2 covers the technical background needed to work with such operators. In Chapter 4 we determine eigenfunction estimates for eigenfunctions restricted to a smooth embedded submanifold $Y$ of arbitrary dimension. If $Y$ is a hypersurface, the greatest concentration occurs when there are bicharacteristics of the classical flow embedded in $Y$. In Chapter 5 we assume that projections of such bicharacteristics can  be at worst simply tangent to $Y$ and thereby obtain better results for small values of $p$.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">eigenfunction estimate</field><field name="subject">restriction to submanifold</field><field name="subject">semiclassical analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20100622.150105</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD.

The biography of Crawford Munro (1904-76) describes his early life in Toowoomba and Sydney, and his maturation as an engineer, working for Sydney Water, Sydney Technical College and in the production of Cruiser tanks in World War II. He was a large confident man with a big voice and an optimistic, humorous personality. As the Foundation Professor of Civil Engineering at the University of New South Wales Munro was liberal, fostered humanist studies and developed the School of Engineering with a unique emphasis on water engineering. He recruited excellent staff for research and postgraduate education who led the nation across all phases of hydrology and hydraulics. Munro developed a remarkable, rational solution for flood mitigation at Launceston, and actively promoted research, partly through the Australian Water Research Foundation and the Institution of Engineers, Australia. He was much involved with predicting flood runoff, developing benefit/cost relations for irrigation schemes, which led him into public controversy, and other hydrological projects. Munro&#8217;s attempts to raise social consciousness about water problems, his multi-disciplinary approach to the evaluation of water resources and his campaigns for the collection of stream and rainfall data helped provide a better basis for proper planning. In his later years he undertook the first Australian environmental impact study. The concluding chapter outlines a vision for the current management of Australia&#8217;s water. Munro posed necessary questions about measuring the supply of water and bringing the demand of water into synchrony with its supply, while providing water security in terms of its availability and quality. He raised the debate about the balance between sustaining environmental flows, utilizing water for agriculture and secondary industry, and maintaining the health of communities. Munro hoped equitable decision making would emerge from public engagement on these issues. 2. Twentieth century science biography in Australia is the province of a group of elite male scientists, whose interests cover wide disciplinary fields; it is focused on popular imagination: health, food and adventure (Antarctica) accounting for fifteen of the seventeen scientists. Empathy for the subject is a significant feature of the nineteen biographers, of whom five are scientists. This small genre is often supported by institutions in small print runs. A key role of biography is to place through science history a more epistemologically plausible version of events. Public discourses of science treated in the essay include conflict about the attribution of scientific discovery, the vocation of the scientist as a contributor to a wider social polity, the light biography sheds on sources of creativity and the evolution of the research and culture of institutions. The biographer attempts to generate a personal portrait of the scientist which conveys authority about the significance and origins of his or her scientific discoveries and their impact in the wider social context. Thomas S&#246;derqvist&#8217;s affirmation of the existential approach which &#8216;emphasizes the freedom and responsibility of the human individual&#8217; resonates with the candidate as expressing characteristics of the lives of many Australian scientists in their passion for intellectual discovery, their motivation to self-empowerment, and their readiness to step outside their social conditioning. This essay extends S&#246;derqvist&#8217;s paradigm to the context of Australian science biography and indicates some constraints on its depiction which arise in the practice of writing science biography. Some epistemological issues are raised in the texts, especially when dealing with oral history and family mythology, and thematic, thematic within a chronological framework or chronological structures of the text are compared. The level of detail and context influence the sustainability of the reader&#8217;s interest. Case studies of the biographies written by the candidate (Ian Clunies Ross, Samuel Wadham, Allan Callaghan, Victor Trikojus, Raymond Hoffenberg and Crawford Munro) illustrate issues which arise in the writing of science biography. The dominant question is the relationship of the biographer to the subject, and this determines the voice the reader hears. The motivation of the biographer may arise in varying degrees of empathy felt for the subject. The high affinity the candidate had for Clunies Ross and Hoffenberg causes him to offer a defence against the charge of hagiography, and the selectivity and subjectivity of the biographer is evident in the arrangement and presentation of factual material. The motivation of the biographer is additionally directed to the communication of the subject&#8217;s research outputs to the wider Australian community, and in the case of Callaghan, Wadham and Clunies Ross there was a specific programmatic function of advancing the status of agricultural science. It is argued that the description of the public life of the subject needs to be complemented from the private life if the biographer is &#8216;to view the world through the eyes of the subject&#8217;.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">science biography, epistemology, history, science institutions, munro, water, hydrology, environmental sustainability, irrigation, planning</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:195937</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical Simulation of a Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Reservoir in the Cooper Basin, South Australia</field><field name="creator">Bronwyn Muller</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the development and production of numerical simulations of the creation of a Hot Dry Rock (HDR) geothermal reservoir. This geothermal reservoir that was simulated is owned by Geodynamics Limited and is located in the Cooper Basin, South Australia. The simulations show the geometry of the geothermal reservoir and predict the productive lifespan of the reservoir. Geothermal energy, which is the thermal energy that is stored in the interior of the earth, is an enormous energy source and as such there is great interest in technology that allows this energy to be harnessed. The HDR process of extracting the geothermal energy from rock involves drilling a borehole to a suitable depth and injecting cold water into the rock via this well (known as the injection well) to create a reservoir by opening up fractures in the rock. As water is forced through the reservoir, heat is extracted from the rock via conduction and transferred to the water, creating an heat exchange. Warm water is brought to the surface via another well known as the extraction well. The heat from the water is used to generate electricity and then the water is fed back into the injection well, completing the cycle. The creation of a HDR geothermal reservoir comprises of many aspects: the injection of the fluid into the jointed rock system, the opening and shearing of the joints, the creation of the fluid reservoir in the rock and the temperature effects of the fluid flow through the joints. This work incorporates all of these aspects. Due to the multi-physics nature of this process multiple computational modelling strategies were implemented to allow for authentic simulation of the entire process. The mechanical rock behaviour was primarily simulated the Distinct Element Method. This two dimensional Distinct Element Method program allowed for a realistically scaled model of the whole geothermal reservoir to be developed. This model was particularly useful for modelling the joint behaviour as the discrete nature of this method compares well with the joint system on such a scale. A discrete particle based model was used to model the joint behaviour on a small scale. These models demonstrated the behaviour of joints under compressional strain, showing slip and the effects of joint dilatancy. The productive lifespan of the geothermal reservoir was modelled using a Finite Element Method program based on Darcy's Law and an height-averaged heat equation. The aim of this model was to simulate the effects on the rock temperature of the fluid flow through the reservoir. The lifespan of the reservoir with differing well geometries was tested using this model to show which geometry would extend the productive lifetime of the geothermal reservoir. The results produced from the DEM models showed that the reservoir geometry is very much dependent upon the joint angle, and under the Cooper Basin stress regime steeper joints will be more likely to open. Joint dilatancy also affects the fluid flow rates as the amount of joint opening is dependent upon the joint dilatancy angle. The modelling of the temperature drawdown of the rock due to the fluid flow showed that a square configuration of wells is the ideal configuration to prolong the productive lifespan of the HDR geothermal reservoir. Results produced with the modelling parameters provided by Geodynamics Limited indicate that the productive lifespan of the Cooper Basin HDR geothermal reservoir created is approximately 50 years. This reservoir is only one of many that can be created at the site to prolong the productivity of the energy plant. The combined results of this modelling strategy give an overall image of the creation and lifetime of the HDR geothermal energy plant in the Cooper Basin.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260000 Earth Sciences</field><field name="subject">HDR</field><field name="subject">geothermal</field><field name="subject">Cooper Basin</field><field name="subject">Geodynamics</field><field name="subject">finite element</field><field name="subject">distinct element</field><field name="subject">Escript</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206571</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Associations of patterns of daily life, physical fitness and body composition of primary school age children</field><field name="creator">Kira, Geoffrey Dean Juranovich</field><field name="description">The daily patterns of life, for example, food, physical activity and inactivity and sleep as well as physical fitness are associated with the accumulation of excess body fat in children. A positive energy balance between food (energy intake) and metabolism, particularly physical activity (energy output) is the accepted explanation. The reality of daily life for children is excessive calorie consumption, imbalances in macronutrient intake and missed opportunities for activity are being driven by the physical and social environment. Excess body fat tracks into adulthood and is associated with decreased insulin sensitivity, which may lead to increased risk of insulin resistance and chronic disease. Resting metabolic rate and substrate utilisation (measured by respiratory exchange ratio) are implicated in the prediction of weight gain in adults, but these relationships have been rarely explored in children. Both insulin and respiratory exchange provide insights into the pathways of accumulation of body fat. The purpose of this body of work presented here was to explore and explain how lifestyle patterns, substrate metabolism, physical fitness attributes and insulin resistance are related to excess body fat accumulation in children. &#8220;Project Energize&#8221; is a Waikato District Health Board-initiated through-school nutrition and physical activity intervention, operated in a growing number of primary schools throughout the Waikato. Data was collected from Project Energize control and programme schools between 2004 and 2006. The children that participated in this body of work were aged between 5 and 12 years of age (20% M&#257;ori). Fat mass (FM) change in Hamilton and Waikato primary school age children over a two year period is reported in study one (n=618). Study two (n=69) and three (n=169) are cross-sectional sub-studies of low decile schools (&lt;3) that employ two methods of metabolic assessment; indirect calorimetry and glucose homeostasis; to investigate the relationships between food, activity, fitness with body composition and metabolic risk. More than 70% of the increase in body mass index (BMI) and percentage body fat (PBF) could be explained by the same measures two years earlier and more than 10% of the reported food, activity and sleep behaviours were able to be predicted from the responses two years earlier. There were no clear associations found with resting respiratory exchange ratio (RER), but resting metabolic rate (RMR) was best explained (45%) by fat free mass with a further 3% explained by cardiorespiratory fitness. Children with longer legs (as represented by height) travelled further, but FM attenuated final speed. Children with more fat had higher insulin resistance. Physical fitness was not associated with insulin resistance. Overall, a pattern of increased FM was linked to: 1. FM two years previously 2. a lesser speed attained in the 20m Shuttle Run Test and 3. higher insulin resistance. A focus on weight gain rather than change in FM and FFM, fitness and metabolic markers as the outcome of interventions is unlikely to show short or medium term changes. Therefore it is recommended that when instigating school-based nutrition and physical activity programmes, there must also be a focus on the daily patterns of life alongside community, family and culture-based partnerships to support sustainable behavioural change.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en_NZ</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">nutrition</field><field name="subject">physical activity</field><field name="subject">body composition</field><field name="subject">physical fitness</field><field name="subject">insulin sensitivity</field><field name="subject">primary school</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/930</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The value of direct and indirect written corrective feedback for intermediate ESL students</field><field name="creator">Lu, Yang</field><field name="description">This study looks at the effectiveness of direct and indirect written corrective feedback (WCF) when using them with 26 intermediate ESL learners&#8217; writings. The study also investigates whether giving the learners the type of feedback they preferred or less preferred would influence their actual performance. WCF, a pedagogy that is often used when helping learners improve their written accuracy, has captured researchers&#8217; attention in recent decades. Truscott (1996) claimed that WCF is ineffective and suggested teachers should abandon it. Therefore, in the early studies, researchers concentrated on examining the effectiveness of WCF, in order to justify the value of using WCF. In recent studies, researchers have proved that WCF is effective in certain contexts, and they have also investigated the value of using different types of WCF, and the value of using it over time. Moreover, in order to help learners to improve in written accuracy, recent studies in the field have also investigated whether WCF is more effective when used on a certain type of linguistic form/structure. With respect to different types of WCF, researchers in recent decades have also paid some attention to learner preference in WCF. However, the relationship between learner preference and the value of using the type of feedback learners prefer has not yet been investigated. In essence, the relationship between learner preference and their actual performance when using the type of feedback they preferred was examined in this study. The study also aimed to look at the effectiveness of WCF over time, and to investigate whether direct feedback or indirect feedback helped learners better. Furthermore, the study also aimed to investigate whether there was a certain type of linguistic form that WCF works best with. A quantitative approach was used in this study in order to show the results more clearly, and to provide statistical evidence on each finding. The study involved questionnaires, and three writing tests: pre-test, immediate post-test, and a delayed post-test. Before the learners did the pre-test, they were asked to complete a questionnaire to select their preferred type of feedback (direct feedback or indirect feedback). Based on their preferences on feedback, they were put into different groups. Group one received direct feedback; group two received indirect feedback; group three received the feedback they preferred (indirect feedback); group four received no linguistic feedback, but general commentaries on their writing were given. The participants (twenty-six students who enrolled in a general English program at AUT University) had completed the questionnaire and the three writing tests. Findings from the study revealed that, most of the learners preferred receiving direct feedback. When examining learner performance between those who received the type of feedback they preferred and those who did not, the former did not outperform than others. However, factors like different levels of scaffolding assistance may have affected the results. Other findings from the study revealed that WCF was effective overtime, especially when using it on errors of present simple tense. The study also found that indirect feedback was more effective than direct feedback. A possible factor that appeared to influence learners&#8217; performance was identified as learners&#8217; motivation in learning. The results of the study contribute to an understanding of the type of feedback that is most suitable for learners at intermediate level, and on which type of linguistic form WCF can work best with. Practical suggestions for pedagogy and further research are also made.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">written corrective feedback</field><field name="subject">direct and indirect WCF</field><field name="subject">linguistics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/929</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using emergent technologies to develop sustainable architectural composites</field><field name="creator">Palmer, Fleur</field><field name="description">The intention of this project is to research the potential of emergent technologies for developing sustainable composites for the building industry.

The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polymerisation and export of alginate in Pseudomanas aeruginosa : functional assignment and catalytic mechanism of Alg8/44 : a thesis presented to Massey University in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Microbiology</field><field name="creator">Remminghorst, Uwe</field><field name="description">Alginate biosynthesis is not only a major contributor to pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa but also an important factor in colonization of adverse environmental habitats by biofilm formation. The requirement of proteins Alg8 and Alg44, encoded by their respective genes in the alginate biosynthesis gene cluster, for alginate biosynthesis of P. aeruginosa was demonstrated, since deletion mutants were unable to produce or polymerise alginate. AlgX deletion mutants failed to produce the alginate characteristic mucoid phenotype, but showed low concentrations of uronic acid monomers in the culture supernatants. Complementation experiments using PCR based approaches were used to determine the complementing ORF and all deletion mutants could be complemented to at least wildtype levels by introducing a plasmid harbouring the respective gene. Increased copy numbers of Alg44 did not impact on the amount of alginate produced, whereas increased copy numbers of the alg8 gene led to an at least 10 fold stronger alginate production impacting on biofilm structure and stability. Topological analysis using reporter protein fusions and subsequent subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that Alg8 is located in the cytoplasmic membrane and contains at least 4 transmembrane helices, 3 of them at its C terminus. Its large cytosolic loop showed similarities to inverting glycosyltransferases and the similarities were used to generate a threading model using SpsA, a glycosyltransferase involved in spore coat formation of B. subtilis, as a template. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the importance of identified motifs commonly detected in glycosyltransferases. Inactivation of the DXD motif, which has been shown to be involved in nucleotide sugar binding, led to loss-offunction mutants of Alg8 and further replacements revealed putative candidates for the catalytic residue(s). Contradicting the commonly reported prediction of being a transmembrane protein, Alg44 was shown to be a periplasmic protein. The highest specific alkaline phosphatase activity of its fusion protein could be detected in the periplasmic fraction and not in the insoluble membrane fraction. Bioinformatical analysis of Alg44 revealed structural similarities of its N terminus to PilZ domains, shown to bind cyclic-di-GMP, and of its C terminus to MexA, a membrane fusion protein involved in multi-drug efflux systems. Thus, it was suggested that Alg44 has a regulatory role for alginate biosynthesis in bridging the periplasm and connecting outer and cytoplasmic membrane components. AlgX was shown to interact with MucD, a periplasmic serine protease or chaperone homologue, and is suggested to exert its impact on alginate production via MucD interaction. In vitro alginate polymerisation assays revealed that alginate production requires protein components of the outer and cytoplasmic membrane as well as the periplasm, and these data were used to construct a model describing a multi-enzyme, membrane and periplasm spanning complex for alginate polymerisation, modification and export.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pseudomonas aeruginosa</field><field name="subject">alginates</field><field name="subject">biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/735</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of milk protein ingredients on physico-chemical properties of rice starch : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology at Massey University Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Noisuwan, Angkana</field><field name="description">The overall aim of this thesis is to determine if the interactions between normal and waxy rice starch and milk proteins from four milk protein ingredients, namely skim milk powder (SMP), milk protein concentrate (MPC), sodium caseinate (NaCAS) and whey protein isolate (WPI) do occur, and to identify the mechanisms underlying these interactions. Different milk protein ingredients at various concentrations (0 to 10%, w/w) affected markedly and differently the pasting behaviour of 10% (w/w) rice starches. SMP delayed the pasting of both rice starches by increasing the onset temperature (Tonset) and the peak viscosity temperature (Tpeak) of pasting. This was mainly due to the presence of lactose and ions, which was further supported by the investigation of the effects of UFSMP (a solution of salts and lactose present in SMP at their proper concentration) and lactose. The addition of NaCAS also delayed the pasting of rice starch; Tpeak in the case of both starches was increased. For normal rice starch paste, MPC and WPI decreased the Tpeak. MPC had no affect on Tpeak of waxy rice starch paste. The qualitative viscoelastic behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient gels obtained from the above pastes was dominated by the continuous phase made of the starch molecules. There was evidence, as indicated by confocal microscopy, of phase separation between the milk proteins of SMP and MPC and the two starches. The phase separation was not observed in the addition of either NaCAS or WPI. Studies on the thermal behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient mixtures by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that SMP, similarly to UFSMP, delayed the gelatinization of both starches. NaCAS also delayed the gelatinisation of both starches but had a greater effect on waxy than normal rice starch. The addition of NaCAS did not affect Tonset but increased Tpeak for normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinisation temperature of waxy rice starch was highly affected by the addition of NaCAS with both Tonset and Tpeak shifted to higher temperatures. MPC had no affect on the gelatinization temperature of normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinization temperature of waxy rice starch was increased by the addition of MPC. The addition of WPI to both rice starches showed two thermal transitions. The first of these was due to the gelatinisation of the starches and the second to the denaturation of &#223;-lactoglobulin (&#223;-lg). The addition of WPI to normal rice starch showed that the thermal behaviour of normal starch and protein were independent from each other. In contrast, the thermal behaviour of waxy rice starch was modified by the addition of WPI; both Tonset and Tpeak were increased. SMP decreased the Tonset of swelling, swelling ratio and the amount of starch leaching from both starches. These observed changes were due to the presence of lactose and ions in SMP. NaCAS slightly increased Tonset of swelling but the amount of starch leaching was reduced for both rice starches. The rigidity of both starches tended to increase in the presence of NaCAS. MPC and WPI affected the swelling behaviour of normal and waxy rice starch differently. A dramatic increase in the swelling of normal rice starch/MPC or WPI mixtures was observed, whereas this trend was not evident for waxy rice starch/ MPC or WPI mixtures. The difference in the water holding ability and gelatinization peak temperatures of the two starches over the temperature range at which whey proteins denature and form gels are believed to be responsible for the observed differences. The results from confocal microscopy showed that milk proteins, such as a-casein, &#223;- casein, &#223;-lg and a-lactalbumin (a-la), were adsorbed onto the granule surface of both normal and waxy rice starch. The mechanism for this adsorption is the hydrophilic interactions; hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl group from terminated glucan molecule that protrude around starch granule surface-hydroxyl; amino, or other electron-donation or electron-accepting groups of the added proteins. Using sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) it was found that for SMP and MPC the adsorbed as- to &#223;-casein ratio on both starches was similar to the as-casein to &#223;- casein ratio in the casein micelle at low SMP and MPC concentrations. But at high concentrations of SMP or MPC, this ratio decreased indicating that more &#223;-casein was adsorbed preferentially to as-casein. In the case of NaCAS, as-casein was adsorbed preferentially to &#223;-casein. Moreover, there was evidence of multilayer adsorption of ascasein into the surface of rice starch granules.

While this is successful at rearing large numbers of birds for release to the wild, poor survivability of these birds is limiting significant increases in the wild population. Predation and starvation are suspected to be the most common causes of death in released birds, but underlying contributing factors to these mortalities have not been fully evaluated. This research investigates the possible contribution of gastrointestinal (GI) helminth burdens and suboptimal digestive organ development to the high mortality rates of released kak&#239;. Emphasis is placed on evaluating the methods used to assess the importance of these factors and to make informed recommendations for future management. The efficacy of the anthelmintic regime used for kak&#239; was assessed by dosing half of the 80 captive birds with praziquantel (PZQ) prior to release in 2007. Faecal samples were collected before and after anthelmintic treatment, and before and after release to the wild. Post mortem worm counts were conducted on 11 birds that died following release and historical worm count records dating back to 1997 were accessed. The main findings were: PZQ had high efficacy against trematodes; treatment did not prevent re-infection; birds were exposed to helminths at release site; and there was no advantage of treatment for survival. Overall, the results suggest that anthelmintic treatment is an unnecessary cost. Consequently, recommendations were made to cease anthelmintic treatment or reduce its intensity, continue health screening, and incorporate annual efficacy testing to monitor the emergence of anthelmintic resistance. The reliability of faecal screening for GI helminths was evaluated. Faecal egg counts (FECs) were found to be poor indicators of worm burden. The two modified sedimentation methods used to detect trematodes provided relatively low egg recovery rates. Trematode egg shedding varied between days but not by hour of the day or temperature. The collection and analysis of pooled faecal samples proved to be more cost and time-effective than samples from individual birds and the larger masses collected resulted in greater sensitivity. In conclusion, faecal analysis of pooled samples is a useful qualitative indicator of helminth presence or absence but is quantitatively unreliable. In order to assess the importance of digestive organ development to captive-reared and released kak?, the digestive organs of healthy and emaciated captive, released and wild Himantopus sp. were compared. Captive and released kak? had generally smaller digestive organs than wild birds, released birds did not increase digestive organ size to match the high fibre wild diet, and emaciated birds did not have atrophied organs. However, the greatest mortality rates occur soon after release, while the birds were still being supplementary fed. These results suggest that reduced digestive efficiency is probably not contributing significantly to mortality rates and the direct impacts of the translocation are probably greater risk factors. The continued provision of supplementary food to released birds and an increased focus on habitat enhancement and predator control at release sites were recommended. The reliability of comparing fresh and formalin fixed Himantopus sp. gut specimens was evaluated. Significant differences in fresh and formalin fixed organ dry masses and variation in preserved organ lengths indicate that this variation should be considered in future studies. In conclusion, current management practices appear to be successful in ensuring that GI helminths and reduced digestive efficiency do not significantly lower the survivorship of captive-reared and released kak&#239;. There is a need for further research into developing a more direct physiological assessment of the impacts of GI helminths and gut morphology as well as considering the role that starvation may have on poor survivability.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">black stilt</field><field name="subject">captive management</field><field name="subject">endangered species</field><field name="subject">gastrointestinal helminth</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300805 Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1001</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accelerating classifier training using AdaBoost within cascades of boosted ensembles : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Sciences at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Susnjak, Teo</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to address current problems encountered when training classifiers within the framework of cascades of boosted ensembles (CoBE). At present, a signifi- cant challenge facing this framework are inordinate classifier training runtimes. In some cases, it can take days or weeks (Viola and Jones, 2004; Verschae et al., 2008) to train a classifier. The protracted training runtimes are an obstacle to the wider use of this framework (Brubaker et al., 2006). They also hinder the process of producing effective object detection applications and make the testing of new theories and algorithms, as well as verifications of others research, a considerable challenge (McCane and Novins, 2003). An additional shortcoming of the CoBE framework is its limited ability to train clas- sifiers incrementally. Presently, the most reliable method of integrating new dataset in- formation into an existing classifier, is to re-train a classifier from beginning using the combined new and old datasets. This process is inefficient. It lacks scalability and dis- cards valuable information learned in previous training. To deal with these challenges, this thesis extends on the research by Barczak et al. (2008), and presents alternative CoBE frameworks for training classifiers. The alterna- tive frameworks reduce training runtimes by an order of magnitude over common CoBE frameworks and introduce additional tractability to the process. They achieve this, while preserving the generalization ability of their classifiers. This research also introduces a new framework for incrementally training CoBE clas- sifiers and shows how this can be done without re-training classifiers from beginning. However, the incremental framework for CoBEs has some limitations. Although it is able to improve the positive detection rates of existing classifiers, currently it is unable to lower their false detection rates.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CoBE framework</field><field name="subject">classifiers</field><field name="subject">classification algorithms</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280212 Neural networks, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1002</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The physiological effects of pseudoephedrine on endurance cycling : a thesis submitted in the partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Sport and Exercise Science, Massey University (Palmerston North, New Zealand)</field><field name="creator">Mouatt, Joshua Roger</field><field name="description">Background: Pseudoephedrine (PSE) is a mild central nervous system stimulant that when consumed at a high dosage has the potential to alter physiological and psychophysical responses. PSE is widely accessible as over-the-counter medication and despite limited research into PSE at high dosages or its effects on prolonged exercise (&gt;2 hours) is no-longer on the World Anti-Doping Association&#8217;s banned substance list. Currently unrestricted in sport and with no real understanding of the abovementioned responses during endurance exercise there is a high potential for abuse in sport. A recent study performed in our laboratory found PSE to improve self-paced cycling performance in some individuals, however no physiological measurements were taken Purpose: The primary purpose of this study was to determine the physiological effects of PSE at a dosage previously shown to improve performance (2.5 mg/kg) in some individuals during prolonged cycling. A secondary purpose of this study was to assess the effect on endurance cycling performance. Methods: In a randomized, double-blind and counter-balanced design, ten welltrained cyclists participated in two trials, consisting of 120 min of fixed-intensity cycling at 65% VO2max followed by a set work, self-paced time-trial (TT) of ~30 min, following ingestion of either 2.5 mg/kg PSE or visual-matched glucose placebo. Venous blood samples were collected before and during exercise, along with body temperatures and heart rate. Perceived effort and expired gas samples were collected during exercise. Exercise and diet was controlled ~48-hours prior to the trials. Results: Mean heart rate was significantly higher with PSE (P = 0.028) during fixed-intensity exercise. Blood glucose concentrations were significantly lower with PSE (P &lt;0.001) for the first 40 min of fixed-intensity exercise. Respiratory exchange ratio was lower in the final 20-min of fixed-intensity and TT with PSE. Blood lactate, perceived effort, ventilation, and body temperatures were not significantly different between conditions during exercise, nor was TT performance; however individual response was variable. Conclusions: PSE ingestion increased heart rate during endurance cycling and initially suppressed carbohydrate release into the bloodstream while increasing fat oxidation in the later stages of exercise. Despite individual responses, endurance cycling performance remained unchanged with PSE ingestion.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cycling performance</field><field name="subject">physiological measurements</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321400 Human Movement and Sports Science::321401 Exercise physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1013</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Youth development, Maui styles : Kia tipu te rito o te pa harakeke, Tikanga and ahuatanga as a basis for a positive Maori youth development approach : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Maori Studies at Te Kunenga ki Purehuroa Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ware, Felicity Jane Rachel</field><field name="description">The Youth Development Strategy Aotearoa has been seen as an innovative approach to youth development. The E tipu e rea &#8211; Rangatahi Development Package was particularly useful for organisations implementing the strategy with Maori youth. There have been successful Maori youth development initiatives, though these have been ad hoc. Nonetheless, the realities and experiences of Maori youth are still not being fully addressed in national policy. This has implications for the support and resourcing of Maori youth development initiatives. Maori youth are members of a range of groups including whanau, hapu, iwi and Maori communities in te ao Maori as well as the wider youth population and New Zealand society. The histories, experiences and viewpoints of each distinct group contribute to diversity in the Maori youth population which presents challenges for Maori youth development. Maori development goals do not adequately focus on Maori youth and youth development theory does not fully consider culture. The challenge is to successfully integrate Maori culture and youth culture in a relevant and meaningful manner so that Maori youth can positively contribute to Maori development and wider New Zealand society. This study examines purakau (narratives) about Maui (Polynesian ancestor) as a template for the analysis of Maori youth development. Interviews were undertaken with a group of Maori youth from the Manawatu region. The research showed tikanga and ahuatanga were relevant to the contemporary daily lives of the participants. The study found that positive development and the realisation of potential for Maori youth was affected by individual and environmental influences. This thesis concludes by making recommendations for policy, practice and further research. Finally, it offers a culturally appropriate theoretical approach for positive Maori youth development.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori youth</field><field name="subject">purakau</field><field name="subject">narratives</field><field name="subject">youth policy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology::370102 Social policy and planning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1152</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality assessment and ethnicity : a New Zealand study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand.

To date there has only been two published studies that have used New Zealand relevant ethnic groups when analysing whether personality measures used in pre-employment settings exhibit different mean scores. The present thesis performed a systematic evaluation on the impact of ethnicity on personality traits. The study examined the impact of ethnicity on NZ Army Officer applicant personality assessment scores measured by the EPQ-R and GPP-I. Four ethnic groups (NZ Europeans, M&#226;ori, Pasifika, and Asian) were analysed for mean trait score differences among ethnic groups, the stability of these differences across different personality inventories and models, the variance of personality traits, the impact of ethnicity on age and gender relationships with personality traits, and how these differences were related to employment selection outcomes. The analyses revealed that ethnicity did have some impact on mean personality assessment scores used in the study. However, these were mostly small differences among ethnic groups. In addition, most of these differences found on the EPQ-R and the GPP-I were not consistent across inventories and models. There were no significant variance differences found on personality traits among ethnic groups. While initial analysis suggested that ethnicity did not influence the relationship between age and gender on personality assessment, further examination suggested that the relationship between gender and personality was impacted on by ethnicity. There were reassuring results found for New Zealand psychologists and HR specialists, as only two of the twelve traits analysed showed moderate differences on traits that were related to selection outcomes. However, for the NZ Army OSB selection process the findings in the present study indicate that the Lie scale on the EPQ-R and the Vigor trait on the GPP-I may need to be interpreted with caution for Asian and Pasifika groups. These results are discussed in terms of implications for personality theory, measurement, and the direction of future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personality assessment</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised</field><field name="subject">EPQ-R</field><field name="subject">Gordon Personal Profile - Inventory</field><field name="subject">GPP-I</field><field name="subject">ethnic status</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1188</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies in anaerobic/aerobic treatment of dairy shed effluent : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Agricultural Engineering at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Warburton, David John</field><field name="description">Increases in herd size and enforcement of water quality regulations have created an effluent disposal problem for the New Zealand dairy industry. Spray disposal to land and lagooning are commonly used but mechanical failures, management requirements and pressure on land have limited their suitability in many situations. This project was established to consider an alternative system. Initial studies revealed that anaerobic treatment in unmixed, non-insulated tanks, followed by trickling filter aeration, might be suitable. Two laboratory scale and one field treatment plant (1/15 - 1/20 full scale) were constructed to investigate the system. A factorial experimental design allowed investigation into three anaerobic treatment levels with a 3 x 3 aerobic treatment interaction nested within each anaerobic treatment. Anaerobic residence times of 5, 7.5 and 10 days provided loading rates of 1.35 - 0.63 kg COD/m3-day and 1.36 - 0.67 kg T S/m3-day. Removals between inlet and outlet averaged 71% and were insensitive to loading rate. Total solids accumulation rates of 40-50% TS input rate suggests that anaerobic tank design should be based on solids accumulation rate and cleaning frequency. The stone media trickling filter was loaded at approximately 0.61 kg COD/m3-day. Aeration periods of 1, 2 and 3 days and hydraulic loads of 2.8, 10.1 and 18.2 m3/m2-day were studied to determine their influence on treatment efficiency. Multiple regression analysis indicated that the longer residence times and higher recycle rates improved treatment efficiency. Removals varied with the measured parameters but ranged from 42-66% for COD. Design alterations to allow the final discharge to be taken from the bottom of the filter, after settling, would increase aerobic treatment efficiency above 75% COD removal. Prediction of treatment efficiencies beyond the monitored operating conditions suggested that only marginal improvements could be made. The TS accumulation rate in the aerobic phase was approximately 13% of the TS input rate or 56% of the BOD removal rate. Overall plant treatment efficiencies of 80-89% were obtained. Removals in excess of 92% could be achieved with minor design alterations. Maintenance and operational requirements were minimal. The only problem with the system was an average 15 fold increase in NO3-N and 4 fold increase in DIP under conditions for optimum removal of the other parameters. Intermittent land disposal could reduce this problem. Treatment comparison between similar laboratory plants, and between laboratory and field plants which varied by a scale factor of 56, suggests that identically designed plants would give a similar performance and that there is little scale effect. Increasing the scale only improved treatment efficiencies under unstable aerobic conditions, i.e., high recycle rates and low residence times. Increasing scale gave some decrease in maintenance and operational problems. Design of a full scale plant, based on daily pollution loads from a 250 cow dairy shed, suggests that the system is a viable proposition.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Milking parlors</field><field name="subject">Waste disposal</field><field name="subject">Dairy shed effluent</field><field name="subject">Anaerobic treatment</field><field name="subject">Agricultural Engineering</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::299900 Other Engineering and Technology::299901 Agricultural engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1400</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sell-side analysts' use and communication of intellectual capital information</field><field name="creator">Abhayawansa, Subhash Asanga</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intellectual capital</field><field name="subject">Sell-side analysts</field><field name="subject">Non-financial information</field><field name="subject">analyst reports</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/6260</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">It's like having to trade on the personal : changing work, changing identities of public health learning and development practitioners.</field><field name="creator">Wilkins, Rob</field><field name="description">As a practitioner involved in the planning and development of educational activities in the field of public health, I have worked within many pedagogical traditions and program parameters. Through this work, I have experienced both subtle and radical shifts in the range of skills, knowledge and relationships required to collaboratively plan and evaluate educational work. In this professional and community-based landscape, competing and often overlapping models of education and evaluation have led to much conceptual confusion and ambiguity around narrowly defined notions of best practice, evidence and knowledge legitimacy. Drawing from Dorothy Smith&#8217;s (1999) standpoint theory from which my inquiry was developed as a result of my participation with colleagues in the field, I explore how three professional practice networks of learning and development practitioners speak of the skills, knowledge, relationships and worker identities in a changing field. This research seeks to explicate the kinds of informal and largely unarticulated knowledge that is produced through the changing contexts of work. This research maps the changing conditions of educational work through my own case stories of educational practice and uses these as a springboard for discussion among three diverse professional practice networks. The Story/Dialogue Method (S/D-M) developed by Labonte and Feather (1996), is a constructivist methodological approach that, in this application, structures group dialogue into reflective insights and theories about how educational work occurs in varied settings among different professional and community-based groups. A strong reliance on interpersonal skills was articulated by all three networks to build trust, assess individual and organisational learning needs, to build partnerships and to motivate learners. Skills were often described vaguely and summarised as a series of situational specific attributes. A valuing of reflexive, working knowledge as opposed to professional or discipline-based expertise was raised as an important aspect of partnership building and in negotiating program parameters. The need to build individual and organisational relationships through formal and informal encounters was cited as a series of legitimate yet often &#8216;behind the scenes&#8217; professional practices. Aligning with the notion of worker identity described by Chappell, Rhodes, Solomon, Tennant and Yates (2003) as process, practitioners spoke of their identities as constructed and temporary, negotiated through newly emerging roles and changing relationships with peers and learners. This study suggests that evidence-based practice is a contested term drawing its meanings from multiple theoretical and pedagogical traditions including that of intuition. Perhaps unsurprisingly then, evidence guiding educational approaches is viewed as a pragmatic and eclectic mix of tools stored to be adapted for use in new ways. Additionally, this study concludes that all participants (including myself) regard educational practice as a collaborative and continually negotiated endeavour.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">health practitioners</field><field name="subject">health promotion</field><field name="subject">public health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/368</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Habitat requirements and habitat use of the red-crowned toadlet Pseudophryne Australis and the giant burrowing frog Heleioporus Australiacus in the Sydney basin.</field><field name="creator">Stauber, Andrew G.</field><field name="description">Habitat requirements and habitat use for Pseudophryne australis and Heleioporus australiacus were investigated to aid management of these threatened frogs around Sydney, Australia. Much of the work focussed on roads, commonly encountered features in the habitat of both species. The habitat requirements based on locality records of both frogs in the Sydney Basin were investigated at four spatial scales. Both species are habitat specialists. They showed a strong geological association with Hawkesbury Sandstone and occupy upper topographic areas with ephemeral watercourses of gentle gradients. Both frogs occur predominantly in areas of higher precipitation and milder temperature regimes compared to averages representative of the region. Leaf litter is an important feature of P. australis breeding sites, whereas H australiacus generally associate with crayfish burrows. Both species are dependent on natural vegetation with a complex structure. H australiacus have a relatively long larval period (3 - 12 months) and breed in ephemeral pools, exposing their tadpoles to the risk of dying due to early pond drying. In the laboratory, tadpoles responded to decreasing water levels by shortening their larval periods and metamorphosing earlier than siblings held at constant water level. Despite this plastic response, a number of pools in the field failed to produce metamorphs due to early drying, an observation also made on P. australis. Regular monitoring of breeding sites revealed increased reproductive success away from roads for both species probably because of relatively longer hydroperiods. Spatial distributions and associations with habitat features, and movement patterns of both frogs were further investigated using mark-recapture methods. Both species showed strong site fidelity. P. australis formed small aggregations and predominantly selected leaf litter piles despite their relatively low availability. Leaf litter piles in creeks moved over time and the animals moved with these piles. In contrast, H australiacus individuals formed no aggregations and showed no preference for any available structural vegetation type. Locations of individuals were independent of relative distances to creeks and artificial drains, but males appeared to be more common near culverts. However, individuals were randomly distributed in space and nearest-neighbour distances were high relative to individual movement distances, suggesting minimal overlap between relatively large home ranges. Radio-telemetry demonstrated that some H australiacus individuals burrow in the road environment. There they would be at risk of being dug up and possibly injured during road works. The results are discussed in relation to the spatial requirements of both species and the protection of utilised habitat features. Management options are suggested to mitigate the impacts of road works. Differences in spatial dynamics of both frogs with overlapping habitats highlighted in this study require species-specific management approaches.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Toads.</field><field name="subject">Heleioporus Australiacus.</field><field name="subject">Pseudophryne Australis.</field><field name="subject">Endangered species.</field><field name="subject">Frogs.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/890</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies in the biology and reproductive characteristics of Pseudomugil signifer.</field><field name="creator">Howe, Effie Helena Irene</field><field name="description">The aims of this study were firstly to observe the breeding behaviour and embryo ology. and then to identify factors affecting the reproductive biology of the Australian native pseudomtlgilid Pseudomugil signifer (pacific blue-eye) and the impact upon it of the presence of the exotic species Gambusia holbrooki (eastern gambusia). Six species of the genus Pseudomugil, and the related Scaturiginichthys venneilipinnis, are found on the Australian continent. The normal breeding behaviour, egg surface morphology and embryology of four species of Pseudomugil (P. signijer, P. genrudae, P. tenellus and P. mellis) were first investigated, using aquarium and microscopic (light and S.E.M.) studies. The four species were divided into two groups: P. signifer and P. mellis; and P. tenellus and P. gertrudae. The study provided further evidence for the view that the embryology of the genus Pseudomugil differs markedly from that of members of the family Melanotaeniidae, with which the pseudomugilids have previously been grouped. The seasonal pattern of gonadal function in P. signifer, both in the field and in aquariums, was then investigated for populations of P. signifer from the Sydney region. It was found that P. signifer bred over the spring and summer months, commencing breeding as the temperature and daylength increased, and declining in breeding activity as daylength and temperature declined. There was no substantial difference in the pattern of reproductive activity between wild and captive stocks of P. signifer in the populations used. The impact of the presence of the introduced G. holbrooki on P. signifer was then examined, first in open-air tank experiments , and then in the field. In the tank experiments the exotic species profoundly affected the breeding of the native species. When G. holbrooki were in the tanks P. signifer did not gain weight or grow in total length (except for females given supplementary feed); ovarian weight and fecundity was greatly reduced and the ovaries were morphologically undeveloped. No eggs from P. signifer were observed in tanks which also housed G. holbrooki. G. holbrooki were observed to actively hunt and eat young P. signifer and to nip the caudal fins of adult P. signifer. The results indicate clearly, that at least in a captive situation, the presence of the exotic species has a very deleterious effect on breeding and hence possible survival, of a native population. A pilot study conducted at the same time as the harvest of the second tank study did not reveal such drastic consequences. However, even in the less confined field situation, some evidence of an interrelation between water quality, numbers of P. signifer and numbers of G. holbrooki were seen in one disturbed site (Home bush Bay). These findings suggest that a newly designed field experiment based on data collected from the power analysis of the pilot study could clarify whether G. holbrooki adversely affects P. signifer in the wild. The information gained from these studies can be used in the management of P. signifer in the wild, and serve as a model of the possible effects upon other native species.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pacific blue-eye.</field><field name="subject">Eastern gambusia.</field><field name="subject">Freshwater fishes.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/955</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Probiotic bacteria for hatchery production of Greenshell mussels, Perna canaliculus</field><field name="creator">Kesarcodi-Watson, Aditya</field><field name="description">The Greenshell&#8482; mussel (GSM), Perna canaliculus, industry in New Zealand (NZ) is the largest aquaculture sector in the country. In 2006, the export earnings were valued at US$145 million which represented 65% of NZ aquaculture earnings. Historically, and at present, GSM production involves the capture of wild mussels on ropes followed by on-growing of these animals to market size (approximately 14 months). However, hatchery production of GSM has been developed in recent years. Hatchery production will alleviate the seasonal uncertainties of current techniques and allow the benefits of selective breeding programs. To date, efforts to produce commercial quantities of GSM in hatcheries have been hampered by unreliable larval rearing. These problems were often alleviated by antibiotic use, which implied bacterial pathogens as the cause. Yet, the ongoing use of antibiotics is not sustainable because of increasing legislative restrictions on their use and the possible emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Hence, the identification and use of novel probiotics was investigated as an alternative. Because of a lack of previous work, it was necessary to investigate the bacterial pathogenesis of GSM larvae in the initial stages and, hence, to determine the cause of disease against which the probiotics would be active. Twenty-two bacterial strains, isolated from compromised larvae, were screened for larval toxicity using a larval bioassay. Two strains were identified as potential pathogens. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene identified Vibrio splendidus and Vibrio sp. DO1, a Vibrio coralliilyticus/neptunius-like isolate, as pathogens of GSM larvae. These strains had the- ability to cause 83 and 75% GSM larval mortality in vitro respectively, at a concentration 102 CFU ml-1. Histopathology indicated the route of infection was via the digestive system. Using healthy larvae as target hosts, Koch's postulates were confirmed for the two isolates. Although two bacterial pathogens were identified, the successful design and implementation of protective measures in the hatchery still required an understanding of the dynamics of the infection process. Developing an in situ experimental model for infection was therefore paramount. The minimum effective pathogenic dose (MEPD) of V. splendidus (105 CFU ml-1) and Vibrio sp. DO1 (106 CFU ml-1) was demonstrated for GSM larvae during hatchery production. In a flow-through water hatchery system, larvae given 1-2 hours of static water exposure with these pathogen doses, after which flowthrough processes resumed, averaged 58% and 69% cumulative mortality, respectively, on the fourth day following pathogen exposure. Larvae exposed to a dosage one order of magnitude greater than the MEPD, had higher mortalities of 73% and 96% for V. splendidus and Vibrio sp. DO1 respectively. These four levels of mortality were significantly greater than those of the non-exposed control larvae, averaging 23% in the experiments involving V. splendidus and 35% with Vibrio sp. DO1. Experiments were repeated four times to establish reproducibility. The infection models were reproducible and provided a tool to assess measures for the protection of GSM larvae against infection in the hatchery environment. A bioassay was developed to screen and select bacterial strains as potential probiotics for GSM larvae. Sixty-nine isolates originating from a GSM hatchery environment were tested for probiotic activity in larval pathogen-challenge bioassays conducted in tissue culture dishes (TCDs). Vibrio sp. DO1 and V. splendidus were the tested pathogens. Forty of the tested isolates afforded larval survival significantly greater than pathogen controls (p &lt; 0.05). The bioassay technique achieved a 58% success rate in searching for putative probiotics and highlighted the benefit of including the host animal in the first stage of the screening procedure. The time of inoculation of putative probiotic strains prior to pathogen challenge influenced the outcome of the assay. A pre-exposure period of 20 hours revealed a greater number of potential probiotics than a two-hour pre-exposure period. Pilot challenge tests, under normal hatchery conditions, confirmed the usefulness of the TCD screening method in recognising effective probiotics. Following hatchery pilot trials, two probiotic strains were chosen for further study, namely strains 0444 and 0536. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and phylogenetic analysis identified the strains as Alteromonas macleodii 0444 and Neptunomonas sp. 0536. Both probiotics were evaluated separately in a GSM hatchery facility during routine larval rearing and when the larvae were challenged with a high and low pathogenic dose of Vibrio sp. DO1 and V. splendidus. In all experiments, probiotic application significantly improved larval survival, if administered prior to pathogen exposure. Across all experiments, larvae that were exposed to the high and low dosages of pathogens averaged 14% and 36% survival respectively on the fourth day following pathogen exposure. If the probiotics were administered prior to pathogen challenge, larval survival averaged 50% and 66% respectively. Non-inoculated control larvae and larvae administered the probiotic alone demonstrated 67% and 79% survival respectively. In a repeat experiment, these benefits were reproduced, with the exception of A. macleodii 0444 trialled against V. splendidus. Neptunomonas sp. 0536 appeared to suppress naturally occurring vibrios in the culture environment of healthy GSM larvae. This was the first time A. macleodii and Neptunomonas sp. were demonstrated as probiotic bacteria. Many studies document probiotic application in aquaculture under conditions of pathogen attack, yet few describe the use of probiotics during routine production. The effects of administering the probiotic, A. macleodii 0444, during routine GSM larvae production, were compared against larvae from the same cohort that were not treated with the probiotic. The probiotic was administered daily for the first 11 days of the larval period and was provided at two concentrations, 107 CFU ml-1 and 108 CFU ml-1. Measures of larval swimming activity, gut colouration, lipid levels, larval survival, larval size and settlement success were recorded. There were minimal differences in all parameters between larvae provided the probiotic and control larvae. Probiotic treated larvae consumed more food and had higher lipid levels at the end of the larval period, but these were not statistically significant. All treatments completed the larval phase and settled successfully after metamorphosis. Survival at the end of the larval period was 37.2%, 38.8%, and 34.8% for control, 107 CFU ml-1 and 108 CFU ml-1 treatments respectively. The probiotic was still detected in larvae seven days after the final addition to the tanks. Animals were further grown in the field at a commercial farm. The probiotic was not detected in mussels at four months after leaving the hatchery. Combination use of the two probiotics, A. macleodii 0444 and Neptunomonas sp. 0536, was investigated to determine whether additive protection against pathogen attack with Vibrio sp. DO1 and V. splendidus was afforded to GSM larvae. The effects of combination administration were compared with larvae administered each probiotic as single strains and non-inoculated larvae. Additionally, two concentrations were tested for each probiotic, both singly and in combination, 107 and 108 CFU ml-1. Larvae were administered probiotics daily for the first six days, challenged with pathogens on the third day and then reared until settlement (day 19). Although protection against pathogen attack was observed in combination treatments, when compared with single-strain administration, additive protection was not apparent. Administration of 108 CFU ml-1 levels of probiotics, both singly and in combination, afforded larval survival slightly better than 107 CFU ml-1 levels, although this was rarely statistically significant. On the other hand, the higher levels of probiotic led to smaller larvae and lower feed rates for the majority of the 19-day trial. At the end of the study, larval sizes were smaller in the treatment applied a combination of probiotics at 108 CFU ml-1 than those of the other treatments. Additionally, towards the end of the larval period, feed consumption in the combination 108 CFU ml-1 treatment was similar to that witnessed in the other probiotic treatments one day previously. This suggested that either the larvae were compromised or they were growing slower. Despite a lack of additive protection against a single strain pathogen attack being demonstrated, the potential benefit of multi-strain probiotics, as prophylactic measures against every-day microbial encounters in larviculture, would remain. Although 108 CFU ml-1 levels appeared to protect against pathogen attack slightly better, they were also potentially detrimental to normal larval rearing when administered in combination. Following the successful completion of the larval period and pathogen protection afforded with a combination of probiotics at 107 CFU ml-1, this level was recommended as the best concentration of each probiotic where combination administration would be applied. The work presented in this thesis supports the use of A. macleodii 0444 and Neptunomonas sp. 0536 in the routine rearing of GSM larvae. The ability to produce settled juvenile mussels, equal in numbers to those produced in normal healthy conditions, plus the benefits against pathogen attack led to the recommendation of their use on a routine prophylactic basis in GSM larval rearing. Their use for this purpose is intended in the near future. A provisional patent has been prepared and will be submitted shortly. It is anticipated that future work will continue with these probiotic strains to determine their potential benefit for other aquaculture species.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Greenshell mussels.</field><field name="subject">Probiotics.</field><field name="subject">Aquaculture.</field><field name="subject">New Zealand.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1036</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A knowledge-based strategic theory framework for knowledge management : knowledge creation and transfer in businesses.</field><field name="creator">Duncan, Glen William</field><field name="description">University of Technology, Sydney.

However with increasing human pressures, many estuaries along the coastline of Australia have become degraded. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the effects of estuarine metal contaminants on the physiology, and the subsequent accumulation, in the smooth toadfish, Tetractenos glaber, and their prey items in estuaries in the Sydney region, south eastern Australia. Toadfish and sediments were collected during three seasonal sampling periods (June 2002, September 2002 and January 2003) in four estuaries in the Sydney region (Port Hacking River, Cowan Creek, Parramatta River and Lake Macquarie). Sediment and toadfish tissue metal concentrations varied both spatially and temporally, with highest concentrations exhibited in the metal contaminated estuaries (Lake Macquarie and Parramatta River) during spring 2002 and summer 2003. Toadfish accumulated metals in different tissue, however field experiments were limited in determining the main pathways of accumulation. Controlled laboratory kinetic experiments using radioisotopes of 109Cd and 75Se, indicated that differences in the relative contributions of water and food in the accumulation of these metals are generally governed by the physiology of the toadfish and the type of prey eaten. The distribution of metals in fish organs is important for better understanding metal kinetics and their subsequent toxicity. Toadfish exposed to 109Cd in both water or food showed a shift in distribution from gut lining at the end of the uptake phase to the excretory organs, such as liver, by the end of the loss phase, suggesting that the main uptake pathway for water exposure was via the gut and not the gills, due to fish drinking large amounts of water to maintain osmoregulation. There was no appreciable shift in the distribution of 75Se from the uptake or loss phases, being mostly associated with the excretory organs (gills, liver and kidneys). Further investigation into the accumulation of metals in toadfish prey items revealed that differences in uptake and loss of 109Cd and 75Se were influenced by their aqueous speciation, as well as differences in animal physiology, sequestration, storage and excitation mechanisms. The uptake rates and CFs of 109Cd and 75Se were highest, and the biological half-lives the longest, in pygmy mussels, ghost shrimps and polychaetes relative to the semaphore and soldier crabs. Elevated metal concentrations in certain toadfish tissues from the four estuaries were linked to reduced lipid concentrations and increased protein concentrations, which may be detrimental for growth, reproductive output and survivorship of the fish. A closer investigation into the nutritional value and metal concentrations of toadfish prey items in a selected metal contaminated estuary (Parramatta River) revealed that toadfish from the more contaminated sites within the estuary may grow faster due to higher nutritional value of prey items on a local scale, however on a larger spatial scale, this was not evident. Further investigation is required to determine whether larger toadfish size can be attributed to physiological acclimation or genetic resistance through generations of continuous metal exposure. Many studies have assessed metal concentrations in water, sediments and biota in the field, however few studies have combined both field and laboratory experiments to examine the effects of metals on fish physiology and reproduction, and metal transfer pathways in aquatic biota. This study has contributed to a better understanding of metal accumulation and its physiological effects in estuarine biota and highlights the high spatial and temporal variability in responses of organisms to environmental metal pollution.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heavy metals.</field><field name="subject">Estuarine biology.</field><field name="subject">Toadfishes.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1103</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Portfolio credit risk modelling and CDO pricing - analytics and implied trees from CDO tranches</field><field name="creator">Peng, Tao</field><field name="description">One of the most successful and most controversial innovative financial products in recent years has been collateralised debt obligations (CDOs). The dimensionality of dependency embedded in a typical CDO structure poses great challenges for researchers - in both generating realistic default dynamics and correlation, and in the mean time achieving fast and accurate model calibration. The research presented in this thesis contributes to the class of bottom-up models, which, as opposed to top-down models, start by modelling the individual obligor default process and then moving them up through the dependency structures to build up the loss distributions at the portfolio level. The Gaussian model (Li 2000) is a static copula model. It has only on correlation parameter, which can be calibrated to one CDO tranche at a time. Its simplicity achieves wide spread industry application even though it suffers from the problem of &#8217;correlation smile&#8217;. In other words, it cannot fit the market in an arbitrage-free manner in the capital-structure dimension. The first contribution of this thesis is the sensitivities analysis with regard to model parameters of expected losses of CDO tranches in the Gaussian and NIG copula models. The study provided substantial insight into the essence of the dependency structure. In addition, we apply the intensity approach to credit modelling in order to imply market distributions non-parametrically in the form of a binomial lattice. Under the same framework, we developed a series of three models. The static binomial model can be calibrated to the CDS index tranches exactly, with one set of parameters. The model can be seen as a non-parametric copula model that is arbitrage free in the capital-structure dimension. Static models are not suitable to price portfolio credit derivatives that are dynamic in nature. The static model can be naturally developed into a dynamic binomial model and satisfies no-arbitrage conditions in the time dimension. This setup, however, reduces model flexibility and calibration speed. The computational complexity comes from the non-Markovian character of the default process in the dynamic model. Inspired by Mortensen (2006), in which the author defines the intensity integral as a conditioning variable, we modify the dynamic model into a Markovian model by modelling the intensity integral directly, which greatly reduces the computational time and increases model fit in calibration. We also show that, when stochastic recovery rates are involved, there is a third no-arbitrage condition for the expected loss process that needs to be built into the Markovian model. For all binomial models, we adopt a unique optimisation algorithm for model calibration - the Cross Entropy method. It is particularly advantageous in solving large-scale non-linear optimsation problems with multiple local extrema, as encountered in our model.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Collateralised debt obligations.</field><field name="subject">Binomial coefficients.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1104</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Network controlled vertical handover for heterogeneous networks</field><field name="creator">Gami, Prashant Prabhulal</field><field name="description">Future wireless networks are expected to be a convergence of different wireless networks based on single Radio Access Technology. The aim is to provide seamless services to users any time from anywhere in the world using proper devices. In order to achieve this goal, seamless transition from one network to another with acceptable quality of service is required. Handover from one network to another is known as inter network or vertical handover. Currently known Mobile Controlled Vertical Handover schemes have some limitations. Mobile Station is limited with power and has very limited information about networks. Due to these limitations, Mobile Controlled Vertical Handover (MCVHO) can not achieve high performance in terms of hand over delay and handover decision. In this thesis, a new Network Controlled Vertical Handover (NCVHO) scheme is proposed. Proposed NCVHO scheme uses information which is available only to network along with information available to mobile node to enhance handover decision and reduce total number of handover and call dropping. NCVHO scheme also reduces the signaling on the wireless part of the network which reduces the usage of air interface. The scheme allows Point of Attachment (PoA) to make handover decision on behalf of mobile node which reduces signaling on the wireless part of the network. This change in a vertical handover scheme reduces signaling delay of the handover and achieves better handover delay performance. NCVHO scheme is reduces signaling on the air interface and uses more information to make handover decision which can achieve higher performance for number of handovers and call dropping than MCVHO. The price is paid as increased processing delay at the Point of Attachment (poA). Simulation in this thesis shows that NCVHO performance decreases at higher number of users in comparison with MCVHO. A solution to this problem is also proposed in this thesis with some modification to NCVHO scheme, a new network controlled vertical handover scheme called distributed Network Controlled Vertical Handover (distNCVHO) is proposed. The scheme achieves better performance than NCVHO scheme in terms of handover delay, number of handovers and call dropping. It is noticed in this thesis that more information available from the network can enhance handover decision which can in turn reduce total number of handovers with a large margin. Information such as network load, network properties such as coverage, available bandwidth can play a vital role in the handover decision making. Reduced usage of air interface can allow network to perform handover faster and reduce number of total handover attempts.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1105</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Moving to the coast : internal migration and place contestation in Northern New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Kijas, Johanna</field><field name="description">University of Technology, Sydney.

A.</field><field name="description">This dissertation explores the influences on individual decision making in a complex, real world context &#8211; the New Zealand wool supply chain. It asks two fundamental questions, first, how do decision makers make decisions in their everyday settings and, second, how is decision making learned and improved through experience and contextual factors. Two contextual aspects of decision making were also examined; these included whether decision making processes varied as a result of uncertainty and risky surroundings, or in cooperative and competitive environments. Further examination included revealing how being a member of a (multi-layered) group influences individual decision making. In-depth qualitative interviewing of sheep farmers, and associated supply chain members in the wool industry was undertaken. Three key decision journeys were explored from both the 'psychological' and the 'social' schools of social psychology in order to give detail on the flow of decision making influences through human systems (whether entities were present, or implied). One of the main aspects of this study was to employ, by analogy, an analysis inspired by the concept of multi-level selection from evolutionary theory as a means of understanding decision making in such a complex, layered system. Other contributions include commentary on the nature of social psychological studies of decision making, suggestions for the expansion of naturalistic decision making to include processes occurring on more than one 'level' of context, the framing of information in the media and the judgment of information sources on the part of experienced and inexperienced farmers, and, the role that globalization may play in driving decision making behaviour.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">wool supply chain</field><field name="subject">naturalistic decision making</field><field name="subject">uncertainty</field><field name="subject">rational-analytical approaches</field><field name="subject">intuition</field><field name="subject">social psychology</field><field name="subject">multi-level selection</field><field name="subject">agribusiness chains</field><field name="subject">170113 - Social and Community Psychology</field><field name="subject">070106 - Farm Management, Rural Management and Agribusiness</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/2156</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An advancement in analytical modelling of soil-infilled rock joints and their practical applications</field><field name="creator">Oliveira, David Americo Fortuna</field><field name="description">An infilled rock joint is likely to be the weakest plane in a rock mass. The most pronounced effect of the presence of infill material is the reduction in friction of the discontinuity boundaries (i.e. rock to rock contact of the joint walls). The thicker the infill, the smaller the shear strength of the rock joint. Once the infill reaches a critical thickness, the joint walls (rock) play no significant role in the overall shear strength. Several models have been proposed to predict the peak shear strength of infilled joints under both constant normal load (CNL) and constant normal stiffness (CNS) boundary conditions, taking into account the ratio of infill thickness (t) to the height of the joint wall asperity (a), i.e. the t/a ratio. Models based on the CNS condition provide a much better accuracy of the infilled joint behaviour in the field, but only a limited number of studies have focused on the more realistic CNS stress-strain behaviour. This study presents a critical review of some of the earlier studies and the most recent advancement of a shear-strength model developed at University of Wollongong, Australia, supplemented with laboratory data for model validation. The effect of different factors on the shear behaviour such as the t/a ratio, infill friction angle, joint wall roughness, joint stiffness, and type of infill are presented. In addition the implication of soil-infilled joint on rock mass behaviour is investigated through extensive practical applications both analytical and numerical. The new set of proposed discontinuity strength and deformation relationships can be used as an alternative approach in design. Although the proposed soil-infilled joint model still suffers from inevitable limitations such as the empirical parameters that need further calibration with experimental data, the study vividly demonstrates its practical value with respect to underground excavation and slope stability in jointed rock mass.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3085</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecophysiology of salt- and waterlogging tolerance in selected species of Halosarcia</field><field name="creator">English, Jeremy Parker</field><field name="description">&lt;abstract&gt;</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chenopodiaceae -- Ecophysiology -- Western Australia -- Hannan Lake</field><field name="subject">Chenopodiaceae -- Effect of salt on -- Western Australia -- Hannan Lake</field><field name="subject">Chenopodiaceae -- Effect of water levels on -- Western Australia -- Hannan Lake</field><field name="subject">Halophytes -- Ecophysiology -- Western Australia -- Hannan Lake</field><field name="subject">Halophytes -- Effect of salt on -- Western Australia -- Hannan Lake</field><field name="subject">Halophytes -- Effect of water levels on -- Western Australia -- Hannan Lake</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0075</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adolescent onset anorexia nervosa : a model for the effects of inadequate nutrition upon bone size and development</field><field name="creator">Turner, Justine Marie</field><field name="description">Despite usual onset during adolescence the cause of low bone density in adolescent onset anorexia nervosa is incompletely understood. Puberty is known to be a crucial time for the development of peak bone mass, due principally to growth plate bone formation and modelling on preformed surfaces. This results in bone formation uncoupled from bone resorption leading to increased bone size due to increase in matrix and bone mineral content. It was hypothesized that low bone density in adolescent anorexia nervosa was caused by malnutrition during puberty suppressing normal bone matrix formation at all sites of bone formation thus arresting bone mineralization. Method 49 female adolescents with anorexia nervosa and 109 healthy female adolescent controls were studied. 22 of the anorexia nervosa subjects were studied again a year later. Bone area, mineral content and density were measured using Dual Xray Absorptiometry at the spine, hip and whole body sites, including body composition assessment. Estimated volumetric bone density was calculated using published equations in order to study bone density independent of bone size. Height, weight and Tanner stage in puberty were measured. Dietary intake and physical exercise were assessed using questionnaires. In a subset of anorexia nervosa and control subjects bone age was measured.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial and temporal dynamics of Australian rainforests</field><field name="creator">Melinda Laidlaw</field><field name="description">Abstract The loss of tropical and subtropical rainforest biodiversity due to increasing anthropogenic pressure lends urgency to understanding the processes which drive species coexistence. Without an understanding of how species are distributed across the landscape and how species assemblages change through time, we cannot derive appropriate management regimes for their persistence. This thesis examines the role of deterministic drivers of spatial and temporal dynamics of Australian rainforests and investigates the potential impacts of a changing climate on Australian rainforests. The findings from three studies are presented in four chapters which examine floristic turnover in situ and at catchment, regional and continental scales. Compositional turnover in tropical rainforest following the passage of a category three cyclone was examined both at five years&#8217; post-cyclone recovery and in the context of local and regional spatial turnover. After five years, the forest remained in an active state of recovery with an approximate 30% increase in stems, 5% decrease in basal area and a 16% increase in species richness. Local spatial turnover suggests differential impacts of cyclones over even short distances and overall, a high degree of temporal stability in these rainforests, despite the impact of frequent catastrophic disturbances. Compositional turnover in subtropical rainforest along steep moisture and temperature gradients was investigated and described along an altitudinal transect in subtropical rainforest. The identification of significant modelled climatic and mapped soil variables suggests that moisture stress is an important driver of floristic turnover in these forests. Existing high levels of turnover across tree assemblages from low to mid elevations in subtropical rainforest were identified. Such turnover is greatly reduced at higher elevations. With increasing atmospheric temperatures, the cloud cap is expected to rise and we predict that subtropical rainforest communities which currently sit at the level of the cloud base (800-900m) will experience increasing in situ floristic turnover. Our findings agree with predictions for cloud forests elsewhere: high elevation endemic species will face an increasing risk of extinction as mesic climatic envelopes move upslope out of reach. Baseline data from this study will be used as a benchmark against which to formulate and test hypotheses for climate induced floristic and structural shift. It is also acknowledged that monitoring floristic turnover as a surrogate of shifting climatic envelopes may be confounded both by a lack of knowledge regarding the underlying turnover rates of rainforest communities and by the disparity in temporal scales of tree community turnover and accelerating anthropogenic climate change. Finally, generalized dissimilarity modelling is utilised to combine disparate biological survey data and remotely sensed environmental data to investigate the determinants of floristic turnover at the regional scale. Generalized dissimilarity modelling identified four environmental predictors of &#946;-diversity in subtropical rainforest, all closely linked with moisture stress: radiation of the driest quarter, precipitation of the driest period, slope and aspect. Ten land classes were identified and mapped for the Mt Warning Caldera and may act as appropriate management units for future climate change planning within the region. This thesis has identified a potential threat to the biodiversity of Australian rainforests under a changing climate. Increasing levels of evapotranspiration, moisture stress and an increased return rate and intensity of disturbance are predicted to lead to the upslope movement of species ranges, increasing levels of in situ floristic turnover, and will likely result in the emergence of novel rainforest communities not present under current conditions. The potential for anthropogenic climate change to impact upon native vegetation communities has emphasised the need for the continuation and expansion of monitoring programs and the development of dynamic management regimes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">&#946;-diversity</field><field name="subject">climate change</field><field name="subject">cloud</field><field name="subject">climate</field><field name="subject">compositional turnover</field><field name="subject">determinism</field><field name="subject">distance</field><field name="subject">environmental surrogacy</field><field name="subject">soils</field><field name="subject">topography</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206170</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rhys Test Thesis</field><field name="creator">Mr Rhys Palmer</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:152830</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction.

Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted.

New generation active video games may provide an opportunity to convert traditional sedentary screen-time into active screen-time. The aims of this thesis were to: 1) determine the metabolic costs of different activities; 2) determine whether experience and fitness influence the metabolic costs of active video games; and 3) determine children's enjoyment of active video games. Accordingly, this thesis is presented as two papers. Twenty-six boys' (11.4 &#177; 0.8 yr) participated in the study. Each performed sedentary activities (resting, watching television and sedentary gaming), active video games (Nintendo&#174; Wii Bowling, Boxing, Tennis, Skiing and Step Aerobics), traditional physical activities (walking and running) and a maximal fitness test. During all activities oxygen uptake and heart rate were measured and energy expenditure (EE) calculated. The active video games resulted in a significantly higher EE compared to rest (63-190%, p&lt;0.05). No significant differences in EE were found between the most active video games (Wii Boxing and Wii Step) and walking. The intensities of the active video games were low (&#8804; 3 METSmeas). There was no evidence to suggest that gaming experience or aerobic fitness influenced EE during active video game play. Using the same sample, the aim was to determine the participants' enjoyment of active video games sedentary activities and physical activities. Participants' enjoyment was measured using the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale immediately after the activities. The percentages of children that enjoyed each activity were: walking (39%), television (58%), running (60%), PS3 (73%), Wii Boxing (88%), Wii Tennis (77%), Wii Fit (75%) and Wii Bowling (89%). The active video games were the most enjoyable activities irrespective of participants' weight status, fitness and experience. The metabolic costs of active video games suggest that they may be suitable for future interventions which are aimed at decreasing time spent in sedentary behaviour. However, as they are low intensity activities, active video game play time should not be accumulated as part of the 60-minutes of daily moderate to vigorous physical activity that is currently recommended for children.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">active video games</field><field name="subject">physical activity</field><field name="subject">sedentary behaviour</field><field name="subject">energy expenditure</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/934</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing change as a Minister of the Crown</field><field name="creator">Gair, George Frederick</field><field name="description">During my years as a Cabinet Minister in New Zealand, the relationship between a Minister and his key officials was strongly modelled on the Westminster system as then applied in Britain. As in Britain, the ministers were the product of the political and parliamentary processes. The leader of the political party with the majority in the House was called upon by the Queen's representative (our Governor General) to form the new Government. All Ministerial appointees were necessarily chosen entirely from members then in Parliament. As in Britain, also, the key officials to serve each Minister in their portfolios were provided by the career Public Service, the long-serving body of officials who were there to advise and manage the system for successive governments. The Minister did not choose his departmental head, nor did that departmental head choose his minister. There were many assumptions inherited from the past which helped to make the relationship work. Policy decisions were shaped by the Minister representing the political side of the equation. Execution and management was carried out by the head official, responsible for the operation of the bureaucratic machine he headed. In explaining my thesis message - "Managing Change as a Minister of the Crown" - a very strong autobiographical dimension to my experience and comments is inevitable. In the political setting, the relationship between Minister and Head of Department, though a key factor, is but one of many. All change affects many people - some positively and beneficially, and some the reverse. The effects of change can be anticipated rather than actually felt. Perceptions can sometimes become bigger problems to manage than realised consequences. Change in politics invariably reaches out far beyond those obviously and directly affected. Handling change therefore involves making plans for how one can best point the change in a forward-looking and constructive way, and put a socially positive spin on one's efforts and the outcome. If one's efforts are done openly, and one's arguments are well founded, real progress can be made. One of life's constants is change itself. It affects us all in some measure. In communities categorized as "developed", it can be particularly fast and sweeping. This means, inevitably, that the forms of its infrastructures - from public services to business enterprises - which enable society and the economy to function effectively must adapt, and constructively, to those changes. From my experience, in facing a variety of problems calling for change in handling portfolio responsibilities, I have found every case is different from the others, and each solution had to be shaped to meet the characteristics of that particular case. The only common denominator I would call the "people factor". Compounding the challenge, that "people factor" had to be fashioned as appropriate for the personalities with whom I was working, and the characteristics of the problem being addressed. I did, however, find that there were some common fundamentals in the "people factor" which I address in my conclusion. They helped facilitate co-operation in managing change.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Change management as a Minister</field><field name="subject">Autobiography</field><field name="subject">Autobiographical research method</field><field name="subject">Energy administration</field><field name="subject">Energy sector</field><field name="subject">Case studies</field><field name="subject">Government responsibilities</field><field name="subject">Paperwork before information technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/936</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pathways to principalship</field><field name="creator">Dalgleish, Alison</field><field name="description">A qualitative descriptive approach was undertaken to research what was available within the areas of advice and guidance for potential principals who wish to achieve the position of principal at secondary schools in Aotearoa New Zealand. The literature review for this study uncovered very little in the way of New Zealand-based professional advice and guidance for potential principals, despite there being some leadership development programmes such as the Principal Preparation Programmes for Aspiring Principals (University of Auckland, Centre for Educational Leadership). However, the international literature revealed a greater wealth of data on existing principal preparation programmes, and the phenomenon of leadership. In terms of the methodology, case studies and interviews of six participants were undertaken. Six current principals of provincial North Island secondary schools in New Zealand were interviewed face-to-face. Their stories were audio-taped and transcribed. The interviews were essentially rich narratives of leadership stories and were somewhat akin to individual case studies of the participants' own leadership and principal development. Content and thematic analysis of the data revealed eight aspects of principal development which were distilled to four main themes: historical career pathway; managing the journey; handing over the knowledge; and personal costs to the participants. The findings from this research showed that few principals followed planned career pathways or had access to advice, guidance or formal training for principalship. Participants generally gained principal positions through good luck rather than good management. The increasing complexity of the principal's role, combined with a projected shortage of competent candidates, requires that preparation for principalship needs to be implemented as a well-structured, rigorous programme. A framework for such a programme is proposed.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Principalship</field><field name="subject">Pathways</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/935</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Amino acid racemization geochronology - contributions to the understanding of Quaternary sea-level changes, neotectonics and coastal evolution.</field><field name="creator">Murray-Wallace, Colin Vincent</field><field name="description">Title page, table of contents and abstract only.

The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of milk protein ingredients on physico-chemical properties of rice starch : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology at Massey University Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Noisuwan, Angkana</field><field name="description">The overall aim of this thesis is to determine if the interactions between normal and waxy rice starch and milk proteins from four milk protein ingredients, namely skim milk powder (SMP), milk protein concentrate (MPC), sodium caseinate (NaCAS) and whey protein isolate (WPI) do occur, and to identify the mechanisms underlying these interactions. Different milk protein ingredients at various concentrations (0 to 10%, w/w) affected markedly and differently the pasting behaviour of 10% (w/w) rice starches. SMP delayed the pasting of both rice starches by increasing the onset temperature (Tonset) and the peak viscosity temperature (Tpeak) of pasting. This was mainly due to the presence of lactose and ions, which was further supported by the investigation of the effects of UFSMP (a solution of salts and lactose present in SMP at their proper concentration) and lactose. The addition of NaCAS also delayed the pasting of rice starch; Tpeak in the case of both starches was increased. For normal rice starch paste, MPC and WPI decreased the Tpeak. MPC had no affect on Tpeak of waxy rice starch paste. The qualitative viscoelastic behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient gels obtained from the above pastes was dominated by the continuous phase made of the starch molecules. There was evidence, as indicated by confocal microscopy, of phase separation between the milk proteins of SMP and MPC and the two starches. The phase separation was not observed in the addition of either NaCAS or WPI. Studies on the thermal behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient mixtures by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that SMP, similarly to UFSMP, delayed the gelatinization of both starches. NaCAS also delayed the gelatinisation of both starches but had a greater effect on waxy than normal rice starch. The addition of NaCAS did not affect Tonset but increased Tpeak for normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinisation temperature of waxy rice starch was highly affected by the addition of NaCAS with both Tonset and Tpeak shifted to higher temperatures. MPC had no affect on the gelatinization temperature of normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinization temperature of waxy rice starch was increased by the addition of MPC. The addition of WPI to both rice starches showed two thermal transitions. The first of these was due to the gelatinisation of the starches and the second to the denaturation of &#223;-lactoglobulin (&#223;-lg). The addition of WPI to normal rice starch showed that the thermal behaviour of normal starch and protein were independent from each other. In contrast, the thermal behaviour of waxy rice starch was modified by the addition of WPI; both Tonset and Tpeak were increased. SMP decreased the Tonset of swelling, swelling ratio and the amount of starch leaching from both starches. These observed changes were due to the presence of lactose and ions in SMP. NaCAS slightly increased Tonset of swelling but the amount of starch leaching was reduced for both rice starches. The rigidity of both starches tended to increase in the presence of NaCAS. MPC and WPI affected the swelling behaviour of normal and waxy rice starch differently. A dramatic increase in the swelling of normal rice starch/MPC or WPI mixtures was observed, whereas this trend was not evident for waxy rice starch/ MPC or WPI mixtures. The difference in the water holding ability and gelatinization peak temperatures of the two starches over the temperature range at which whey proteins denature and form gels are believed to be responsible for the observed differences. The results from confocal microscopy showed that milk proteins, such as a-casein, &#223;- casein, &#223;-lg and a-lactalbumin (a-la), were adsorbed onto the granule surface of both normal and waxy rice starch. The mechanism for this adsorption is the hydrophilic interactions; hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl group from terminated glucan molecule that protrude around starch granule surface-hydroxyl; amino, or other electron-donation or electron-accepting groups of the added proteins. Using sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) it was found that for SMP and MPC the adsorbed as- to &#223;-casein ratio on both starches was similar to the as-casein to &#223;- casein ratio in the casein micelle at low SMP and MPC concentrations. But at high concentrations of SMP or MPC, this ratio decreased indicating that more &#223;-casein was adsorbed preferentially to as-casein. In the case of NaCAS, as-casein was adsorbed preferentially to &#223;-casein. Moreover, there was evidence of multilayer adsorption of ascasein into the surface of rice starch granules. Compared to the other milk protein ingredients, very small amounts of the &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI were adsorbed onto starch granules. However, the adsorbed amounts of &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI continuously increased with increasing WPI concentration, suggesting that these two proteins, particularly &#223;-lg, adsorbed in multilayers too.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">waxy rice starch</field><field name="subject">lactoglobulin</field><field name="subject">gelatinazation</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290104 Other food sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/905</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who talks, what they talk about, and how much they say : a study of bulletin structure and source use in New Zealand free-to-air television news programmes : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management in Communication Management, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Macdonald, Julie Susan</field><field name="description">Free-to-air television news is an accessible and popular means through which audiences can gain knowledge and understanding about the world. Therefore, the nature of the news provided has important implications for the opportunities audiences have to become informed about events and issues, and to use this knowledge to participate in social decision-making. The structure and content of news bulletins reflect the decisions made by broadcasters about the topics that are considered to be important, and which sources should have the opportunity to be represented. Thus, the goal of this research was to compare the structure and content of the news provided by New Zealand&#8217;s national free-to-air news programmes; ONE News (TVNZ), 3 News (TV3), Prime News (Prime Television), and Te K ea (M ori Television). A content analysis of one constructed week of the four news programmes was undertaken, focusing on four general areas of interest. First, the profile of the news bulletins was examined (i.e., the proportion of the bulletin allocated to different segments of the news, the duration of main news stories, the origin of production of main news stories, the proportion of New Zealand and international news, and the topics included in the news). Second, the research investigated the identity of the types of sources selected by the broadcasters for inclusion in locally produced main news stories. Third, the frequency and duration of &#233;lite and non-&#233;lite source speech was examined. Finally, the extent to which journalists speak on camera in news stories was also investigated. The study showed that the four programmes generally conformed to the &#8216;standard profile&#8217; of modern television news bulletins; the programmes included considerable amounts of non-news content and the news topics often reflected entertainment values, rather than focusing on serious issues. A further significant characteristic of the bulletins was that &#233;lite sources were more likely to be included in news stories on all programmes and generally had greater opportunities to speak. However, in many respects it appears that Te K ea provides an alternative news bulletin compared to the other three channels, by focusing on a wider range of news topics, including more non-&#233;lite sources in stories, and giving all sources considerably more time to share their views. Te K ea seems to broadcast a news programme that makes a compromise between the entertainment values which are entrenched in contemporary television news, and the broader M ori Television mandate to inform and educate the public. This contrasts with the more homogenous (in terms of the characteristics examined in this research) news programmes offered by the ONE News, 3 News, and Prime News. This study concludes that the nationally available free-to-air news programmes currently broadcast on New Zealand television fulfil the traditional news functions of informing and educating the public in only a very narrow sense. The deregulated news environment is poised to undergo further transformation with an anticipated increase in convergence among news media and the emergence of more television news providers. The challenge within this commercial environment is for ONE News, 3 News, Prime News, and Te K ea to deliver on their stated commitments to provide information and promote debate on the important issues of the day.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">news bulletins</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">public broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/922</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rheo-NMR studies of macromolecules : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Physics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kakubayashi, Motoko</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the effects of simple shear flow on macromolecular structure and interactions are investigated in detail via a combination of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and rheology, namely Rheo-NMR. A specially designed NMR couette shear cell and benchtop shear cell, developed in-house, demonstrated that the direct measurement of the above phenomena is possible. First, to determine whether the shear cells were creating simple shear flow, results were reproduced from literature studies of liquid crystal systems which report shear effects on: Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) in deuterium oxide, and Poly(gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PBLG) in m-cresol. Next, the possible conformational changes to protein structure brought about by shear were investigated by applying shear to Bovine  -lactogobulin ( -Lg). As the protein was sheared, a small, irreversible conformational change was observed by means of one-dimensional and two-dimensional 1H NMR with reasonable reproducibility. However, no observable change was detected by means of light scattering. A large conformational change was observed after shearing a destabilized  -Lg sample containing 10% Trifluoroethanol (TFE) (v/v). From an NMR point of view, the sheared state was similar to the structure of  -Lg containing large amounts of  -helices and, interestingly, similar to the structure of  -Lg containing  -sheet amyloid fibrils. Gel electrophoresis tests suggested that the changes were caused by hydrophobic interactions. Unfortunately, this proved to be difficult to reproduce. The effect of shear on an inter-macromolecular interaction was investigated by applying shear during an enzyme reaction of pectin methylesterase (PME) on pectin. Experimental method and analysis developments are described in detail. It was observed that under the conditions studied, shear does not interfere with the de-esterification of pectin with two types of PME, which have different action mechanisms at average shear rates up to 1570 s-1.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">macromolecular structure</field><field name="subject">shear</field><field name="subject">pectin</field><field name="subject">protein interactions</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240300 Atomic and Molecular Physics; Nuclear and Particle Physics, Plasma Physics::240301 Atomic and molecular physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/976</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reflecting diversity or selecting viewpoints : an analysis of the GM debate in New Zealand's media 1998-2002 : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of PhD in Communication at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ashwell, Douglas James</field><field name="description">The advent of genetically modified (GM) food in New Zealand in 1998 saw the beginning of a highly politicised debate about GM use in the country. The concern over GM and the political situation after the 1999 general election saw the Government establish a Royal Commission of Inquiry on Genetic Modification in May, 2000. The Royal Commission and strong public opposition to GM, evident in large public protests and other actions, made the issue highly newsworthy. The aim of this study was to explore how newspapers reported the GM debate, in particular, examining whether the reportage facilitated greater public debate and awareness about GM through journalists adhering to the ideals of the theory of social responsibility and enacting their watchdog role as encapsulated in the Fourth Estate tradition of the media. To achieve these aims the overall tone of the reportage and also which news source types and themes were most frequently reported were examined. In addition, the relationship and perceptions of scientists and journalists involved in the reporting were explored to examine how these relationships may have influenced the reportage. Content analysis showed the reportage had a pro-GM bias with policy-makers, scientists and industry spokespeople the most frequently cited news sources. The themes of Science, Economics and Politics dominated the reportage. Other source types and themes were less represented, especially themes dealing with ethical and environmental arguments. This lack of representation occurred despite the Royal Commission offering a space for all interested parties to speak. The interviews illustrated that scientists believed the quality of newspaper coverage of GM lacked depth and that important issues were unreported. Journalists found the issue complex to report and said they took care not to oversimplify the science and issues surrounding GM. The relationship between scientists and journalists indicated particular tensions existing between the two groups. The thesis concludes that if robust public debate is to occur within New Zealand regarding GM and other scientific developments, then the media should reflect a greater diversity of opinion by citing other potential news sources offering alternative arguments based on, for example, ethical or environmental grounds.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">journalism viewpoints</field><field name="subject">newspaper report evaluation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::289900 Other Information, Computing and Communication Sciences ::289999 Other information, computing and communication sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1200</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An embarrassment of riches : rekindling desire for obsolete furniture : a exegesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Design, Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Neale, Wendy</field><field name="description">This exegesis tells the story of my Master of Design project, Embarrassment of Riches.

Six species of the genus Pseudomugil, and the related Scaturiginichthys venneilipinnis, are found on the Australian continent. The normal breeding behaviour, egg surface morphology and embryology of four species of Pseudomugil (P. signijer, P. genrudae, P. tenellus and P. mellis) were first investigated, using aquarium and microscopic (light and S.E.M.) studies. The four species were divided into two groups: P. signifer and P. mellis; and P. tenellus and P. gertrudae. The study provided further evidence for the view that the embryology of the genus Pseudomugil differs markedly from that of members of the family Melanotaeniidae, with which the pseudomugilids have previously been grouped. The seasonal pattern of gonadal function in P. signifer, both in the field and in aquariums, was then investigated for populations of P. signifer from the Sydney region. It was found that P. signifer bred over the spring and summer months, commencing breeding as the temperature and daylength increased, and declining in breeding activity as daylength and temperature declined. There was no substantial difference in the pattern of reproductive activity between wild and captive stocks of P. signifer in the populations used. The impact of the presence of the introduced G. holbrooki on P. signifer was then examined, first in open-air tank experiments , and then in the field. In the tank experiments the exotic species profoundly affected the breeding of the native species. When G. holbrooki were in the tanks P. signifer did not gain weight or grow in total length (except for females given supplementary feed); ovarian weight and fecundity was greatly reduced and the ovaries were morphologically undeveloped. No eggs from P. signifer were observed in tanks which also housed G. holbrooki. G. holbrooki were observed to actively hunt and eat young P. signifer and to nip the caudal fins of adult P. signifer. The results indicate clearly, that at least in a captive situation, the presence of the exotic species has a very deleterious effect on breeding and hence possible survival, of a native population. A pilot study conducted at the same time as the harvest of the second tank study did not reveal such drastic consequences. However, even in the less confined field situation, some evidence of an interrelation between water quality, numbers of P. signifer and numbers of G. holbrooki were seen in one disturbed site (Home bush Bay). These findings suggest that a newly designed field experiment based on data collected from the power analysis of the pilot study could clarify whether G. holbrooki adversely affects P. signifer in the wild. The information gained from these studies can be used in the management of P. signifer in the wild, and serve as a model of the possible effects upon other native species.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pacific blue-eye.</field><field name="subject">Eastern gambusia.</field><field name="subject">Freshwater fishes.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/955</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Probiotic bacteria for hatchery production of Greenshell mussels, Perna canaliculus</field><field name="creator">Kesarcodi-Watson, Aditya</field><field name="description">The Greenshell&#8482; mussel (GSM), Perna canaliculus, industry in New Zealand (NZ) is the largest aquaculture sector in the country. In 2006, the export earnings were valued at US$145 million which represented 65% of NZ aquaculture earnings. Historically, and at present, GSM production involves the capture of wild mussels on ropes followed by on-growing of these animals to market size (approximately 14 months). However, hatchery production of GSM has been developed in recent years. Hatchery production will alleviate the seasonal uncertainties of current techniques and allow the benefits of selective breeding programs. To date, efforts to produce commercial quantities of GSM in hatcheries have been hampered by unreliable larval rearing. These problems were often alleviated by antibiotic use, which implied bacterial pathogens as the cause. Yet, the ongoing use of antibiotics is not sustainable because of increasing legislative restrictions on their use and the possible emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Hence, the identification and use of novel probiotics was investigated as an alternative. Because of a lack of previous work, it was necessary to investigate the bacterial pathogenesis of GSM larvae in the initial stages and, hence, to determine the cause of disease against which the probiotics would be active. Twenty-two bacterial strains, isolated from compromised larvae, were screened for larval toxicity using a larval bioassay. Two strains were identified as potential pathogens. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene identified Vibrio splendidus and Vibrio sp. DO1, a Vibrio coralliilyticus/neptunius-like isolate, as pathogens of GSM larvae. These strains had the- ability to cause 83 and 75% GSM larval mortality in vitro respectively, at a concentration 102 CFU ml-1. Histopathology indicated the route of infection was via the digestive system. Using healthy larvae as target hosts, Koch's postulates were confirmed for the two isolates. Although two bacterial pathogens were identified, the successful design and implementation of protective measures in the hatchery still required an understanding of the dynamics of the infection process. Developing an in situ experimental model for infection was therefore paramount. The minimum effective pathogenic dose (MEPD) of V. splendidus (105 CFU ml-1) and Vibrio sp. DO1 (106 CFU ml-1) was demonstrated for GSM larvae during hatchery production. In a flow-through water hatchery system, larvae given 1-2 hours of static water exposure with these pathogen doses, after which flowthrough processes resumed, averaged 58% and 69% cumulative mortality, respectively, on the fourth day following pathogen exposure. Larvae exposed to a dosage one order of magnitude greater than the MEPD, had higher mortalities of 73% and 96% for V. splendidus and Vibrio sp. DO1 respectively. These four levels of mortality were significantly greater than those of the non-exposed control larvae, averaging 23% in the experiments involving V. splendidus and 35% with Vibrio sp. DO1. Experiments were repeated four times to establish reproducibility. The infection models were reproducible and provided a tool to assess measures for the protection of GSM larvae against infection in the hatchery environment. A bioassay was developed to screen and select bacterial strains as potential probiotics for GSM larvae. Sixty-nine isolates originating from a GSM hatchery environment were tested for probiotic activity in larval pathogen-challenge bioassays conducted in tissue culture dishes (TCDs). Vibrio sp. DO1 and V. splendidus were the tested pathogens. Forty of the tested isolates afforded larval survival significantly greater than pathogen controls (p &lt; 0.05). The bioassay technique achieved a 58% success rate in searching for putative probiotics and highlighted the benefit of including the host animal in the first stage of the screening procedure. The time of inoculation of putative probiotic strains prior to pathogen challenge influenced the outcome of the assay. A pre-exposure period of 20 hours revealed a greater number of potential probiotics than a two-hour pre-exposure period. Pilot challenge tests, under normal hatchery conditions, confirmed the usefulness of the TCD screening method in recognising effective probiotics. Following hatchery pilot trials, two probiotic strains were chosen for further study, namely strains 0444 and 0536. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and phylogenetic analysis identified the strains as Alteromonas macleodii 0444 and Neptunomonas sp. 0536. Both probiotics were evaluated separately in a GSM hatchery facility during routine larval rearing and when the larvae were challenged with a high and low pathogenic dose of Vibrio sp. DO1 and V. splendidus. In all experiments, probiotic application significantly improved larval survival, if administered prior to pathogen exposure. Across all experiments, larvae that were exposed to the high and low dosages of pathogens averaged 14% and 36% survival respectively on the fourth day following pathogen exposure. If the probiotics were administered prior to pathogen challenge, larval survival averaged 50% and 66% respectively. Non-inoculated control larvae and larvae administered the probiotic alone demonstrated 67% and 79% survival respectively. In a repeat experiment, these benefits were reproduced, with the exception of A. macleodii 0444 trialled against V. splendidus. Neptunomonas sp. 0536 appeared to suppress naturally occurring vibrios in the culture environment of healthy GSM larvae. This was the first time A. macleodii and Neptunomonas sp. were demonstrated as probiotic bacteria. Many studies document probiotic application in aquaculture under conditions of pathogen attack, yet few describe the use of probiotics during routine production. The effects of administering the probiotic, A. macleodii 0444, during routine GSM larvae production, were compared against larvae from the same cohort that were not treated with the probiotic. The probiotic was administered daily for the first 11 days of the larval period and was provided at two concentrations, 107 CFU ml-1 and 108 CFU ml-1. Measures of larval swimming activity, gut colouration, lipid levels, larval survival, larval size and settlement success were recorded. There were minimal differences in all parameters between larvae provided the probiotic and control larvae. Probiotic treated larvae consumed more food and had higher lipid levels at the end of the larval period, but these were not statistically significant. All treatments completed the larval phase and settled successfully after metamorphosis. Survival at the end of the larval period was 37.2%, 38.8%, and 34.8% for control, 107 CFU ml-1 and 108 CFU ml-1 treatments respectively. The probiotic was still detected in larvae seven days after the final addition to the tanks. Animals were further grown in the field at a commercial farm. The probiotic was not detected in mussels at four months after leaving the hatchery. Combination use of the two probiotics, A. macleodii 0444 and Neptunomonas sp. 0536, was investigated to determine whether additive protection against pathogen attack with Vibrio sp. DO1 and V. splendidus was afforded to GSM larvae. The effects of combination administration were compared with larvae administered each probiotic as single strains and non-inoculated larvae. Additionally, two concentrations were tested for each probiotic, both singly and in combination, 107 and 108 CFU ml-1. Larvae were administered probiotics daily for the first six days, challenged with pathogens on the third day and then reared until settlement (day 19). Although protection against pathogen attack was observed in combination treatments, when compared with single-strain administration, additive protection was not apparent. Administration of 108 CFU ml-1 levels of probiotics, both singly and in combination, afforded larval survival slightly better than 107 CFU ml-1 levels, although this was rarely statistically significant. On the other hand, the higher levels of probiotic led to smaller larvae and lower feed rates for the majority of the 19-day trial. At the end of the study, larval sizes were smaller in the treatment applied a combination of probiotics at 108 CFU ml-1 than those of the other treatments. Additionally, towards the end of the larval period, feed consumption in the combination 108 CFU ml-1 treatment was similar to that witnessed in the other probiotic treatments one day previously. This suggested that either the larvae were compromised or they were growing slower. Despite a lack of additive protection against a single strain pathogen attack being demonstrated, the potential benefit of multi-strain probiotics, as prophylactic measures against every-day microbial encounters in larviculture, would remain. Although 108 CFU ml-1 levels appeared to protect against pathogen attack slightly better, they were also potentially detrimental to normal larval rearing when administered in combination. Following the successful completion of the larval period and pathogen protection afforded with a combination of probiotics at 107 CFU ml-1, this level was recommended as the best concentration of each probiotic where combination administration would be applied. The work presented in this thesis supports the use of A. macleodii 0444 and Neptunomonas sp. 0536 in the routine rearing of GSM larvae. The ability to produce settled juvenile mussels, equal in numbers to those produced in normal healthy conditions, plus the benefits against pathogen attack led to the recommendation of their use on a routine prophylactic basis in GSM larval rearing. Their use for this purpose is intended in the near future. A provisional patent has been prepared and will be submitted shortly. It is anticipated that future work will continue with these probiotic strains to determine their potential benefit for other aquaculture species.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Greenshell mussels.</field><field name="subject">Probiotics.</field><field name="subject">Aquaculture.</field><field name="subject">New Zealand.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1036</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organisational implementation of storage area networks as a strategic knowledge managment tool.</field><field name="creator">Jamoo, George</field><field name="description">University of Technology, Sydney.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1101</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diversity and systematics of Peyssonneliaceae (Rhodophyta) from Vanuatu and southeastern Australia</field><field name="creator">Dixon, Kyatt R.</field><field name="description">The thesis investigates members of the crustose and largely calcified red algal family Peyssonneliaceae through molecular analyses and anatomical and ultrastructural observations.

However, it is unclear whether nutritional requirements differ between genotypes. A series of experiments compared young (4 - 12 months) red deer and red deer-elk cross (hybrids) in various aspects of their nutrition.  Single genotype groups (10-15) of red deer and hybrid weaner stags were offered one of four pasture allowances (2 to 12 kg DM/head/day) on a rotationally grazed mixed ryegrass - white clover pasture system for 9 weeks in winter (June-July), spring (October-December) and summer (February - March). Stags were weighed and given a new allocation of pasture weekly. Pre-grazing pasture mass ranged from 800 kg DM/ha for low pasture allowances to 4500kg DM/ha for higher allowances. Winter live-weight gain was low (40-80 g/day), relatively unaffected by pasture allowance and similar for both genotypes. In spring however, hybrids gained live-weight on average 100 g/day more than red deer across all pasture allowances and the response to additional pasture allowance was large (110 g/day at 2kg DM/head/day to 300 g/day at 9.5 kg DM/head/day). At the highest pasture allowance, hybrids grew faster (350 g/day) than red deer (250 g/day), although red deer were able to achieve this live-weight gain when offered less pasture (4 vs 12 kg DM/head/day, respectively). Summer live-weight gain was lower for both genotypes and responded less to increases in pasture allowance than during spring.  A second experiment compared the live-weight gain of both genotypes at ad lib feeding in an indoor environment where intake could be accurately measured. A group of red deer (n =15) and a group of hybrid (n =15) weaner stags were housed indoors during winter (3 June - 27 August) and spring (16 October - 16 December) and fed a pelleted grain based ration ad lib. Mean daily intake for each group (kg DM/head/day) was calculated as the difference between feed offered and feed refused. Hybrids had a significantly higher (P&lt; 0.05) absolute DM intake compared with red deer in both seasons, although when expressed on a metabolic body weight basis, there was no difference between genotypes irrespective of season. Live-weight gain during winter did not differ significantly between genotypes regardless of whether it was expressed on an absolute or metabolic weight basis. Spring live-weight gain, expressed both on an absolute and metabolic live-weight basis, was significantly higher for hybrids compared with red deer (P&lt;0.05). Red deer and hybrids increased their feed intake from winter to spring by 20% and 24% respectively on a metabolic body weight basis. Although the difference between genotypes in their seasonal increase in intake was relatively small there was a large difference in their pattern of live-weight gain. Red deer exhibited a 34% and hybrids a 76% seasonal increase in live-weight gain expressed on a metabolic live-weight basis from winter to spring. These results indicate the greater rate of live-weight gain displayed by hybrids compared with red deer was not associated with a greater ad lib intake (expressed on a metabolic body weight basis) and the seasonal increase in live-weight gain is greater for hybrids than for red deer.  A further experiment estimated the energy requirement for maintenance of both genotypes. Five deer of each genotype were housed in separate pens (3.5m&#178;) during winter (3 June - 27 August) and spring (16 October - 16 December) and randomly assigned to one of 5 feeding levels (0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, or 0.9 times estimated ad lib intake of l.5 and l.7 kg DM/head/day during the winter and 3.0 and 3.3 kg DM/head/day during the spring for red deer and hybrids, respectively. Maintenance requirement was determined by regression analysis of live-weight gain on ME intake. Although there was no seasonal effect on the live weight gain response to intake there was a significant genotype effect. To maintain live weight during either season, hybrids required a higher ME intake (0.52 MJ ME/W0.75/day compared with red deer 0.41 MJ ME/W0.75/day). The rate of increase in live weight gain to increasing intake declined as intake increased and more so for red deer than hybrids.  The final experiment in the series involved individually housed deer and aimed to more precisely determine differences in maintenance requirement and examine the difference in composition of gain between genotypes. In addition, in vivo apparent DM digestibility was measured in both genotypes.  Red deer (n=7) and hybrid weaner stags (n=7) were housed in individual pens for a period of 8 weeks in both winter (July - August) and spring (November - December) and offered one of 7 feeding levels which ranged from maintenance to ad lib. During each 8 week experimental period, live weight gain, apparent digestibility and feed intake were measured. Immediately prior to, and at the conclusion of each 8 week period body composition was estimated using computer-assisted topography (CT scan).  In winter, there was no significant difference in the live weight gain response to intake although red deer tended to have a higher (44 vs 55 MJ/kg) requirement for gain than hybrids. In spring, red deer had a lower requirement for maintenance (0.35 vs 0.47 MJ ME/W0.75/day) but a greater requirement for live weight gain (64 vs 35 MJ/kg) than hybrids. In spring, mean ad lib intake was about 30% higher than in winter and was greater for hybrids than for red deer. Energy retention in whole body (kJ/W0.75/day) did not differ between genotypes in either winter or spring but both the energy requirement for zero energy balance (0.59 vs 0.48 MJ ME/W0.75/day) and the efficiency of utilisation (0.37 vs 0.24) was greater in spring than in winter. The disparity between live weight gain and whole body weight gain may have been due to differences in gut fill.  There was no significant difference between genotypes in relative growth coefficients for lean, bone or adipose tissue in whole body. However hybrids tended to have a higher winter and lower spring growth coefficient for fat compared with red deer. Growth coefficients for adipose, lean and bone, respectively were 0.983, 1.063 and 1.026 for winter and 1.02, 0.708 and 1.727 for spring. At the same whole body weight, deer in October had less adipose tissue than in August. It is unclear whether this represents a strategy for rapid spring growth or is an artefact of experimental protocol.  Apparent dry matter digestibility (DMD) did not differ between genotypes but was higher by between 7 and 15 percentage units in winter compared with spring. Unexpectedly, digestibility was positively correlated with intake. Digestibility increased by 2.6 percentage units for every 10g DM/W0.75/day increase in either season in one group and 4.1 and 2.1 percentage units for deer in winter and spring respectively in another group. Errors in faecal collection were discounted as causes of the unexpected result.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">red deer</field><field name="subject">Cervus elaphus</field><field name="subject">elk</field><field name="subject">hybrid</field><field name="subject">nutrition</field><field name="subject">metabolism</field><field name="subject">liveweight gain</field><field name="subject">070204 - Animal Nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/2166</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Exploration of the Role of School Principals in Faith Formation Leadership Within the Educational Mission of Two Australian Anglican Schools</field><field name="creator">Moody, Craig William</field><field name="description">This study offers a response to the question facing the Australian Anglican Church about how the mission of Anglican schools is aligned with the mission of the whole Church. The study explores two Anglican school principals&#8217; faith formation leadership, as they engage in this mission. Fundamental to understanding the context of this study is awareness of Anglicanism&#8217;s broad variety of expression balanced with unity through Scripture, Reason and Tradition. In spite of differences, the Anglican Church seeks the &#8216;Via Media&#8217;, the middle way, held together in a dynamic tension of debate. Anglican school principals lead faith formation in this context of diversity, which leads to the purpose of this study: to explore two Australian Anglican school principals&#8217; perceptions of their role and capability as school leaders of faith formation within the Anglican Church&#8217;s mission. The three questions guiding this study relate to the ways in which the principals understand their role, their capability for the role, and the ways in which the Anglican Church has equipped them to be faith formation leaders in their schools. Various Anglican sources note that these questions have been on the Anglican Church&#8217;s agenda for several decades. A recent report on the governance relationship between an Australian Anglican Diocese and its schools noted lack of Anglican identity and role definition of schools&#8217; mission in the Church as significant issues (Nicholson, 2007), and this appears to be the case in faith formation leadership also. Underpinning this study are assumptions that the nurturing of the Christian faith in the Anglican tradition is a core task of Anglican schools as agents of Anglican mission, and that the principal of an Anglican school plays a key role in leading faith formation by authentic personal Christian witness. In this study, Anglican school faith formation leadership has been explored in cultural and symbolic dimensions of leadership. Catholic and Lutheran schools&#8217; faith formation leadership practices are reviewed to inform the study. This exploratory, qualitative study has an orientation of social constructionism, seeking two purposively sampled Australian Anglican school principals&#8223; perceptions from an open research stance. A theoretical framework of symbolic interactionsism has valued the participants&#8217; context. A phenomenological research methodology has used data gathering methods of interview, survey questionnaire, observation and documentary analysis. The study indicates that areas for further study include the shared faith formation leadership roles of principals and school chaplains; the fostering of a culture of research about Anglican school faith leadership; the provision of professional mentoring for principals; the relationship of principals to the Anglican Church; and provision by the Anglican Church of guiding statements and training to equip principals for their faith leadership roles.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anglican Church</field><field name="subject">Anglican school principals</field><field name="subject">Faith formation</field><field name="subject">Leadership</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp234.01072010</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living.

The WL has been trading in Auckland City&#8217;s central business district for almost fifty years. The WL opens in the early evening and remains open until the early morning hours. At closing, the WL is towed to a storage area where it remains until this process is repeated. This daily pattern has occurred since the WL opened in 1948. Because of its longevity, the WL, and many of its stakeholders have experienced ongoing change as Auckland City has grown, and competition within fast food has increased. Thus, for many stakeholders, the WL is representative of their lives, a mirror of their reality and life experiences. Obviously, these realities and experiences are different for different stakeholders. In this thesis, I examine the contested &#8220;White Lady&#8221; (WL): the perceptions and the social meanings that its stakeholder groups attribute to it. This thesis illuminates differences and similarities within stakeholder viewpoints and in doing so defines that pie carts like the WL are a valid part of New Zealand&#8217;s culinary and social cultures Ultimately, this thesis provides a platform of knowledge from which stakeholders and others can come to understand and know the differing and similar views that other stakeholder groups hold. With this in mind, this research ranges in scope from the examination of city administration to the symbolism associated with the (WL) by some of its stakeholders. Therefore, this research is founded within socio-historic constructs: the history of fast food and, the similarities that this history holds to today&#8217;s WL operation. The contextualisation of hospitality within &#8220;three domains&#8221; (Lashley, 2004, p.13) aids in defining the WL as well as recognising the competitive growth of New Zealand&#8217;s fast food industry. This research suggests that fast food growth and subsequent competition have had negative impacts upon many small fast food outlets including the WL. viii The growth of fast food has facilitated a &#8220;slow food&#8221; (Jones, Shears, Hiller Comfort and Lowell, 2003, p. 298) movement. This movement coupled with the hierarchy of food typologies, adds a Saussurian overlay and sociological discourse to this work. This overlay clarifies for the reader Bourdieu&#8217;s (1984) position that all food is reflective of class status. Within postmodernist constructs and the rise of the individual, (and the consequent opportunity to hear &#8216;voices from the margins&#8217;), movement within class and individuality within New Zealand&#8217;s wider culture has occurred. Social change therefore, has facilitated some of the issues within WL contestation. In highlighting Bourdieu&#8217;s (1984) concept, the &#8220;binary opposition&#8221; (Levi-Strauss, 1981, as cited in Adamenko, 2007, p.27) inherent within food hierarchies and, as often expressed within the media, is examined. This examination reveals that while the media inform, this information often contributes to the polarisation of opinion that facilitates the formation of contested viewpoints by WL stakeholders. It is against a backdrop of compliance need, the absence of an official street trading policy, the differing views of stakeholders, and the intensification of competition in fast food, coupled with a lacuna in the knowledge base of younger Auckland residents regarding the WL that this research finds its voice.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fast food</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Contestation</field><field name="subject">Hospitality</field><field name="subject">Pie cart</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/818</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organisational prerequisites to fund, implement and sustain Maori health promotion in a primary care setting</field><field name="creator">Brown, Rachel</field><field name="description">M&#257;ori are the indigenous people of New Zealand. As a population group M&#257;ori have on average the poorest health status of any ethnic group in New Zealand (Ministry of Health, 2007). Much of this disproportionate ill-health is linked to manageable and/or preventable conditions. Given this, there is much scope for effective M&#257;ori health promotion in particular, as the M&#257;ori population is relatively young. The primary objective of the case study research was to determine the organisational pre-requisites necessary to fund, implement and sustain M&#257;ori health promotion within a primary care setting. Secondary aims were to; identify how health promotion is perceived within a &#8216;M&#257;ori&#8217; primary health care setting, identify existing health promotion practice, and test the feasibility of implementing a current M&#257;ori health promotion framework. The case study research was informed by 19 key informant interviews and two focus group sessions. A literature review including an organisational document review was also undertaken. Findings indicated that many of the pre-requisites necessary for effective M&#257;ori health promotion implementation sat outside the scope of the organisation and needed to come from a variety of sources including the Ministry of Health, District Health Board&#8217;s (DHB&#8217;s), community organisations and health providers, wh&#257;nau (family), hap&#363; (sub tribe) and iwi (tribe), including support from other sectors. The research also found a number of underlying issues that impacted greatly on the health of the M&#257;ori population within the PHO. These issues need to be addressed at a number of levels and given high New Zealand priority. In testing the feasibility of a current M&#257;ori health promotion model (Kia Uruuru Mai a Hauora) it was considered by participants to fit well with the goals, principles and values of the case study site and within primary health care in general, complementing critical health care service delivery components that already exist. The study&#8217;s conclusion found that there was much scope for M&#257;ori health promotion that was fully supported, recognised, and adequately and appropriately resourced by the New Zealand Government, Ministry of Health and DHB&#8217;s in order to provide long term cost effective and sustainable health benefits.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori health promotion</field><field name="subject">primary care</field><field name="subject">health promotion</field><field name="subject">health promotion models</field><field name="subject">Maori health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/938</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In the company of strangers: Negotiating the parameters of indeterminacy; A study of the roaming body and departure in urban spaces</field><field name="creator">Baker , Mike</field><field name="description">This performance-based project scrutinizes indeterminacy as a mediating force impinging upon our behaviour and its subsequent impact on the nature and constituency of engagements and dialogue between people in urban spaces. Concepts centering on the dynamics of departure are being investigated with focus upon the Multi User Virtual Environment (MUVE), Second Life as a facet of real life (the term 'real life' will henceforth be referred to in this document within the context of Second Life, as First Life). Experienced through the vehicle of the Roaming Body, our meetings and encounters with people and places frequently manifest as disjunct communiqu&#233;s and mis-engagements. I am asserting that this is due to the inevitability in our existence of indeterminacy acting as a significant factor in the articulation of our relations with others, reinforcing our description as time-based entities traversing the passage of the everyday. I maintain that this is frequently evidenced in our behaviours through the occurrence (notwithstanding arrivals) of a continual, pre-emptive state of departure. Indeterminacy implies motion and emerges, as Massumi asserts, through &#8216;&#8230; an unfolding relation to its own nonpresent potential to vary &#8230;&#8217;. We, as humans, are constantly being drawn away &#8211; always either approaching or embracing involuntarily, a 'state-of-Leaving&#8217; which co-mingles with and unerringly erodes our efforts to stay engaged with another in the here and now. In my dance and video practice, interventionist dance strategies are being used to prompt and interrogate the constituents of departure within encounters in designated public places. Experimental movement frameworks employed are informed by the discipline of Contact Improvisation Dance and Authentic Movement. The working process is being documented using a range of video narrative.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en_NZ</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indeterminacy</field><field name="subject">Roaming body</field><field name="subject">Leaving</field><field name="subject">Mixed-reality</field><field name="subject">Performance</field><field name="subject">Narrative</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/937</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular characterisation of Shigella flexneri outer membrane protease IcsP.</field><field name="creator">Tran, Elizabeth Ngoc Hoa.</field><field name="description">Shigella is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria responsible for bacillary dysentery in humans. Shigella flexneri type 2a in particular is responsible for the majority of incidents in developing countries. The S. flexneri protease IcsP, is a member of the Omptin family of outer membrane (OM) proteases which cleaves IcsA, a polarly localised OM protein required for Shigella virulence. Mutations in icsP have been shown to effect the observed distribution of IcsA, however the significance of IcsP in Shigella virulence is incompletely understood. In this study, aspects of IcsP biology were investigated. S. flexneri 2457T and M90T icsP mutants were constructed to investigate the role of IcsP in Shigella intercellular spread, and it was found that icsP in both S. flexneri backgrounds did not appear to be essential for cell-tocell spread in human cervical cancer HeLa cells, but enhanced cell-to-cell spread in monkey kidney CV-1 cells (as determined by plaque assays). Complementation with icsP returned the mutant phenotype to wild-type. The results suggest IcsP does play a role in Shigella intercellular spread. The 2457T icsP mutant was subsequently complemented with an altered icsP gene encoding a haemagglutinin epitope tagged IcsP (IcsPHA) to determine the distribution of IcsP on the cell surface. In both S. flexneri and E. coli K-12 possessing smooth and rough lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the distribution of IcsPHA was found to be punctate across the cell surface. Deconvolution analysis revealed that IcsP distribution was punctate and banded in both LPS backgrounds. A smooth LPS E. coli K-12 yfdI mutant strain expressing IcsPHA was also constructed, and experiments involving treatment of this strain with bacteriophage Sf6 tail spike protein suggested that LPS O antigen chains masked IcsP in smooth LPS strains. During these studies, double-labelling of IcsPHA and LPS in a S. flexneri 5a M90T strain revealed a helical distribution of LPS in this strain. Overall, the results suggest IcsP has a punctate, banded distribution across the cell surface. The effect of virK and rmlD mutations on IcsP was then investigated by constructing a virK, rmlD and virK/rmlD double mutant in S. flexneri 2457T. Western immunoblotting showed no change in IcsP expression levels in either the virK, rmlD or virK/rmlD mutants compared to wild-type. Surprisingly, the virK mutant showed no change in IcsA expression levels by Western immunoblotting and plaque assays (using HeLa and CV-1 cells) suggested that virK was not essential for Shigella intercellular spread (contradicting the published data on this gene). No effect was also observed on IcsP expression level or on IcsP&#8217;s ability to cleave IcsA into culture supernatants. Finally alternative substrates for the protease activity of IcsP were investigated against known Omptin substrates (plasminogen, &#945;2-antiplasmin, complement, protamine and colicins). However, IcsP appeared to have no effect on these substrates as determined by proteolytic cleavage assays and antimicrobial assay. Interestingly, Plg cleavage by rough LPS S. flexneri, and &#945;2AP cleavage by both smooth and rough LPS S. flexneri, was observed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shigella flexneri; IcsP; Outer membrane; Protease</field><field name="subject">Shigella flexneri Molecular genetics.

The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of milk protein ingredients on physico-chemical properties of rice starch : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology at Massey University Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Noisuwan, Angkana</field><field name="description">The overall aim of this thesis is to determine if the interactions between normal and waxy rice starch and milk proteins from four milk protein ingredients, namely skim milk powder (SMP), milk protein concentrate (MPC), sodium caseinate (NaCAS) and whey protein isolate (WPI) do occur, and to identify the mechanisms underlying these interactions. Different milk protein ingredients at various concentrations (0 to 10%, w/w) affected markedly and differently the pasting behaviour of 10% (w/w) rice starches. SMP delayed the pasting of both rice starches by increasing the onset temperature (Tonset) and the peak viscosity temperature (Tpeak) of pasting. This was mainly due to the presence of lactose and ions, which was further supported by the investigation of the effects of UFSMP (a solution of salts and lactose present in SMP at their proper concentration) and lactose. The addition of NaCAS also delayed the pasting of rice starch; Tpeak in the case of both starches was increased. For normal rice starch paste, MPC and WPI decreased the Tpeak. MPC had no affect on Tpeak of waxy rice starch paste. The qualitative viscoelastic behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient gels obtained from the above pastes was dominated by the continuous phase made of the starch molecules. There was evidence, as indicated by confocal microscopy, of phase separation between the milk proteins of SMP and MPC and the two starches. The phase separation was not observed in the addition of either NaCAS or WPI. Studies on the thermal behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient mixtures by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that SMP, similarly to UFSMP, delayed the gelatinization of both starches. NaCAS also delayed the gelatinisation of both starches but had a greater effect on waxy than normal rice starch. The addition of NaCAS did not affect Tonset but increased Tpeak for normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinisation temperature of waxy rice starch was highly affected by the addition of NaCAS with both Tonset and Tpeak shifted to higher temperatures. MPC had no affect on the gelatinization temperature of normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinization temperature of waxy rice starch was increased by the addition of MPC. The addition of WPI to both rice starches showed two thermal transitions. The first of these was due to the gelatinisation of the starches and the second to the denaturation of &#223;-lactoglobulin (&#223;-lg). The addition of WPI to normal rice starch showed that the thermal behaviour of normal starch and protein were independent from each other. In contrast, the thermal behaviour of waxy rice starch was modified by the addition of WPI; both Tonset and Tpeak were increased. SMP decreased the Tonset of swelling, swelling ratio and the amount of starch leaching from both starches. These observed changes were due to the presence of lactose and ions in SMP. NaCAS slightly increased Tonset of swelling but the amount of starch leaching was reduced for both rice starches. The rigidity of both starches tended to increase in the presence of NaCAS. MPC and WPI affected the swelling behaviour of normal and waxy rice starch differently. A dramatic increase in the swelling of normal rice starch/MPC or WPI mixtures was observed, whereas this trend was not evident for waxy rice starch/ MPC or WPI mixtures. The difference in the water holding ability and gelatinization peak temperatures of the two starches over the temperature range at which whey proteins denature and form gels are believed to be responsible for the observed differences. The results from confocal microscopy showed that milk proteins, such as a-casein, &#223;- casein, &#223;-lg and a-lactalbumin (a-la), were adsorbed onto the granule surface of both normal and waxy rice starch. The mechanism for this adsorption is the hydrophilic interactions; hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl group from terminated glucan molecule that protrude around starch granule surface-hydroxyl; amino, or other electron-donation or electron-accepting groups of the added proteins. Using sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) it was found that for SMP and MPC the adsorbed as- to &#223;-casein ratio on both starches was similar to the as-casein to &#223;- casein ratio in the casein micelle at low SMP and MPC concentrations. But at high concentrations of SMP or MPC, this ratio decreased indicating that more &#223;-casein was adsorbed preferentially to as-casein. In the case of NaCAS, as-casein was adsorbed preferentially to &#223;-casein. Moreover, there was evidence of multilayer adsorption of ascasein into the surface of rice starch granules. Compared to the other milk protein ingredients, very small amounts of the &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI were adsorbed onto starch granules. However, the adsorbed amounts of &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI continuously increased with increasing WPI concentration, suggesting that these two proteins, particularly &#223;-lg, adsorbed in multilayers too.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">waxy rice starch</field><field name="subject">lactoglobulin</field><field name="subject">gelatinazation</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290104 Other food sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/905</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The tensions facing a board of trustee model within the cultural framework of kura kaupapa Maaori : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts in Social Policy at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stokes, Kanewa</field><field name="description">This study originated from personal experience, as a member of a Board of Trustee (BOT) within Kura Kaupapa Maaori (KKM). The workload required for Kura compliance with government regulation and legislation, was phenomenal. The BOT model seemed to be structured on a corporate model of governance with accountability to the Ministry of Education. This contradicted with the needs of Kura whaanau to be involved in Kura decisionmaking. The BOT model unintentionally created a separation and tension between whaanau and BOT members. This research set out to explore the BOT model of governance within our Kura, from a cultural perspective, rather, than researching problems identified by ERa. The research undertook a review of the literature that placed the BOT model within the 1984 -1990 Economic Reforms. It highlighted the impact of past government policies, and administration, on the Maaori language and culture to illuminate the cultural, economic, political and social context of the establishment of Kura Kaupapa Maaori and the doctrine of Te Aho Matua (TAM). The BOT model, and KKM/TAM, are founded on differing values. The study was approached from a Kaupapa Maaori perspective; not wishing to reaffirm the negative stigma of past research undertaken of Maaori. The objectives of the study were to gain an understanding of whaanau cultural capacity, perceptions and understanding of KKM and TAM; and also, whaanau understanding of the BOT model. The research design consisted of a case study. This involved a questionnaire to all whaanau; and in-depth discussions with a sample of twelve whaanau. Appropriate ethical considerations were given to the process, which addressed both academic and cultural needs. Findings clearly identify the structure, and nature of the BOT model, being problematic within the cultural framework of a KKM underpinned by Te Aho Matua. The values and principles between the model and TAM fundamentally conflict. Findings also identify key factors, that both government and Kura whaanau can utilise, in advancing whaanau governance.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kura kaupapa Maori</field><field name="subject">school administration</field><field name="subject">school boards</field><field name="subject">boards of trustees</field><field name="subject">ethnic schools</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/910</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rheo-NMR studies of macromolecules : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Physics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kakubayashi, Motoko</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the effects of simple shear flow on macromolecular structure and interactions are investigated in detail via a combination of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and rheology, namely Rheo-NMR. A specially designed NMR couette shear cell and benchtop shear cell, developed in-house, demonstrated that the direct measurement of the above phenomena is possible. First, to determine whether the shear cells were creating simple shear flow, results were reproduced from literature studies of liquid crystal systems which report shear effects on: Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) in deuterium oxide, and Poly(gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PBLG) in m-cresol. Next, the possible conformational changes to protein structure brought about by shear were investigated by applying shear to Bovine  -lactogobulin ( -Lg). As the protein was sheared, a small, irreversible conformational change was observed by means of one-dimensional and two-dimensional 1H NMR with reasonable reproducibility. However, no observable change was detected by means of light scattering. A large conformational change was observed after shearing a destabilized  -Lg sample containing 10% Trifluoroethanol (TFE) (v/v). From an NMR point of view, the sheared state was similar to the structure of  -Lg containing large amounts of  -helices and, interestingly, similar to the structure of  -Lg containing  -sheet amyloid fibrils. Gel electrophoresis tests suggested that the changes were caused by hydrophobic interactions. Unfortunately, this proved to be difficult to reproduce. The effect of shear on an inter-macromolecular interaction was investigated by applying shear during an enzyme reaction of pectin methylesterase (PME) on pectin. Experimental method and analysis developments are described in detail. It was observed that under the conditions studied, shear does not interfere with the de-esterification of pectin with two types of PME, which have different action mechanisms at average shear rates up to 1570 s-1.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">macromolecular structure</field><field name="subject">shear</field><field name="subject">pectin</field><field name="subject">protein interactions</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240300 Atomic and Molecular Physics; Nuclear and Particle Physics, Plasma Physics::240301 Atomic and molecular physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/976</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accelerating classifier training using AdaBoost within cascades of boosted ensembles : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Sciences at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Susnjak, Teo</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to address current problems encountered when training classifiers within the framework of cascades of boosted ensembles (CoBE). At present, a signifi- cant challenge facing this framework are inordinate classifier training runtimes. In some cases, it can take days or weeks (Viola and Jones, 2004; Verschae et al., 2008) to train a classifier. The protracted training runtimes are an obstacle to the wider use of this framework (Brubaker et al., 2006). They also hinder the process of producing effective object detection applications and make the testing of new theories and algorithms, as well as verifications of others research, a considerable challenge (McCane and Novins, 2003). An additional shortcoming of the CoBE framework is its limited ability to train clas- sifiers incrementally. Presently, the most reliable method of integrating new dataset in- formation into an existing classifier, is to re-train a classifier from beginning using the combined new and old datasets. This process is inefficient. It lacks scalability and dis- cards valuable information learned in previous training. To deal with these challenges, this thesis extends on the research by Barczak et al. (2008), and presents alternative CoBE frameworks for training classifiers. The alterna- tive frameworks reduce training runtimes by an order of magnitude over common CoBE frameworks and introduce additional tractability to the process. They achieve this, while preserving the generalization ability of their classifiers. This research also introduces a new framework for incrementally training CoBE clas- sifiers and shows how this can be done without re-training classifiers from beginning. However, the incremental framework for CoBEs has some limitations. Although it is able to improve the positive detection rates of existing classifiers, currently it is unable to lower their false detection rates.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CoBE framework</field><field name="subject">classifiers</field><field name="subject">classification algorithms</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280212 Neural networks, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1002</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The physiological effects of pseudoephedrine on endurance cycling : a thesis submitted in the partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Sport and Exercise Science, Massey University (Palmerston North, New Zealand)</field><field name="creator">Mouatt, Joshua Roger</field><field name="description">Background: Pseudoephedrine (PSE) is a mild central nervous system stimulant that when consumed at a high dosage has the potential to alter physiological and psychophysical responses. PSE is widely accessible as over-the-counter medication and despite limited research into PSE at high dosages or its effects on prolonged exercise (&gt;2 hours) is no-longer on the World Anti-Doping Association&#8217;s banned substance list. Currently unrestricted in sport and with no real understanding of the abovementioned responses during endurance exercise there is a high potential for abuse in sport. A recent study performed in our laboratory found PSE to improve self-paced cycling performance in some individuals, however no physiological measurements were taken Purpose: The primary purpose of this study was to determine the physiological effects of PSE at a dosage previously shown to improve performance (2.5 mg/kg) in some individuals during prolonged cycling. A secondary purpose of this study was to assess the effect on endurance cycling performance. Methods: In a randomized, double-blind and counter-balanced design, ten welltrained cyclists participated in two trials, consisting of 120 min of fixed-intensity cycling at 65% VO2max followed by a set work, self-paced time-trial (TT) of ~30 min, following ingestion of either 2.5 mg/kg PSE or visual-matched glucose placebo. Venous blood samples were collected before and during exercise, along with body temperatures and heart rate. Perceived effort and expired gas samples were collected during exercise. Exercise and diet was controlled ~48-hours prior to the trials. Results: Mean heart rate was significantly higher with PSE (P = 0.028) during fixed-intensity exercise. Blood glucose concentrations were significantly lower with PSE (P &lt;0.001) for the first 40 min of fixed-intensity exercise. Respiratory exchange ratio was lower in the final 20-min of fixed-intensity and TT with PSE. Blood lactate, perceived effort, ventilation, and body temperatures were not significantly different between conditions during exercise, nor was TT performance; however individual response was variable. Conclusions: PSE ingestion increased heart rate during endurance cycling and initially suppressed carbohydrate release into the bloodstream while increasing fat oxidation in the later stages of exercise. Despite individual responses, endurance cycling performance remained unchanged with PSE ingestion.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cycling performance</field><field name="subject">physiological measurements</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321400 Human Movement and Sports Science::321401 Exercise physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1013</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality assessment and ethnicity : a New Zealand study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand.

To date there has only been two published studies that have used New Zealand relevant ethnic groups when analysing whether personality measures used in pre-employment settings exhibit different mean scores. The present thesis performed a systematic evaluation on the impact of ethnicity on personality traits. The study examined the impact of ethnicity on NZ Army Officer applicant personality assessment scores measured by the EPQ-R and GPP-I. Four ethnic groups (NZ Europeans, M&#226;ori, Pasifika, and Asian) were analysed for mean trait score differences among ethnic groups, the stability of these differences across different personality inventories and models, the variance of personality traits, the impact of ethnicity on age and gender relationships with personality traits, and how these differences were related to employment selection outcomes. The analyses revealed that ethnicity did have some impact on mean personality assessment scores used in the study. However, these were mostly small differences among ethnic groups. In addition, most of these differences found on the EPQ-R and the GPP-I were not consistent across inventories and models. There were no significant variance differences found on personality traits among ethnic groups. While initial analysis suggested that ethnicity did not influence the relationship between age and gender on personality assessment, further examination suggested that the relationship between gender and personality was impacted on by ethnicity. There were reassuring results found for New Zealand psychologists and HR specialists, as only two of the twelve traits analysed showed moderate differences on traits that were related to selection outcomes. However, for the NZ Army OSB selection process the findings in the present study indicate that the Lie scale on the EPQ-R and the Vigor trait on the GPP-I may need to be interpreted with caution for Asian and Pasifika groups. These results are discussed in terms of implications for personality theory, measurement, and the direction of future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personality assessment</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised</field><field name="subject">EPQ-R</field><field name="subject">Gordon Personal Profile - Inventory</field><field name="subject">GPP-I</field><field name="subject">ethnic status</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1188</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reflecting diversity or selecting viewpoints : an analysis of the GM debate in New Zealand's media 1998-2002 : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of PhD in Communication at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ashwell, Douglas James</field><field name="description">The advent of genetically modified (GM) food in New Zealand in 1998 saw the beginning of a highly politicised debate about GM use in the country. The concern over GM and the political situation after the 1999 general election saw the Government establish a Royal Commission of Inquiry on Genetic Modification in May, 2000. The Royal Commission and strong public opposition to GM, evident in large public protests and other actions, made the issue highly newsworthy. The aim of this study was to explore how newspapers reported the GM debate, in particular, examining whether the reportage facilitated greater public debate and awareness about GM through journalists adhering to the ideals of the theory of social responsibility and enacting their watchdog role as encapsulated in the Fourth Estate tradition of the media. To achieve these aims the overall tone of the reportage and also which news source types and themes were most frequently reported were examined. In addition, the relationship and perceptions of scientists and journalists involved in the reporting were explored to examine how these relationships may have influenced the reportage. Content analysis showed the reportage had a pro-GM bias with policy-makers, scientists and industry spokespeople the most frequently cited news sources. The themes of Science, Economics and Politics dominated the reportage. Other source types and themes were less represented, especially themes dealing with ethical and environmental arguments. This lack of representation occurred despite the Royal Commission offering a space for all interested parties to speak. The interviews illustrated that scientists believed the quality of newspaper coverage of GM lacked depth and that important issues were unreported. Journalists found the issue complex to report and said they took care not to oversimplify the science and issues surrounding GM. The relationship between scientists and journalists indicated particular tensions existing between the two groups. The thesis concludes that if robust public debate is to occur within New Zealand regarding GM and other scientific developments, then the media should reflect a greater diversity of opinion by citing other potential news sources offering alternative arguments based on, for example, ethical or environmental grounds.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">journalism viewpoints</field><field name="subject">newspaper report evaluation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::289900 Other Information, Computing and Communication Sciences ::289999 Other information, computing and communication sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1200</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A case study of the implementation of middle schooling in New Zealand : a thesis submitted in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Education at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Brown, Margaret Anne</field><field name="description">This thesis considers the introduction of middle schooling to the New Zealand education system. It is a case study of a school going through the process of introducing the middle schooling concept. It seeks to identify and explain the considerable challenges that this school faced as it sought to implement this change. This research project began as a study of the factors which hinder and support the implementation of middle schooling structures and practices. It became an analysis of the features of middle schooling that make it such a challenging and problematic innovation. Middle schooling is a set of philosophical concepts, educational practices and structural arrangements for the education of students between the ages of approximately ten and fourteen years. These concepts and practices are based on the premise that students of this age have academic, social, emotional and physical needs which differ from students on either side of this age group. Middle schooling is generally understood to involve integrated curriculum which is delivered through team teaching. This approach to teaching and learning requires high levels of teacher collaboration, flexible workspaces and timetables and high levels of parental support and involvement. Ideally, middle schooling provides a separate school environment for children of this age. A number of school communities in New Zealand have gained government approval to restructure as middle schools and are at various stages in implementing this new form of schooling. The researcher began the study with the intention of developing guidelines to assist school communities to make this transition from the structures and processes of conventional schooling arrangements to those of middle schooling. To this end she initiated a programme of action research in a school that was about to introduce middle schooling arrangements for its middle years students. The innovation began to run into difficulties from an early stage and it became clear that an action research methodology was unsustainable. Instead, the researcher chose to refocus the research problem to a more analytic study of the factors that were impeding the implementation process. The research methodology evolved to that of case study. Observational data were collected in the school over two years. From these data, three factors seemed to be affecting the implementation of the middle schooling changes. These were the way in which leadership was being executed, the attitudes and responses of the teachers and the particularly complex and demanding nature of the middle schooling innovation itself. The data were then re-analysed with respect to these three factors. From this analysis, the researcher came to a number of conclusions about the relative importance and impact of these three factors. In an effort to ascertain whether the experiences of the case school were typical of the difficulties and challenges schools face when implementing middle schooling change, the case findings were cross checked against the experiences of two other schools that were five years or more into the change process. The cross checking found that the experiences of these other schools were very similar to those of the case school. All three found that implementing middle schooling change had been more difficult and demanding than any other innovation they had implemented. This study identified some aspects of leadership and teacher behaviour that may have slowed the implementation process, but these seem to have been secondary to the sheer complexity and challenges involved with this particular form of innovation. An innovation that requires such a shift in values, behaviour, structures and systems from a school community, and one that requires the sustained commitment of the entire staff over an extended period of time, will always prove to be exceptionally challenging. The case study identified five requirements that middle school implementers need to consider in order to implement the concept successfully. Failure to consider any of these requirements is likely to threaten the success of the innovation. The five requirements are: &#8226; The need to develop a shared understanding of the concept rationale and principles and how these will be operationalised within the school; &#8226; The need to develop a shared understanding of the complex, multi-faceted and integrated nature of the innovation and how this will impact on and influence the implementation process; &#8226; The need for strong, visionary, shared leadership; &#8226; The need to gain the interest and operational commitment of the entire staff and a high level of interest and commitment from the parent community and to sustain this for the life of the innovation; and &#8226; The need to develop supportive and appropriate infrastructure within the school to support the innovation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Middle school education</field><field name="subject">Middle schooling</field><field name="subject">Intermediate schools</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1402</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A systematic search for the global minimum structures of Cs, Sn and Au clusters and corresponding electronic properties : a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Assadollahzadeh, Behnam</field><field name="description">Clusters of atoms or molecules form the building blocks of nanoscience and are regarded as a new type of material, as they constitute a bridge between microscopic and macroscopic forms of matter. The experimental and quantum theoretical study of structures, chemical and physical properties and reactivities of nanoclusters represents an innovative and very active field of research, which has resulted in a wide range of applications. Independent of the model used to describe the bonding in these clusters, one of the prime objectives is to find the geometrical arrangement of the atoms or molecules, for a given cluster size, which corresponds to the lowest energy on the potential energy hyper-surface, the global minimum. In order to find such an arrangement, a density functional theory based genetic algorithm code, which is rooted in the Darwinian evolution concept of the survival of the fittest, is developed and utilized to systematically search for the global minimum isomers of homo-nuclear clusters consisting of up to twenty atoms of cesium, tin, gold and of nine atoms of copper. The performance of this algorithm is excellent as numerous energetically lower-lying cluster isomers (compared to those reported in the literature) are found. Extensive valence basis sets together with energy-consistent scalar-relativistic pseudopotentials are employed to optimize the geometry of these clusters and to calculate their electronic properties accurately at the density functional level of theory. Moreover, in collaboration with the Technische Universit??t Darmstadt, the mean static polarizability of tin clusters are measured by a beam deflection method. The qualitative agreement between measured and calculated dipole moments and static electric dipole polarizabilities of tin clusters up to twenty atoms is satisfactory, thus confirming the accuracy of the theoretical models used in this work. Furthermore, the performance of density functional theory in the field of metallophilicity is investigated for dimeric and trimeric [X-M-PH3] compounds (X = Cl, Br, I; M = Cu, Ag, Au) and it is found that the metallophilicity decreases down the group 11 elements of the periodic table of elements.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nanoparticles</field><field name="subject">Metal clusters</field><field name="subject">Cesium</field><field name="subject">Tin</field><field name="subject">Copper</field><field name="subject">Gold</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250100 Physical Chemistry (Incl.

This study explores the interrelated areas of e-learning technology and pedagogy within the context of a postgraduate special education and educational psychology programme. The study is framed in a scholarship of teaching and learning approach and covers three successive phases of overlapping activities of teaching, learning and research. The first phase of the research focuses on the design of a community of practice approach to e-learning. The aim is to enable students to develop their identity as members of the professional community by bridging the gap between university-based learning and its real-world application. In the second phase of the research, alternative technology is used to investigate a better alignment of e-learning technology and pedagogy. The findings here show that a community of practice pedagogy is better aligned with a social constructionist e-learning technology. In the third phase of the research an e-learning alignment guide is developed to analyse the changes in e-learning in relation to the interrelated areas of technology, pedagogy and context. The guide is applied to the e-learning case studies in Phases 1 and 2 of this study. The profiles of alignment from these case studies illustrate the complexities and tensions in e-learning and the potential of linking advanced technologies with effective teaching practices to change the way we teach and learn. The key finding of this study is that careful alignment of technology, pedagogy and context is needed to actualise the potential of e-learning in higher education. The e-learning alignment guide developed in this study enables analysis of e-learning environments to provide alignment profiles. Aligning innovative technologies with appropriate pedagogies in different contexts is essential for e-learning to meet the needs of learners in the digital age. The enormous and rapid development of new educational technologies has seriously challenged traditional forms of pedagogy. This study shows that both a scholarship of teaching and learning approach and the use of the e-learning alignment guide can make a positive contribution to designing effective e-learning environments.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tertiary education</field><field name="subject">Distance education</field><field name="subject">Extramural education</field><field name="subject">Higher education</field><field name="subject">Computer-assisted instruction</field><field name="subject">Educational psychology</field><field name="subject">Special education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330107 Educational technology and media</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1403</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An operational framework for improving decentralised agricultural extension : a Ghanaian case study : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Ph. D.) in Agricultural Extension, Massey University, Institute of Natural Resources, Agricultural/Horticultural Systems &amp; Management</field><field name="creator">Okorley, Ernest</field><field name="description">The pressure on the public agricultural extension organisation in Ghana to improve its responsiveness to meet the needs of farmers has increased since the globalisation of trade in the early 1990s. To improve agricultural productivity and the livelihood security of farm households, the Ministry of Food and Agriculture in Ghana decentralised its extension service in 1997. Although this was a critical change in agricultural policy, the extension service has struggled to implement this policy effectively. Further improvement in the situation is hampered because there has been little research published in this area. To provide this understanding, a single-case study of a successful decentralised district level extension organisation in Ghana was used to identify the factors, processes and outcomes that contribute to its performance. The case organisation is an example of a district agricultural extension organisation that operates under a decentralisation system at the level of deconcentration, with a high farmer-to-extension agent ratio and limited and uncertain levels of Government funding. The results of the study emphasised the importance of the effects of both external and internal (or organisational) factors on the performance of the case organisation. The external factors included: (1) the political will to decentralise, (2) the level of decentralisation of other government departments, (3) the provision of a clear legal framework for decentralisation and (4) the existence of established institutions that are willing to support the decentralisation process. New external factors that were identified in this study were (1) the type and drivers of decentralisation, (2) stakeholders' willingness and commitment to support the decentralisation process and (3) the community characteristics in terms of land tenure arrangements and gender roles. The results confirmed the importance of the organisational factors prescribed in the literature: (1) stakeholder participation, (2) managerial and technical capacity, (3) operational funding and (4) accountability. However, the study also identified five other interrelated organisational factors that influenced the success of the case organisation that had not been previously reported in the literature. These included the needs to: (1) develop a needs-based extension programme, (2) expand the extension service focus and roles, (3) foster a cross-sector pluralistic extension approach (4) use needs-based groups for service delivery, and (5) extension staff attitudinal change. Multistakeholder (farmer and other organisations) participation was critical for the development of a needs-based extension programme. The case organisation had modified the traditional extension programme planning process to involve stakeholders at different levels of participation. Similarly, the case organisation involved stakeholders in its multilevel monitoring and evaluation processes. Stakeholder participation in planning and evaluation, although aimed ultimately at efficient and effective programme implementation and improvement, did enhance accountability. Because the case organisation had taken on a broader livelihood security focus to extension, the definition of farmer needs was extended to encompass on-farm and off-farm needs that have impact on the contribution agriculture makes to the livelihood security of farm households in the district. This broader livelihood security focus to extension required the case organisation to take on additional roles from those it traditionally held. In the study, a typology of such roles was developed and a role selection process used by the case organisation during its programme planning process was described. Similarly, because of this broader focus, the case organisation had to work both across sectors and with other extension providers from within the sector to meet the needs of farmers. Again, the multistakeholder programme planning process was central to fostering coordination and collaboration amongst the various extension providers in the district. Decentralisation has placed greater managerial responsibility on management staff of the case organisation. In addition, the livelihood security focus has required technical staff and attitudinal changes to develop and seek for a much broader range of skills and knowledge - meaning that the development of both managerial and technical capacity was important for the case organisation. Needs-based training, the development of a learning environment and the enhancement of staff motivation were critical for the development of staff capacity. As with other extension organisations in developing countries, the funding for the case organisation was limited and uncertain. To overcome these constraints, the case organisation had in place mechanisms to ensure its resources were used efficiently and that it could mobilise additional resources from outside the organisation. Resource efficiency was improved through an intensive monitoring system and the use of stable needs-based groups. Additional resources were mobilised by lobbying government and international donors for funds for projects that would meet the needs of farmers. Further resources were obtained through collaboration with other stakeholder organisations. Again, the multistakeholder planning process provided a platform for collaboration. Networking and special issue forums also provided mechanisms for enhancing collaboration within the district. Decentralisation was introduced into Ghana in 1997 with the aim of eventually developing a demand-driven extension system. Although viewed as successful, the case organisation has yet to achieve the level of farmer participation (i.e. self-mobilisation) that is required for a demand-driven extension system. Currently, after six years of decentralisation, the level of farmer participation can be classified as somewhere between consultation and collaboration. Therefore, the results of this study suggest that the transition from a top-down to a demand-driven extension system will take considerable time and resources.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Agricultural extension work</field><field name="subject">Agriculture and state</field><field name="subject">Ghana</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300900 Land, Parks and Agriculture Management::300901 Farm management, rural management and agribusiness</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1404</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental effects of densely planted willow and poplar in a silvopastoral system : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Ph. D.) in Agroforestry, Institute of Natural Resources, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hussain, Zaker</field><field name="description">New Zealand, having large areas of hilly landscapes, is subject to the risk of soil erosion, and summer and autumn droughts that limit pasture growth, which in turn affects the livestock-based economy. The nitrogen and phosphorus input in fertilisers coupled with livestock excreta and soil disturbance impose a serious threat to downstream water quality. The planting of trees is one option used to decrease soil erosion, increase the quantity of forage and manage runoff. To date, research has mainly focused on wide spaced poplar trees for feed quality and their effects on understorey pasture growth. However, there is increasing interest in the use of densely planted willow and poplar for fodder purpose. The effects of young (&lt; 5 yrs old) willow and poplar planted at close spacing on runoff, soil erosion, growth of understory pasture and nutrient losses have never been studied in New Zealand. Three field trials (two at Crop and Research Unit, Moginie, Manawatu and one at Riverside Farm, Masterton) were conducted between October 2004 and November 2006 that incorporated comparative establishment and growth of densely planted willow and poplar and their effects on soil moisture, runoff, sediment load and nutrient losses from grazed and fertilised farmland. It was concluded that densely planted willow and poplar (3-4 yrs) reduced total nitrogen (TN) and dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) by 47 % each and sediment load by 52 %. Young trees reduced surface runoff and soil moisture more as they aged. However, due to their deciduous nature willow and poplar were not effective in reducing surface runoff in winter and early spring. Sheep preferred camping under trees, especially in late spring and summer, and this led to greater deposition of dung and urine under trees than open pasture. Sheep grazing, especially in winter, significantly increased sediment and nutrient loads in runoff water. The N and P fertiliser application increased nutrient load in runoff water well above the threshold level required to initiate algal growth to create eutrophication. Densely planted willow and poplar significantly reduced understorey pasture growth by 23 % and 9 %, respectively, in their second year at Moginie, mainly due to shade, but coupled with soil moisture deficit in summer. The pasture growth in a willow browse block was 52 % of that in open pasture as a result of shade and differences in pasture species composition. Sheep browsing reduced willow leaf area significantly. Willow and poplar survival rates were similar (P &gt; 0.05) after two years of establishment (100 % vs 90.5 %, respectively). However, willow grew faster than poplar in height (1.90 vs 1.35 m), stem diameter (43.5 vs 32.6 mm), canopy diameter (69 vs 34 cm) and number of shoots (8.7 vs 2.3) at the age of two years, respectively. The research clearly demonstrated that densely planted young willow and poplar trees can reduce runoff, sediment load and nutrient losses from farmland to freshwater, but shade and soil moisture can limit pasture growth under trees. It is recommended that willow and poplar should be planted at wide spacing on the whole farm to minimise loss of pasture. Where blocks of trees are necessary, such as willow browse blocks, sheep browsing can be used as a tool to reduce shade to improve pasture growth. Livestock access to riparian strips should be minimal to avoid livestock camping that can have deleterious effects on water quality.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Agroforestry</field><field name="subject">Poplar</field><field name="subject">Willow</field><field name="subject">Fodder trees</field><field name="subject">Soil conservation</field><field name="subject">Hill farming</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300600 Forestry Sciences::300606 Agroforestry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1405</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Higher education quality assurance policy and practice in the Maldives : a case study from a small developing nation : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Education at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Maniku, Ahmed Ali</field><field name="description">This thesis comprises a case study of quality assurance policy and practice in the emerging higher education sector of the Maldives. The policy analysis is extended to incorporate a glonacal perspective, allowing analysis of quality assurance policy issues from the global, national and local contexts. In order to illuminate the analysis in the Maldives' primary case study, two secondary less intensive case studies are presented of quality assurance processes from a New Zealand polytechnic and the University of the South Pacific. Documentary evidence and semi-structured interviews from Key Informants form the main evidence base for the study. Data analysis is facilitated using NVivo. The thesis argues that the upsurge in quality assurance in higher education is primarily legitimated within a neoliberal discourse, Urged by transnational organisations such as the World Bank, there is widespread policy convergence in quality assurance. Whilst neoliberalism has had partial effects in the case of the Maldives, the study reveals that neoliberal ideology and the associated strategies of marketisation, privatisation, human resource development and managerialism have shaped quality assurance policy processes in varying degrees in the three cases. Findings in this study contribute to a fuller understanding of quality assurance policy processes in a small developing nation context: a perspective largely missing from current debates on the subject. The findings confirm that a combination of global, national and institutional factors influenced quality assurance policy processes in the Maldives. From the global context, globalisation and internationalisation of higher education trends affect quality assurance policy. At the national level, the desire for higher quality education found expression in the state's reassertion of its role in protecting public interest in regulating the sector through formal quality assurance. The social demand for international comparability has also lead to a growing trend of transnational quality assurance practices. The creation of the Maldives College of Higher Education was shown to be the principal impetus in quality assurance development. This national college played a lead role in developing a quality assurance model that tends to promote a regulatory compliance to quality. The study argues for a more inclusive model that acknowledges external compliance but also seeks to assure quality of teaching and learning leading to improved student outcomes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tertiary education</field><field name="subject">Higher education</field><field name="subject">Quality assurance policy</field><field name="subject">Maldives</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1406</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The human myostatin precursor protein : structure, function and amyloid formation : implications for the muscle wastage disease sporadic inclusion body myositis : a dissertation presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Biochemistry at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Starck, Carlene Sheree</field><field name="description">Myostatin is a major player in the regulation of mammalian muscle growth and development, maintaining the balance between proliferation and differentiation prenatally and the quiescence of satellite cells in adults. An absence or overexpression of myostatin results in double-muscling and cachexia respectively, placing myostatin as a promising target in the treatment of muscle wastage diseases. As a transforming growth factor-&#946; superfamily member, myostatin is produced as a precursor protein, consisting of a propeptide region N-terminal to the growth factor domain. Cleavage of the precursor between the domains forms the myostatin latent complex, an inhibitory structure which is exported from the cell where a second cleavage event releases the active myostatin growth factor. The precursor protein, propeptide, and latent complex play important roles in the regulation of myostatin. However, their structure and function are poorly understood, and a possible role for the myostatin precursor protein in the muscle wastage disease sporadic inclusion body myositis, suggests that pre-growth factor forms of myostatin may be additional important therapeutic targets. This thesis presents an investigation into the structure and function of the myostatin precursor protein, the latent complex, and the propeptide region within these, with comparisons to a mutant form of myostatin responsible for the naturally-occurring double-muscled phenotype of the Piedmontese cattle breed. Results suggest that the diverse functions of the propeptide region are facilitated by regions of intrinsic disorder within a primarily structured domain, and that conformational alterations accompany the precursor to latent complex transition, resulting in a tighter inhibitory structure. Comparative analyses between the wild-type and mutant proteins suggest that the Piedmontese phenotype is due to a reduced capacity for covalent dimerisation and significant structural alterations within the type I receptor-binding domain. Investigation into misfolded myostatin precursor protein found that the precursor is able to form cytotoxic amyloid aggregates and mature fibrils under partially denaturing conditions, suggesting a possible mechanism for the role of the myostatin precursor in sporadic inclusion body myositis. Together, these novel results contribute important information towards an understanding of myostatin structure, function and regulation in both normal and disease scenarios.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Myostatin precursor protein</field><field name="subject">Muscle wastage disease</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1408</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metal accumulation in toadfish, tetractenos glaber, and their prey items</field><field name="creator">Alquezar, Ralph</field><field name="description">Estuaries support productive and diverse ecosystems, based on the abundant food and diverse habitats. However with increasing human pressures, many estuaries along the coastline of Australia have become degraded. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the effects of estuarine metal contaminants on the physiology, and the subsequent accumulation, in the smooth toadfish, Tetractenos glaber, and their prey items in estuaries in the Sydney region, south eastern Australia. Toadfish and sediments were collected during three seasonal sampling periods (June 2002, September 2002 and January 2003) in four estuaries in the Sydney region (Port Hacking River, Cowan Creek, Parramatta River and Lake Macquarie). Sediment and toadfish tissue metal concentrations varied both spatially and temporally, with highest concentrations exhibited in the metal contaminated estuaries (Lake Macquarie and Parramatta River) during spring 2002 and summer 2003. Toadfish accumulated metals in different tissue, however field experiments were limited in determining the main pathways of accumulation. Controlled laboratory kinetic experiments using radioisotopes of 109Cd and 75Se, indicated that differences in the relative contributions of water and food in the accumulation of these metals are generally governed by the physiology of the toadfish and the type of prey eaten. The distribution of metals in fish organs is important for better understanding metal kinetics and their subsequent toxicity. Toadfish exposed to 109Cd in both water or food showed a shift in distribution from gut lining at the end of the uptake phase to the excretory organs, such as liver, by the end of the loss phase, suggesting that the main uptake pathway for water exposure was via the gut and not the gills, due to fish drinking large amounts of water to maintain osmoregulation. There was no appreciable shift in the distribution of 75Se from the uptake or loss phases, being mostly associated with the excretory organs (gills, liver and kidneys). Further investigation into the accumulation of metals in toadfish prey items revealed that differences in uptake and loss of 109Cd and 75Se were influenced by their aqueous speciation, as well as differences in animal physiology, sequestration, storage and excitation mechanisms. The uptake rates and CFs of 109Cd and 75Se were highest, and the biological half-lives the longest, in pygmy mussels, ghost shrimps and polychaetes relative to the semaphore and soldier crabs. Elevated metal concentrations in certain toadfish tissues from the four estuaries were linked to reduced lipid concentrations and increased protein concentrations, which may be detrimental for growth, reproductive output and survivorship of the fish. A closer investigation into the nutritional value and metal concentrations of toadfish prey items in a selected metal contaminated estuary (Parramatta River) revealed that toadfish from the more contaminated sites within the estuary may grow faster due to higher nutritional value of prey items on a local scale, however on a larger spatial scale, this was not evident. Further investigation is required to determine whether larger toadfish size can be attributed to physiological acclimation or genetic resistance through generations of continuous metal exposure. Many studies have assessed metal concentrations in water, sediments and biota in the field, however few studies have combined both field and laboratory experiments to examine the effects of metals on fish physiology and reproduction, and metal transfer pathways in aquatic biota. This study has contributed to a better understanding of metal accumulation and its physiological effects in estuarine biota and highlights the high spatial and temporal variability in responses of organisms to environmental metal pollution.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heavy metals.</field><field name="subject">Estuarine biology.</field><field name="subject">Toadfishes.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1103</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Responsive Workflows: Design, Execution and Analysis of Interruption Policy Models</field><field name="creator">Belinda Melanie Carter</field><field name="description">Business processes form the backbone of all business operations, and workflow technology has enabled companies to gain significant productivity benefits through the automatic enactment of routine, repetitive processes. Process automation can be achieved by encoding the business rules and procedures into the applications, but capturing the process logic in a graphical workflow model allows the process to be specified, validated and ultimately maintained by business analysts with limited technical knowledge. The process models can also be automatically verified at design-time to detect structural issues such as deadlock and ensure correct data flow during process execution. These benefits have resulted in the success of workflow technology in a variety of industries, although workflows are often criticised for being too rigid, particularly in light of their recent deployment in collaborative applications such as e-business. Generally, many events can impact on the execution of a workflow process. Initially, the workflow is triggered by an external event (for example, receipt of an order). Participants then interact with the workflow system through the worklist as they perform constituent tasks of the workflow, driving the progression of each process instance through the model until its completion. For traditional workflow processes, this functionality was sufficient. However, new generation 'responsive' workflow technology must facilitate interaction with the external environment during workflow execution. For example, during the execution of an 'order to cash' process, the customer may attempt to cancel the order or update the shipping address. We call these events 'interruptions'. The potential occurrence of interruptions can be anticipated but, unlike the other workflow events, they are never required to occur in order to successfully execute any process instance. Interruptions can also occur at any stage during process execution, and may therefore be considered as 'expected, asynchronous exceptions' during the execution of workflow processes. Every interruption must be handled, and the desired reaction often depends on the situation. For example, an address update may not be permitted after a certain point, where this point depends on the customer type, and a shipping charge or refund may be applicable, depending on the original and new delivery region. Therefore, a set of rules is associated with each interruption, such that if a condition is satisfied when the event occurs, a particular action is to be performed. This set of rules forms a policy to handle each interruption. Several workflow systems do facilitate the automatic enforcement of 'exception handling' rules and support the reuse of code fragments to enable the limited specification and maintenance of rules by non-technical users. However, this functionality is not represented in a formal, intuitive model. Moreover, we argue that inadequate consideration is given to the verification of the rules, with insufficient support provided for the detection of issues at design-time that could hinder effective maintenance of the process logic or interfere with the interruption handling functionality at run-time. This thesis presents a framework to capture, analyse and enforce interruption process logic for highly responsive processes without compromising the benefits of workflow technology. We address these issues in two stages. In the first stage, we consider that the reaction to an interruption event is dependent on three factors: the progress of the process instance with respect to the workflow model, the values of the associated case data variables at the time at which the event occurs, and the data embedded in the event. In the second stage, we consider that the reaction to each interruption event may also depend on the other events that have also been detected, that is, we allow interruptions to be defined through event patterns or complex events. We thus consider the issues of definition, analysis and enactment for both 'basic' and 'extended' interruption policy models. First, we introduce a method to model interruption policies in an intuitive but executable manner such that they may be maintained without technical support. We then address the issue of execution, detailing the required system functionality and proposing a reference architecture for the automatic enforcement of the policies. Finally, we introduce a set of formal, generic correctness criteria and a verification procedure for the models. For extended policy models, we introduce and compare two alternative execution models for the evaluation of logical expressions that represent interruption patterns. Finally, we present a thorough analysis of related verification issues, considering both the system and user perspectives, in order to ensure correct process execution and also provide support for the user in semantic validation of the interruption policies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">workflow systems</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="subject">verification</field><field name="subject">business processes</field><field name="subject">expression evaluation</field><field name="subject">rules</field><field name="subject">specification</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:202127</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EFFICIENT GRID COMPUTING BASED ALGORITHMS FOR POWER SYSTEM DATA ANALYSIS</field><field name="creator">Mohsin Ali</field><field name="description">The role of electric power systems has grown steadily in both scope and importance over time making electricity increasingly recognized as a key to social and economic progress in many developing countries. In a sense, reliable power systems constitute the foundation of all prospering societies. The constant expansion in electric power systems, along with increased energy demand, requires that power systems become more and more complex. Such complexity results in much uncertainty which demands comprehensive reliability and security assessment to ensure reliable energy supply. Power industries in many countries are facing these challenges and are trying to increase the computational capability to handle the ever-increasing data and analytical needs of operations and planning. Moreover, the deregulated electricity markets have been in operation in a number of countries since the 1990s. During the deregulation process, vertically integrated power utilities have been reformed into competitive markets, with initial goals to improve market efficiency, minimize production costs and reduce the electricity price. Given the benefits that have been achieved by deregulation, several new challenges are also observed in the market. Due to fundamental changes to the electric power industry, traditional management and analysis methods cannot deal with these new challenges. Deterministic reliability assessment criteria still exists but it doesn&#8217;t satisfy the probabilistic nature of power systems. In the deterministic approach the worst case analysis results in excess operating costs. On the other hand, probabilistic methods are now widely accepted. The analytical method uses a mathematical formula for reliability evaluation and generates results more quickly but it needs accurate and a lot of assumptions and is not suitable for large and complex systems. Simulation based techniques take care of much uncertainty and simulates the random behavior of the system. However, it requires much computing power, memory and other computing resources. Power engineers have to run thousands of times domain simulations to determine the stability for a set of credible disturbances before dispatching. For example, security analysis is associated with the steady state and dynamic response of the power system to various disturbances. It is highly desirable to have real time security assessment, especially in the market environment. Therefore, novel analysis methods are required for power systems reliability and security in the deregulated environment, which can provide comprehensive results, and high performance computing (HPC) power in order to carry out such analysis within a limited time. Further, with the deregulation in power industry, operation control has been distributed among many organizations. The power grid is a complex network involving a range of energy resources including nuclear, fossil and renewable energy resources with many operational levels and layers including control centers, power plants and transmission and distribution systems. The energy resources are managed by different organizations in the electricity market and all these participants (including producers, consumers and operators) can affect the operational state of the power grid at any time. Moreover, adequacy analysis is an important task in power system planning and can be regarded as collaborative tasks, which demands the collaboration among the electricity market participants for reliable energy supply. Grid computing is gaining attention from power engineering experts as an ideal solution to the computational difficulties being faced by the power industry. Grid computing infrastructure involves the integrated and collaborative use of computers, networks, databases and scientific instruments owned and managed by multiple organizations. Grid computing technology offers potentially feasible support to the design and development of grid computing based infrastructure for power system reliability and security analysis. It can help in building infrastructure, which can provide a high performance computing and collaborative environment, and offer an optimal solution between cast and efficiency. While power system analysis is a vast topic, only a limited amount of research has been initiated in several places to investigate the applications of grid computing in power systems. This thesis will investigate probabilistic based reliability and security analysis of complex power systems in order to develop new techniques for providing comprehensive result with enormous efficiency. A review of existing techniques was conducted to determine the computational needs in the area of power systems. The main objective of this research is to propose and develop a general framework of computing grid and special grid services for probabilistic power system reliability and security assessment in the electricity market. As a result of this research, grid computing based techniques are proposed for power systems probabilistic load flow analysis, probabilistic small signal analysis, probabilistic transient stability analysis, and probabilistic contingencies analysis. Moreover, a grid computing based system is designed and developed for the monitoring and control of distributed generation systems. As a part of this research, a detailed review is presented about the possible applications of this technology in other aspects of power systems. It is proposed that these grid based techniques will provide comprehensive results that will lead to great efficiency, and ultimately enhance the existing computing capabilities of power companies in a cost-effective manner. At a part of this research, a small scale computing grid is developed which will consist of grid services for probabilistic reliability and security assessment techniques. A significant outcome of this research will be the improved performance, accuracy, and security of data sharing and collaboration. More importantly grid based computing will improve the capability of power system analysis in a deregulated environment where complex and large amounts of data would otherwise be impossible to analyze without huge investments in computing facilities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">power system analysis</field><field name="subject">Grid Computing</field><field name="subject">Grid computing based monitoring and control</field><field name="subject">parallel and distributed computing</field><field name="subject">embedded generation system monitoring and control</field><field name="subject">emerging techniques in power system analysis</field><field name="subject">power system security analysis</field><field name="subject">analysis computing grid</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204801</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metabolic depression in Cyclorana alboguttata and the potential role of the endogenous opioid system and thyroid axis as regulators of aestivation.</field><field name="creator">Sara Kayes</field><field name="description">Metabolic depression is a ubiquitous characteristic of dormancy, allowing animals to survive off limited endogenous fuels supplies for extended periods of time. Metabolic depression is characterised by a complex set of physiological and biochemical changes (respiratory depression, bradycardia, hypophagia and cessation of renal function), in addition to a remarkable ability to prevent or minimise damage usually associated with such depressive changes (e.g. gut and muscle atrophy, renal failure and ischemic injuries). A coordinated shut-down of systems is essential to surviving long periods of dormancy, however, the mechanisms involved in regulating metabolic depression remain poorly understood. Aestivation, a period of dormancy that occurs in response to desiccating environments, provides an excellent model system for investigating the regulation of metabolic depression, because unlike other forms of dormancy such as hibernation, it is not confounded by changes in temperature or PO2 and thus represents a true intrinsic metabolic depression. The green striped burrowing frog, Cyclorana alboguttata, is an abundant species of burrowing frog inhabiting arid to semi-arid regions of Queensland and Northern New South Wales. During the dry season, C. alboguttata aestivates in an underground clay chamber; the aestivating period lasts on average for nine months a year, but in drought conditions may last for as long as several years. In recent years, C. alboguttata has become a well studied organism for investigating the physiological processes involved in aestivation, especially regarding muscle disuse atrophy and gut maintenance. Despite this, our understanding of this frog&#8217;s capacity to metabolically depress remains limited. The first aim of this study was to extend our current knowledge of metabolic depression during aestivation in C. alboguttata. C. alboguttata reduced whole animal metabolism by 82% within five weeks of aestivation. The effects of aestivation on mass specific in vitro tissue metabolic rate (VO2) varied among individual organs, with muscle and liver slices showing significant reductions in metabolism; kidney VO2 was elevated and there was no change in the VO2 of small intestine tissue slices. Organ size was also affected by aestivation, with significant reductions in the mass of all tissues, except the gastrocnemius. These reductions in organ size, combined with changes in mass specific VO2 of tissue slices, resulted in further energy savings to aestivating animals. Mitochondrial VO2 was significantly reduced during aestivation, by an average of 83%; in addition respiratory control ratios (RCRs), a measurement of mitochondrial coupling efficiency, significantly increased during aestivation, suggesting increased mitochondrial coupling efficiency. The second aim of this study was to investigate the potential role of the endogenous opioid system (EOS) and thyroid hormones in the regulation of metabolic depression in C. alboguttata. When incubated in the presence of opioid agonists, liver and muscle tissue slices from Cyclorana alboguttata underwent tissue- and agonist- specific metabolic depression. In most cases, the effect of opioid agonists on metabolism was more pronounced in tissue slices from aestivating animals. The delta (&#948;) opioid agonist DADLE was the most consistent in producing a metabolic depression, however the effect of DADLE on the metabolism of tissue slices was not reversible by the general opioid antagonist naloxone. Gene transcript levels for the &#948;-opioid receptor remained constant in the brain and in the muscle of aestivating C. alboguttata compared to controls. Opioid receptor XOR1 transcript levels also remained constant in the brain during aestivation compared to controls. There was a significant reduction in total thyroid hormone concentration in the plasma of C. alboguttata during aestivation, with thyroxine (T4) decreasing by 75% and an 84% reduction in triiodothyronine (T3). We also examined changes in gene expression of deiodinase 2 (D2) and deiodinase 3 (D3), the major activating and deactivating enzymes of thyroid hormones, respectively. There were no significant changes in gene expression of D2 in the brain or muscle, or of D3 in the brain; however there was a significant down-regulation of D3 transcripts in muscle tissue. In the liver, D2 was significantly down-regulated and D3 showed an increase in transcript levels that was approaching significance. During dormancy energy conservation is a key priority and as such dormant animals undergo a major metabolic depression to conserve their limited endogenous fuel supplies. At the same time, dormant animals are faced with the challenge of maintaining functional organs for immediate use upon arousal. In this study C. alboguttata appeared to selectively down- or up-regulating individual tissues, using both changes in metabolic rate and morphology. This strategy would allow maximal energy savings during aestivation without compromising organ functionality and survival at arousal. In addition, the frogs appeared to decrease rates of mitochondrial proton leak to a greater extent than ATP synthesis, consistent with an increase in mitochondrial coupling efficiency. Again, this ability to selectively down-regulate one process to a greater extent than another allows energy savings to be maximised without compromising processes essential for survival. C. alboguttata can survive in a dormant state for several years and it is hypothesised that these frogs become more energy efficient during aestivation. The regulation of metabolic depression still remains poorly understood. In this study the potential role of the EOS and thyroid hormones in regulating metabolic depression was investigated. The results of this study suggest the &#948;-opioid system may be responsible for the initiation of metabolic depression, while the mu (&#956;) and kappa (&#954;) opioid systems may be important during long term maintenance of aestivation. In addition, the EOS may exert its control over metabolism via both receptor and non-receptor mediated pathways. The significant down-regulation of total thyroid hormones, as well as the changes in gene expression of the thyroid deiodinases indicates thyroid hormones may also play a significant role in regulating metabolic depression. This suggests that the regulation of metabolic depression may involve several interacting systems, or perhaps a &#8216;systems cascade&#8217;.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">down-regulation</field><field name="subject">mitochondria</field><field name="subject">oxygen consumption</field><field name="subject">organ size</field><field name="subject">opioid</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="subject">anuran</field><field name="subject">thyroxine</field><field name="subject">triiodothyronine</field><field name="subject">thyroid deiodinases</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205412</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PROFILES AND INSTRUCTIONAL INTERVENTIONS OF READING COMPREHENSION: A Study of Upper Primary School Students in Urban Sub District BCL in Bandung, Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Sri Tiatri</field><field name="description">International studies have shown the reading competence of Indonesian students to be relatively low compared to other countries. Considering the importance of reading comprehension, the current research has two aims. The first is to provide some insight into the identification of students&#8217; difficulty with reading. The second is to investigate the implementation of innovative methods for teaching reading comprehension in the Indonesian educational context. Both studies were conducted in state upper grade primary schools in Urban Sub District BCL in Bandung, Indonesia. Study One profiled students&#8217; reading performance. Five measurement instruments were developed, written in Indonesian language. The construction of mental models was also introduced. Two hundred and sixty five Grade Five students from eight schools were measured for their competence in decoding, prior knowledge, comprehension monitoring, construction of mental models, reading comprehension specifically related to a particular topic, and their general reading comprehension. The students&#8217; reading performance profiles were very varied. They showed the importance of each component for the achievement of reading comprehension. The profiles also showed the ability for each component of reading comprehension to compensate each other&#8217;s function to enable the students to perform well in reading comprehension. The best-fit model for the data accounted for 47% of students&#8217; performance in reading comprehension. Study Two compared instructional interventions, and examined the way each method worked in the Indonesian educational context. The three instructional intervention methods were Reciprocal Teaching (RT), Instruction prompting students to develop Mental Models (IMM), and Instruction in Question Answering (IQA). Participants were one hundred and twelve students in the Sixth Grade from three primary schools. There were three groups in each school. Group 1 received RT followed by IMM (RT-IMM), Group 2 received IMM followed by RT (IMM-RT), and Group 3 received IQA. Group 3 was considered as the control group, since IQA is the traditional method widely adopted in Indonesia. Instruction was separated into 2 phases. Each phase consisted of four sessions of 30 minutes each over a two-week period. The implementation of IMM-RT tended to improve general reading comprehension more than other methods (RT-IMM and IQA). Interestingly, individuals who had a low performance in the pre-test for construction of mental models, improved their performance in the construction of mental models following implementation of RT at the first phase. The results support a conclusion that the IMM-RT combination is potentially effective for the enhancement of students&#8217; reading comprehension. However, further results showed that, in order to implement RT and IMM in a common state school classroom in Indonesia, the teacher&#8217;s ability to manage and organise the group becomes crucial. Study Three was designed to validate the IMM-RT instructional intervention for improving performances of students with reading comprehension inadequacies, by addressing the limitations found in Study Two. Result showed that IMM-RT had potential for improving students&#8217; performance in reading comprehension. The findings of the current study provide some understanding of reading comprehension in an Indonesian educational context. Moreover, the findings will add to the repertoire of educators about issues that need to be considered in implementing innovative methods for enhancing Indonesian students&#8217; reading comprehension.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reading comprehension</field><field name="subject">decoding</field><field name="subject">prior knowledge</field><field name="subject">comprehension monitoring</field><field name="subject">mental model</field><field name="subject">intervention</field><field name="subject">reciprocal teaching</field><field name="subject">question answering</field><field name="subject">Indonesian context</field><field name="subject">teacher</field><field name="subject">students</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205497</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Middle years students producing digital videos in science.</field><field name="creator">Geoffrey Hilton</field><field name="description">This study investigated the incorporation of student video production into Year 7 science classes and determined associated learning benefits. Availability of digital cameras and movie editing software make student in-class video production a possibility. However, the introduction of technology into classrooms often precedes an understanding of its effective utilisation. While the science classroom was ideal to utilise the audio/visual benefits of video production, a framework to streamline and guide students&#8217; production was needed to ensure productive learning. The writing-to-learn in science model (Prain &amp; Hand, 1996a) and Science Writing Heuristic (Hand &amp; Keys, 1999) were selected to fulfil this role. The adaptation of the writing-to-learn in science model to include video production as a text type coincided with a call from Prain (2006) to extend research to determine the influence of &#8220;new technology-mediated, multimodal learning environments&#8221; (p. 79) on students&#8217; science learning. Two intact Year 7 classes conducted the same science investigation following the writing-to-learn in science model, one class (Yr 7A, N = 21) used digital video to record and report their findings while the other class (Yr 7B, N = 22) used a traditional method of poster making. Students worked in mixed gender and ability groups of three. Data instruments included pretest, posttest, delayed posttest, a repeated question instruments, and content analysis of the students&#8217; final products. Two groups from each class were video tracked throughout their investigations and were later interviewed. Video data were transcribed and analysed to determine patterns of learning behaviour. This study showed that video production fits comfortably into the writing-to-learn in science framework. Making videos in science delivered learning advantages through the audio/visual nature of video production and the learning behaviours the production process elicited. The nature of video, as a visual and oral medium, allowed students to capture their science investigations accurately and then continue to manipulate the content through reviewing and editing. Through video production, students demonstrated heightened awareness of, and responsibility for, the learning of their audience that led to rehearsal of science concepts before filming. Data analysis revealed that video students collaborated, used higher order thinking, and engaged in the underlying scientific concepts more than the poster makers. This study is significant as it explores in a science classroom context, an emerging technology, already widely utilised in students&#8217; out-of-school lives. Science educators are calling for the broadening of what constitutes a scientific text, the greater inclusion and manipulation of multi-modal representations for science students, and an increased emphasis on socio-communicative approaches to science learning. Additionally, incorporation of technology and associated means of learning, authentic to many students&#8217; out-of-school lives, is advocated for the classroom. Student video production in science answers these calls. It achieves this while delivering unique learning benefits that add significantly to student attainment in science. Video production is playing a greater role in acquisition and dissemination of science knowledge. The use of video production in science and society would seem destined to increase exponentially. This study has investigated one application of the use of video production in a middle years science class, however the implications for further research are vast as the technology develops, the societal usage increases, and the scientific applications of video production become more powerful and widespread.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">student video production</field><field name="subject">science</field><field name="subject">audience</field><field name="subject">rehearsal</field><field name="subject">collaboration</field><field name="subject">representation of concepts</field><field name="subject">higher order thinking</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205722</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Digital technologies and multimodal communication in the chemistry classroom</field><field name="creator">Annette Hilton</field><field name="description">Students of chemistry encounter difficulties due to its abstract nature and the need to understand and communicate its concepts on macro, submicro, and symbolic levels using a range of representations and representational modes. Research suggests that when students are required to use multiple representations they have difficulties in understanding individual representations and in negotiating meaning through their use. This study sought to address these issues through the application of digital technologies. The main areas of research that provided a theoretical framework for this study were multiple representations in chemistry education and writing-to-learn in science. Other research in these areas has suggested that a better understanding of multiple representations might enhance students&#8217; chemical literacy; however, limited research has investigated the impact of using digital technologies to create multimodal texts on students&#8217; learning in chemistry, particularly the development of students&#8217; skills in generating and integrating multiple representations. Until recently, much of the writing-to-learn research has focused on written composition. The knowledge-transforming model was proposed by Bereiter and Scardamalia (1987) to explain the influence of written composition on knowledge construction. However, having been developed prior to the time when students had ready access to digital technologies and a consequent capacity to create multimedia and digital texts, this model does not account for the production of such multimodal texts. This study examined the effect of learning experiences that utilised digital technologies to support students in using multiple representations and through writing-to-learn activities to create multimodal texts on learning outcomes in chemistry. The study was conducted in a metropolitan public co-educational high school in Queensland, Australia. Two Year 11 chemistry classes participated in the study, which was conducted in the first term of a 2-year course in which students learn chemistry as a separate discipline. The study consisted of a pilot study and an intervention study with two phases. The pilot study was used to trial the learning activities and data collection instruments and to gain an insight into instructional approaches that might be appropriate for the study. Phase 1 of the intervention study employed a pretest&#8211;posttest design. In this phase, students learned about chemical bonding and structure and their effects on the properties and behaviours of different materials. They also learned about the multiple representations used to understand and communicate about chemical bonding and structure. Within a modified crossover design, Phase 2 of the study employed mixed methods to compare the effects on learning outcomes when they created two different scientific texts: a digital poster and a laboratory report. Both text types required students to integrate multiple representations to report on their learning during laboratory investigations. These text types were chosen because they are commonly used by scientists to communicate their experimental findings. In Phase 1, students engaged in computer-based inquiries using both molecular modelling and simulation software to investigate phenomena such as intra- and inter-molecular bonding and their effects on properties, the differences between various types of bonds, the multiple representations used to describe and investigate bonding and structure, and to present their understanding to others. In Phase 2, students used a range of scaffolding resources to design and carry out two inquiries about the chemistry of biomaterials. In the first inquiry, students made and compared the properties of two different bioplastic films; in the second, students compared the relative fermentation rates of a range of carbohydrates. In both inquiries, students were required to report their findings and explain them on the submicro level using appropriate representations. Scaffolds included Science Writing Heuristics, which explicitly required students to consider which multiple representations would support their claims and explanations of data; digital resources for selecting, modifying, or creating representations; and genre templates. Pretest&#8211;posttest comparisons for both phases showed that the instructional approaches and resources used were effective for enhancing students&#8217; learning outcomes. In all comparisons, the posttest performances were significantly higher. In the first phase, several of the identified alternative or missing conceptions about chemical bonding were effectively addressed, and in both phases, students&#8217; conceptual understanding and their representational competencies were enhanced. The pretest&#8211;posttest comparisons for Phase 2 suggested that creating a diversified text &#8211; a digital poster &#8211; for explaining experimental results is at least as effective for enhancing understanding and representational competencies as creating a more traditional laboratory report. Other data were analysed to gain an insight into how or why the instructional strategies and resources used might have been effective. The student interviews revealed a number of advantages of using digital technologies, including promotion of higher order thinking, enhanced motivation and interest, the capacity of digital technologies to support and enhance visualisation, and the production of multiple representations in multiple modes. Students suggested that the digital resources allowed them to make links between macroscopic, molecular, and symbolic levels and to include a range of representations in their explanations. The evaluation questionnaire revealed similar trends. Analysis of the students&#8217; texts suggested that the approaches used in Phase 2 were effective in supporting students&#8217; content and rhetorical problem solving and the interactions between the two. Students utilised a range of representations, particularly structural diagrams, when making explanations of their macroscopic data on the submicro level. This study has implications for the instructional approaches used by chemistry teachers because it showed that integrating digital technologies into learning environments is effective when introducing students to the multiple representations used in chemistry and in the development of students&#8217; chemical literacies. It also contributes to writing-to-learn research by focusing on multimodal communication and the benefits of creating multimodal texts for presenting, organising, and explaining data, and for representing knowledge. Significant findings of the study relate to the importance of digital technologies in generating multimodal texts and representations for instruction, scaffolding, and in student-centred inquiry-based learning. Further research might focus on the use of such resources for addressing other commonly identified alternative conceptions, the creation of other multimodal text types, the use of other digital technologies or authoring tools, or on the development of teachers&#8217; technological pedagogical content knowledge, which is required for effective classroom implementation of these resources and strategies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">chemistry education</field><field name="subject">writing-to-learn</field><field name="subject">multimodality</field><field name="subject">multiple representations</field><field name="subject">representational competence</field><field name="subject">educational technology</field><field name="subject">chemical literacy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205719</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantifying Oxidative Stress and its Role in Mitochondrial Biogenesis</field><field name="creator">Natalie Strobel</field><field name="description">Oxidative and nitrosative stress are deleterious physiological processes caused by an imbalance between reactants such as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and antioxidants. Due to the links between oxidative and nitrosative stress and disease, there is much interest in accurately quantifying these in biological and physiological samples. There are numerous methods to quantify the in vivo oxidative and nitrosative damage to lipids, DNA and proteins however they are generally time-consuming, expensive and difficult. Furthermore, due to the complex nature of oxidative and nitrosative stress it would be appropriate to measure a number of different biomarkers, however this is rarely done. The first section of this thesis contains research aimed at developing a bioassay to simultaneously detect markers of oxidative and nitrosative stress. This includes; 1) a review of the studies investigating the ability of these biomarkers to predict the onset of disease, 2) a description of the attempts to develop the bioassay, 3) a study designed to test the sensitivity of the bioassay to detect changes in oxidative stress. Unfortunately, the attempts to develop the bioassay were not as successful as hoped and, in the interests of completing the PhD in the time allowed, the PhD changed focus to look at the effects of oxidant:antioxidant balance on mitochondrial biogenesis. The second section of the thesis contains a review of the literature on this topic and two original investigations. It is well documented that oxidative and nitrosative stress contributes to the progression of many diseases including; cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, kidney disease and cancer. To determine which biomarkers would have the greatest efficacy in the bioassay, a comprehensive review was undertaken. The aim of the review was to investigate studies which have measured oxidative and nitrosative biomarkers to determine whether they are independent predictors of cardiovascular events (Chapter two). From the review, fifty-one studies were identified with twenty-six of these measuring oxidised (Ox)-LDL, fifteen assessing myeloperoxidase (MPO), seven using lipid peroxidation measures and three quantifying protein oxidation in plasma/serum. The recommendation of the review was that all areas require further investigation, however, it was determined that Ox-LDL and MPO would be beneficial for inclusion in the bio-assay. Other biomarkers considered for the bio-assay were nitrotyrosine, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. Chapter three outlines method development used to measure the oxidative and nitrosative markers simultaneously. Recent technology allows multiple analytes to be detected simultaneously from the one sample. The Mulit-plex system is used to detect analytes that have been sandwiched between primary capture and secondary biotinylated detection antibodies. The secondary antibody attaches to streptavidin-phycoerythrin and is used by the Mulit-plex analyser to quantify the analyte. During development of the bio-assay, clumping of microspheres, high background, no detection of standard curve or samples, matrix effects, mislabeling of antibodies by manufacturers and lack of commercial available antibodies were obstacles that limited the success of this method. MPO was the only biomarker that was successful. Chapter four contains a study that investigated the sensitivity of the MPO mulitplex bio-assay. Nine highly trained cyclists underwent an extensive exercise protocol designed to induce dehydration by 4 % body mass, rehydration of 150 % fluid loss and a performance time-trial. Plasma samples were taken at five time points; baseline, post dehydration, post rehydration, pre time-trial and post time-trial and analysed using the mulitplex bio-assay. The results showed that there was a significant increase in MPO post dehydration and post time-trial compared with all other time points (P&lt;0.05), thereby demonstrating that the mulitplex bio-assay is sensitive to detect changes in exercise and appropriate rehydration reduces oxidative stress. The MPO mulitplex bio-assay requires further testing on patients with diseases to further validate its future applications. As mentioned above, due to time constraints it was decided to stop the attempts to create a multi-analyte bioassay and focus on another important area of cellular oxidative stress. Currently, there is much interest in the involvement of oxidant:antioxidant balance in mitochondrial biogenesis. The increase of mitochondrial content within the skeletal muscle, termed mitochondrial biogenesis, provides an increased capacity to generate ATP during exercise and is recognized as one of major cellular adaptations to exercise. Reactive oxygen species are produced during exercise and have been shown to induce mitochondrial biogenesis. One of the key instigators of mitochondrial biogenesis is peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator-1&#945; (PGC-1&#945;). PGC-1&#945; is central to the transcription of mitochondrial and nuclear encoded genes, which regulate downstream pathways such as oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation. Antioxidant supplementation is common among athletes and healthy individuals; however, antioxidant supplements suppress reactive oxygen species and could therefore could hinder mitochondrial biogenesis and the positive adaptations associated with exercise. To establish whether antioxidant supplementation reduced mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle, male Wistar rats were supplemented with &#945;-tocopherol and &#945;-lipoic acid for fourteen weeks (Chapter six). Animals were separated into four groups: 1) sedentary control diet, 2) sedentary antioxidant diet, 3) exercise control diet and 4) exercise antioxidant diet. The exercise animals were trained 5 days/week for 14 weeks. Consistent with increased mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant defences following training, there were significant increases in PGC-1&#945; mRNA and protein, COX IV and Cyt C protein abundance, citrate synthase activity, Nfe2l2 and SOD2 protein (P&lt;0.05). Antioxidant supplementation reduced PGC-1&#945; mRNA, PGC-1&#945; and COX IV protein, and citrate synthase enzyme activity (P&lt;0.05) in both sedentary and exercise-trained rats. In summary, antioxidants &#945;-tocopherol and &#61537;-lipoic acid supplementation suppresses beneficial adaptations in skeletal muscle such as markers of mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial proteins, regardless of training status. The reduction in mitochondrial biogenesis may affect exercise training adaptations and reduce the ability of healthy individuals to attain optimal exercise adaptations. The last investigation (Chapter seven) studied the effect of reduced glutathione, through diethyl maleate (DEM) administration, on upstream regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis, markers of mitochondrial biogenesis and downstream signalling. Glutathione is a key antioxidant that reduces the amount of hydrogen peroxide. Male Wistar rats were divided into six groups 1) sedentary control, 2) sedentary DEM, 3) post-exercise control, 4) post-exercise DEM, 5) exercise-recovery and 6) exercise-recovery DEM. After an exercise bout to fatigue, animals were euthanized directly after exercise (post-exercise) or four hours post exercise (exercise-recovery). Exercising animals given DEM had significantly (P&lt;0.05) decreased glutathione in skeletal muscle and had a significantly (P&lt;0.05) greater increase in PGC-1&#945; gene expression. There were also main interaction effects between exercise and DEM administration on SOD2 activity. Exercise altered the gene expression of GPx and the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. Glutathione depletion decreased GPX activity and oxidised glutathione levels. These novel findings represent important in vivo evidence of the involvement of glutathione and oxidant:antioxidant balance in mitochondrial biogenisis. Overall this thesis has provided 1) the first comprehensive review on the prognostic ability of oxidative stress biomarkers to predict the onset of cardiovascular disease, 2) detailed information to assist in the further development of a multi-analyte bioassay to quantify oxidative and nitrosative stress, 3) data indicating that the MPO Mulit-plex bioassay is sensitive to detect physiological perturbations to oxidative stress, 4) evidence that antioxidant supplementation suppresses mitochondrial biogenesis and 5) proof that glutathione is important in the regulation of exercise-induced mitochondrial biogenesis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biomarkers, exercise, mitochondrial biogenesis, vitamin E, &#945;-lipoic acid, glutathione depletion</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205828</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rev-erb beta Regulates the Expression of Genes Involved in Metabolism</field><field name="creator">Sathiya Ramakrishnan</field><field name="description">Nuclear hormone receptors (NRs) are ligand-dependent DNA binding proteins that translate nutritional and physiological signals into gene regulation. The significance of NRs in human health and disease is underscored by the availability of drugs that targets NRs for treating several diseases. In this context, a subgroup of NR family has been proposed to regulate metabolism in a cell/tissue specific manner. The Rev-erb subgroup of NRs consists of two isoforms Rev-erb and Rev-erb. These two receptors have been shown to regulate different aspects of human physiology such as metabolism, inflammation, and circadian rhythm. Many NRs are expressed in skeletal muscle, a major mass peripheral tissue that accounts for ~40% of the total body weight and energy expenditure. This lean tissue is a major site for lipid and glucose homeostasis. Skeletal muscle express and secrete cytokines which perform autocrine and paracrine function with other tissues such as adipose. Accordingly, skeletal muscle plays important role in blood lipid profile, insulin sensitivity and progression of diseases such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. In addition, many studies have shown that NRs in skeletal muscle regulate glucose, lipid and energy homeostasis. Therefore, understanding the function of NRs in skeletal muscle provides a platform for potential new therapeutic treatments for metabolic disease. Rev-erb is expressed in skeletal muscle; however the function of this receptor in skeletal muscle metabolism has not been examined. Nevertheless, considering the importance of Rev-erb subfamily in metabolism, circadian control and the role of skeletal muscle in lipid homeostasis, the function of Rev-erb in skeletal muscle metabolism needs to be further investigated. We tested the hypothesis that Rev-erb (directly and/or indirectly) regulated the genetic programs that control lipid homeostasis in skeletal muscle. Initially, we exogenously expressed a truncated version of Rev-erb without the ligand-binding domain (Rev-erb) in vitro (in the C2C12 skeletal muscle cell culture system); and in vivo (in mouse tibialis anterior muscle. Moreover, we also attenuated Rev-erb expression in skeletal muscle cells using siRNAs targeting N-terminus and hinge regions of Rev-erb. We performed candidate based expression profiling utilizing quantitative RT-PCR analysis on the Taqman Low Density Array (TLDA) platform to identify putative downstream primary and/or secondary targets of Rev-erb action in skeletal muscle cells in the context of metabolism and muscle growth. Exogenous expression of Rev-erb in skeletal muscle cells in vitro decreased the expression of several genes involved in fatty acid/lipid absorption (including Cd36, and Fabp3 and 4). Interestingly, the mRNA encoding the master lipogenic regulator, SREBP-1c was also increased after ectopic Rev-erb expression. Moreover, we observed significant induction in the mRNAs encoding interleukin-6 and IKB that are involved in the regulation of the inflammatory cascade. Finally, we also observed the marked repression of myostatin mRNA, an important protein implicated in negative regulation of muscle hypertrophy/hyperplasia and a positive regulator of body fat accumulation. In summary, our in vitro study suggested that Rev-erb regulates genes involved in metabolism, inflammation and muscle growth. Quantitative PCR analysis that utilised the Taqman Low Density Array (TLDA) platform revealed Rev-erb siRNA expression down-regulated (in a subtle but significant manner) several genes involved in lipid/glucose homeostasis and the TGF- signalling pathway. Interestingly, genes that are involved in the myostatin and TGF- signalling pathway such as Activin A receptor type 2a (ACVR2A), Smad specific E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (Smurf1), and TGF- receptor 2 (TGFBR2) were identified potential (direct and/or indirect) target of Rev-erb action in skeletal muscle cells. Moreover, genes such as Citrate Synthase (CS), V-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 2 (Akt2), Peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor- coactivator (PGC)-1 (PGC1) were also significantly modulated by Rev-erb in these analyses. The expression of two mRNAs encoding a) SREBP1c and b) IKB increased by ectopic Rev-erb expression was examined in more detail. These were selected because Rev-erb has been presumed to function as a transcriptional silencer. Secondly, we had demonstrated that in vivo expression of Rev-erb (after injection and electroporation of mouse tibialis anterior muscle) increased SREBP-1c expression, and Rev-erb siRNA studies suggested that this orphan NR was necessary for optimal SREBP-1c mRNA expression. Consequently, we tested the hypothesis that Rev-erb encodes the potential to function as a transcriptional activator in skeletal muscle. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether the SREBP1c and IKB promoters were trans-activated by co-transfected Rev-erb in skeletal muscle cells. We initially tested whether Rev-erb regulates the SREBP1c promoter. Transfection experiments showed Rev-erb expression trans-activated this promoter. This observation was in contrast to previous promoter studies showing that Rev-erb is a potent repressor of gene transcription. Therefore, we subsequently performed an experiment in which we simultaneously used the Rev-erb promoter (previously characterized to be repressed by Rev-erb) and SREBP1c promoter to examine the effect of Rev-erb expression. This experiment showed that Rev-erb repressed the activity of Rev-erb promoter, and in parallel trans-activated the SREBP1c promoter. Bioinformatics analysis identified two regions covering putative Rev-erb response elements RERE1 (-1342 to -1158) and RERE2 (-525 to -401) in the SREBP1c promoter. Chromatin immuno-precipitation assays demonstrated that Rev-erb is selectively recruited to RERE2 between nucleotide positions &#8211;525 to &#8211;401 in the promoter. Unidirectional deletion analysis of the SREBP1c promoter coupled with the analysis of mutants in the LXR response elements (of the SREBP-1c promoter) confirmed that Rev-erb mediated trans-activation of SREBP1c promoter does not function through LXR response elements. Interestingly, treatment of skeletal muscle cells with Hemin, a molecule recently proposed to function as a ligand for Rev-erbs, increased SREBP1c mRNA expression. In summary these data show that Rev-erb is a novel positive regulator of SREBP1c mRNA expression in skeletal muscle. We subsequently cloned the previously characterised human IKB promoter region spanning the potential ROR and Rev-erb binding site. Transfection experiments showed that in accordance to previously published observation, ROR trans-activated the IKB promoter. However, both Rev-erb and Rev-erb when co-transfected with the IKB promoter had minimal effects on the activity of this promoter. Studies have shown that Rev-erb functions as a competitor for ROR and block ROR mediated trans-activation of its target gene expression. Interestingly, our co-transfection experiments showed that both Rev-erb and Rev-erb blocks ROR-mediated trans-activation of IKB promoter. Together, this data suggests that Rev-erb-mediated regulation of IKB transcription in skeletal muscle cells could occur through indirect mechanisms. In conclusion, our studies have shown Rev-erb directly and indirectly regulates the expression of genes involved in metabolism, inflammation and muscle growth suggesting that Rev-erb in skeletal muscle has the potential to be exploited in a therapeutic manner.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nuclear receptors, Rev-erb beta, skeletal muscle, gene expression, metabolism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205945</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing Environmental Balance Sheet Accounts to Measure Sustainability</field><field name="creator">Evan Thomas</field><field name="description">Abstract The resilience, or sustainability, of an environmental system depends on key factors remaining within critical thresholds. Current approaches to assessing the condition and trend of environmental systems rely on expert knowledge of system performance and subjective interpretation. Computer simulation models of natural resource systems offer a way to integrate system properties, and ecological theory and relationships, with long-term climate and rainfall information to simulate system performance within a consistent framework. Financial accounting methods, such as balance sheets and ratio analysis, have been developed to assess overall businesses viability and offer a potential tool for assessing the sustainability of natural systems, providing key accounting principles and assumptions can be reasonably met. This thesis explores the integration of accounting and ecological theory in a balance sheet framework for sustainability accounting using non-financial terms with a view to contributing to the sustainable management of natural resources within dynamic systems. A generic approach to constructing environmental balance sheets was developed and tested at a range of scales (field to catchment). Sensitivity analysis of the models was used to determine key factors and critical thresholds relating to system resilience. These values were then used to construct the balance sheets. The current ratio was then used to identify if the system was being managed sustainably. A current ratio (assets/liabilities) greater than 1.0, derived from the balance sheet, was shown to denote more resilient, and hence sustainable, systems. Case studies used were wheat cropping in the Maranoa area of Queensland, Australia, and the Bonogin Valley in the Gold Coast, Queensland Australia The same approach to constructing balance sheets worked across all scales from farm to catchment. . The approach was then used to develop a sustainability assessment of the Coomera catchment of the Gold Coast to consider how natural resource management and urbanisation is affecting catchment resilience. A series of models was used to develop the accounts: a grazing systems model &#8211; SGS; a cropping systems model - APSIM-sugar; and an existing catchment hydrology and water quality model - EMSS. The approach demonstrated that sugarcane cropping systems within the catchment were not likely to be sustainable without significant input of nitrogen, but that the grazing systems were. Furthermore, the overall catchment was likely to be sustainable (2002). This finding is consistent with an independent field-based assessment of the catchment conducted by the Healthy Waterways Partnership of South East Queensland. The urban development anticipated in the catchment by 2020, did not appear to have a significant affect as measured by long-term trends in flow frequency and water quality. The use of ratio analysis provided a dimensionless variable that related to the resilience of a parcel of land or catchment. These values were able to be spatially integrated, using an area weighted median, to provide an overall estimate of resilience of land use for a farm or a catchment. However, it was considered simpler to model the catchment of interest as a whole rather than to combine ratios from a series of catchment sub-models. The availability of appropriate comprehensive systems models may prove a limitation for application to all land uses especially native bushland systems. However, the approach developed in this thesis provides a robust and consistent framework for exploring system resilience and sustainability in a way that can augment existing approaches to natural resource assessments of condition and trend.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">resilience, sustainability, balance sheets, environmental accounting, systems models, current ratio</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205954</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some Burning Questions</field><field name="creator">John Fraser</field><field name="description">Burn injuries represent a major cause of mortality and morbidity as well as a significant drain on limited resources, particularly in the developing world. Advances in resuscitation, critical care, protective ventilatory strategies, earlier complete debridement complemented by more aggressive treatment of burn wound sepsis have reduced the mortality of thermal injuries. There has also been a move to focus on education and prevention campaigns, which have borne fruit and resulted in some reduction in the incidence of burns in the paediatric population. Burn care, once a Cinderella specialty, has become a well focused multi-disciplinary specialty in its own right. Burn injury is dissimilar to many forms of trauma. In major burns, the initial trauma may be limited to the skin alone or skin and lungs, but all organ systems are rapidly involved as the physiological derangement becomes systemic. The burden of this multi-system insult is substantial. Globally, the World Health Organisation estimated that fire-associated burns alone directly resulted in over 320,000 deaths in 2002, and in the USA, approximately 1million children sustain burns each year. Australasian guidelines suggest that all adult burns with greater than 15% total body surface area (TBSA) and &gt;10% TBSA burn in children will require fluid resuscitation and possibly critical care support at some point in their hospitalisation. Mortality in these patients with severe burns follows a bimodal pattern of early and late deaths. Causes of early death comprise refractory shock, inability to obtain a safe airway or provide adequate oxygenation, co-existent trauma, non-survivable carboxyhaemoglobin poisoning, and decisions that injuries are non-compatible with recovery, leading to therapy withdrawal. With improved resuscitation strategies, 95% of patients survive the early resuscitation phase. Late deaths are secondary to sepsis normally associated with wound infection and multiple organ failure. The morbidity associated with burn injury continues well after the acute hospital admission, frequently for up to several years post burn injury, as is witnessed by prolonged rise in basal metabolic rate and worsening scar tissue1, 2. It has been calculated that in children approximately 60% of the cost of burn care occurs post wound closure; that is, dealing with the disabling and disfiguring contractures associated with hypertrophic scar3, 4. Hence, research and new modalities are being aimed at reducing cost of treatment and improving quality of life for survivors of burn injury. Thus, this PhD aims to reflect the multidisciplinary nature of modern day burn care, with the inclusion of seven published papers and one book chapter covering prevention and education relevant to paediatric burns, treatment and minimisation of wound infection , and scar minimisation, along with the first study into the relevance of fetal wound healing post burn injury.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">burns</field><field name="subject">smoke inhalation</field><field name="subject">scarless wound healing</field><field name="subject">amnion</field><field name="subject">ovine model</field><field name="subject">antimicrobial</field><field name="subject">silver</field><field name="subject">system inflammatory response syndrome</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205951</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Blooms of the toxic cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula in Moreton Bay: links to anthropogenic nutrients</field><field name="creator">Kathleen Ahern</field><field name="description">The increased proliferation of benthic marine cyanobacteria of the Lyngbya genus in many tropical and subtropical systems worldwide is a concern due to the detrimental impacts these blooms can have on ecosystems, local economies and public health. While increasing nutrient loads from anthropogenic sources/activities has been hypothesised as the main cause, evidence to support this is limited. This hypothesis was explored by investigating blooms of the toxic, benthic cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula in a sub-tropical shallow coastal embayment (Moreton Bay) in southeast Queensland, Australia&#8212;where blooms have increased in frequency and severity. More specifically, the thesis aimed to investigate the role of nutrients in the physiology and growth dynamics of L. majuscula in Moreton Bay through examination of three main research questions. Examination of the spatial and temporal variations in the growth and nutritional status of L. majuscula in Moreton Bay (Research Question 1) was investigated by tracking natural summer blooms in northeastern Moreton Bay (Deception Bay) over two successive years. Detailed field observations, extensive biomass and tissue nutrient sampling (every 10&#8211;14 days) and a three-dimensional model were used to map the change in areal extent, biomass and tissue nutrients over the course of the blooms. The results demonstrated the innate ability of L. majuscula to rapidly spread and generate massive amounts of biomass, with the peak biomass calculated at 5057 tww in the 2005&#8211;2006 and 10 213 tww in the 2006&#8211;2007 seasons. A sequence of phases showing differing appearance, biomass growth and tissue nutrient changes were identified and documented. The role of nutrients (individually and collectively) in the enhancement of L. majuscula growth (Research Question 2) was investigated using a combination of comprehensive laboratory experiments (filament growth, 14C-bicarbonate uptake rate and biomass increase) and in-situ field experiments. Addition of nutrients to the water column were shown to promote prolific L. majuscula growth in the laboratory; this was confirmed in field experiments at two locations in Moreton Bay&#8212;showing nutrients can be a major causal factor in bloom formation. Additions of phosphorus (macronutrient) and iron (required for photosynthesis and nitrogen-fixation) caused the greatest stimulation of L. majuscula in both laboratory and field experiments. The form of iron was shown to be important &#8212;organically complexed iron (FeEDTA) was substantially more effective in promoting L. majuscula growth under laboratory conditions than inorganic iron (FeCl3). This is important as FeEDTA mirrors the naturally occurring iron organic complexes (which increase the solubility of iron) in waters from the region. The effect of nitrogen additions was more complex&#8212;likely due to the capacity of L. majuscula to fix atmospheric nitrogen reducing reliance on an inorganic nitrogen source. In the high light conditions experienced in this study, L. majuscula appeared to acquire nitrogen: (i) directly from the dissolved inorganic nitrogen in the water column&#8212;evidenced by a positive response to the nitrogen treatments; and, (ii) through enhanced nitrogen-fixation rates when iron and/or phosphorus were added in the absence of nitrogen&#8212;inferred from a substantial increase in the total nitrogen content of the L. majuscula biomass (nitrogen-fixation was not measured directly). The main sources of naturally occurring nutrients likely to promote L. majuscula blooms in Moreton Bay (Research Question 3) were investigated using laboratory experiments, soil and water analyses, and GIS-based modelling. The potential for groundwater/surfacewater from different vegetation, soils, geology and landuses within the study area catchments to stimulate L. majuscula response (14C-bicarbonate uptake rate) was tested in laboratory bioassays. Areas with acid sulfate soils (ASS), Melaleuca vegetation, pine plantations and Casuarina on ASS all had waters that enhanced L. majuscula growth. To investigate causal agents, bioassay response data and water analyses were subject to multiple regression and correlation analysis; this confirmed the importance of iron, phosphorus and nitrogen to L. majuscula growth and the roles of low pH and dissolved organic carbon, the latter two appearing to influence the chemical state and enhance the solubility of nutrients to L. majuscula. This information was incorporated into a GIS-based model to identify areas of hazard which were most likely to supply/export nutrients to Moreton Bay. These hazard maps, with further local verification, will be used as planning and decision support tools to assist government and landuse managers to limit the mobilisation and transport of key nutrients to potential bloom sites. The results from this thesis demonstrate that a precautionary approach to limit phosphorus, iron, nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon to waterways is necessary; otherwise the magnitude of L. majuscula blooms is likely to increase in Moreton Bay as coastal development intensifies with the predicted population increase. The thesis findings provide strong support for the hypothesised link between nutrients and the increased proliferation of Lyngbya and other benthic cyanobacteria blooms and are likely to be applicable to other areas where environmental conditions are suitable for their growth.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">blooms</field><field name="subject">cyanobacterium</field><field name="subject">groundwater</field><field name="subject">iron</field><field name="subject">Lyngbya majuscula</field><field name="subject">nitrogen</field><field name="subject">nutrients</field><field name="subject">organics</field><field name="subject">phosphorus</field><field name="subject">runoff</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206003</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DNA methylation throughout the human colorectum: Person, Place and Pathology</field><field name="creator">Daniel Worthley</field><field name="description">There are two chief molecular pathways to sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC), the chromosomal instability (CIN) and the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) pathways. A third pathway, the pure microsatellite instability pathway, is important in inherited CRC specifically hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer. The CIN pathway is characterized by an adenomatous pathological precursor, aneuploidy and microsatellite stability. CIMP pathway cancers, however, are frequently proximal, develop from serrated rather than adenomatous polyps and are strongly associated with BRAF mutation. The CIMP pathway is driven primarily by epigenetic rather than genetic instability. These pathway-specific molecular traits are evident within the pathological precursors to these cancers and thus pathway divergence must occur at the beginning of carcinogenesis or even before. Although DNA methylation is recognized as a key mechanism in colorectal carcinogenesis, relatively little is known about its pattern, regulation and relevance in normal colorectal mucosa. This PhD thesis characterized the profile of DNA methylation in the normal human colorectum and explored its associations with luminal, environmental, dietary and pathological factors. The genes methylated in CRC are characterized as &#8220;type A&#8221; (Age-related) genes and &#8220;type C&#8221; (Cancer-specific) genes. Generally, &#8220;type A&#8221; genes are methylated in both normal and neoplastic tissue with the degree of methylation proportional to the age of the tissue. The methylation of &#8220;type C&#8221; genes, however, is more specific for neoplastic tissue. The primary study recruited 166 patients undergoing colonoscopy. At colonoscopy, mucosal biopsies were taken from the caecum, transverse colon, sigmoid colon and rectum. DNA methylation was analysed by MethyLight at &#8220;type A&#8221; (ESR1, GATA5, HIC1, HPP1, SFRP1) and &#8220;type C&#8221; methylation markers (MGMT, MLH1, CDKN2A, MINT2, MINT31, IGF2, CACNA1G, NEUROG1, SOCS1, RUNX3). LINE-1 methylation was quantified by pyrosequencing. The last 5 &#8220;type C&#8221; markers comprise a CIMP panel used to identify CIMP cancers. Mean &#8220;type A&#8221; and CIMP panel methylation Z-scores were calculated. The PMR for each of these CpG island loci was compared to patient age, gender, previous colorectal polyps, smoking history and the presence of concomitant pathology. Most &#8220;type A&#8221; genes demonstrated strong and direct correlations between methylation and patient age (e.g. ESR1, &#961;=0.66, p&lt;0.0001) and had greater methylation within the distal compared to the proximal colorectum (e.g. ESR1, p&lt;0.0001). On multivariate analysis, the mucosal &#8220;type A&#8221; methylation Z-score had a strong, independent, inverse association with the diagnosis of colorectal adenomas (OR=0.23, p&lt;0.001), the precursor to CIN cancers. The mean CIMP methylation Z-score in normal mucosa, however, was significantly and independently associated with advanced proximal serrated polyps (OR=5.1, p=0.009), the precursor to CIMP cancers. The luminal and epithelial associations with colorectal methylation were explored by a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. This experiment was undertaken to determine whether dietary supplementation could modulate epithelial DNA methylation. In addition, the study was designed to evaluate intra-individual reproducibility of the MethyLight technique. The study consisted of a 4 week cross-over trial of resistant starch and Bifidobacterium lactis either alone or as a combined synbiotic preparation, in 20 human volunteers. Rectal biopsies, faeces and serum were collected. Rectal mucosal endpoints included DNA methylation at the CpG island loci and LINE-1, epithelial proliferation (Ki67 immunohistochemistry) and crypt cellularity. Faecal short-chain fatty acid concentrations, pH, ammonia and microbiological profiles (by DGGE and sequencing) were examined. The synbiotic intervention fostered a significantly different faecal stream bacterial community than either the prebiotic or the probiotic interventions alone, but did not show any significant associations with the epithelial or luminal parameters. To explore possible associations between luminal and epithelial parameters and mucosal DNA methylation, the baseline indices were further analysed. There was a strong positive correlation between baseline epithelial proliferation and &#8220;type A&#8221; marker methylation (&#961; = 0.7, p = 0.0001). Thus, &#8220;type A&#8221; methylation may reflect the cellular age or mitotic burden of a tissue, which is a function of both time and cell turnover. There were consistent inverse trends evident between faecal short-chain fatty acid levels and rectal mucosal DNA methylation. This PhD project found that DNA methylation within the normal colorectal mucosa varied with patient age and region and was strongly associated with the development of pathway-specific pathology, suggesting that the background colorectal field may predict both the at-risk patients and at-risk pathways. Diet and the luminal environment more broadly may influence levels of DNA methylation in the colorectal mucosa and could help to explain regional patterns of colorectal DNA methylation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dna Methylation</field><field name="subject">epigenetics</field><field name="subject">Colorectal Cancer</field><field name="subject">Carcinogenesis</field><field name="subject">nutrigenomics</field><field name="subject">Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206002</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of an intervention to prevent back pain in nurses and nursing students</field><field name="creator">Anna Dawson</field><field name="description">Nurses report high rates of back pain with consequent disability, work absenteeism and attrition from the profession. In the current climate of an international nursing shortage, efficacious interventions to reduce the impact of back pain must be developed. It is uncertain what components a back pain preventive intervention should comprise. Appropriate and reliable means to assess back pain and disability in nurses is also undetermined. The first aim of this thesis was to undertake a mixed methods program of research to inform the development of an intervention to prevent back pain in nurses. The second aim of the thesis was to examine the psychometric and measurement properties of back pain and disability outcome instruments frequently applied in nursing samples. Epidemiological studies were undertaken to examine factors associated with back pain in nursing cohorts. In student nurses, a history of manual handling work was found to be significantly associated with neck and back pain outcomes. In a large population cohort study of nurses and midwives, pain characteristics (pain severity and radiation), pain-related cognitive and behavioural factors (kinesiophobia and passive pain coping), job characteristics (job classification and manual handling task frequency) as well as demographic interactions explained sick leave due to back pain. A systematic review was undertaken to determine the efficacy of interventions aiming to prevent back pain and back injury in nurses. Due to methodological heterogeneity, a qualitative synthesis of evidence was undertaken on the 16 studies that met inclusion criteria. The review identified moderate level evidence from multiple trials that manual handling training in isolation is not effective and multidimensional interventions are effective in preventing back pain and injury in nurses. Single trials provided moderate evidence that stress management programs do not prevent back pain and limited evidence that lumbar supports are effective in preventing back injury in nurses. There was conflicting evidence regarding the efficacy of exercise interventions and the provision of manual handling equipment and training. A qualitative description study was employed to explore the beliefs and perceptions of nursing stakeholders regarding risk factors for back pain and strategies to prevent back pain in nurses. Stakeholders identified individual, intrapersonal, organisational and environmental risk factors that were consistent with the social ecological view of health. They believed that interventions targeting the individual would be ineffective in the absence of workplace and other reforms. At the individual level, they recommended strategies that address physical, psychological and occupational preparedness for nursing work. In addition, they suggested ecological intervention strategies to induce change at the intrapersonal, organisational, community and policy levels. A mixed method synthesis of evidence was performed to develop an evidence-based and stakeholder-relevant intervention that aims to reduce the impact of back pain in nurses. The proposed intervention incorporates evidence-based multidimensional strategies that address individual and organisational level factors, and proposes ecological factors that may warrant inclusion once evidence of their causal association with back pain is established. Methodological studies examined the psychometric and measurement properties of key instruments used to assess back pain and disability in nursing populations. An extended version of the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire &#8211; that is frequently modified when applied in nursing cohorts - was developed and deemed to have acceptable test-retest reliability. The Oswestry Disability Index was found to have unacceptable measurement properties for application in nursing samples, and is therefore not recommended for future studies of back pain related disability in the nursing population. In summary, this program of research contributes novel insights that can meaningfully inform understanding of back pain prevention in nurses. Factors not previously assessed in nursing populations have been examined and shown to be significantly related to back pain outcomes. The strength of existing evidence for the prevention of back pain and injury in nurses has been established, and methodological advances regarding appropriate and reliable measurement of back pain and disability have been made. The views and perceptions of stakeholders from multiple levels and vantage points have been considered and integrated within the interpretation of evidence from multiple mixed method studies. In fact, stakeholders have played a crucial role in the identification of an appropriate theoretical framework &#8211; the social ecological paradigm - to conceptualise back pain causality in nurses and identify relevant solutions. A future research agenda of expanded scope is implicated to adequately address back pain prevention in nurses.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Back pain</field><field name="subject">disability</field><field name="subject">sick leave</field><field name="subject">nurses</field><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">intervention</field><field name="subject">prevention</field><field name="subject">reliability</field><field name="subject">qualitative</field><field name="subject">focus group</field><field name="subject">mixed methods</field><field name="subject">logistic regression</field><field name="subject">systematic review</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205979</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#8220;Only another mother would understand&#8221; Parents&#8217; experiences of feeding their children with complex medical conditions</field><field name="creator">Lyndal Franklin</field><field name="description">With advances in neonatal, medical and surgical care there are an increasing number of infants and young children surviving with medical conditions. Many of these children have associated complex feeding difficulties as a result of the disruption to early oral feeding experiences and periods of restricted or non-oral feeding. These children are at risk of developing long-term feeding difficulties associated with sub-optimal nutrition and poor appetite regulation, delays in mastering skills that lead to eating and mealtime independence, and disruptive mealtime behaviours. Managing the extraordinary demands associated with feeding and ensuring nutrition for these children can present significant challenges for parents as well as health care professionals involved in their care. Occupational therapists are often core members of multidisciplinary teams providing hospital-based services to these children and their families. Embracing an occupation-centred perspective, participation in feeding and mealtimes are considered important co-occupations for infants, children and their parents and carers that occur within the context of parenting and family life. Understanding these contextual influences and the occupational needs of parents are essential but have been understated in the occupational therapy literature and clinical practice. This thesis describes a qualitative study using a phenomenological perspective to explore the lived experiences of parents of children with complex medical and feeding difficulties. Parents from fourteen families participated in the study. Data collection involved in-depth interviews, family mealtime observations and demographic questionnaires. Key findings indicated that parents experienced a high degree of stress in their everyday lives as a result of their children&#8217;s feeding difficulties, especially in relation to tube-feeding. Mothers&#8217; self-image was devastated because they believed that it was their ultimate responsibility to feed and nourish their children. Differences in how parents identified with and fulfilled their parenting roles and responsibilities emerged, not just in relation to feeding but also for other childcare and domestic activities. Overwhelmingly, it was mothers who assumed the greater share of these parenting responsibilities, and in addition, expressed a sense of responsibility for preserving family unity and the need to get on with family life despite the chronic nature of their children&#8217;s problems. These findings contribute to our understanding of the occupational challenges for parents of these children, especially mothers who have a primary role in feeding, and the impact of feeding disruptions on the lives of their families. This knowledge will assist clinicians providing feeding interventions to be more sensitive and responsive to the needs of both parents and other family members. Recommendations for clinical practice are proposed.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influences on teaching: Perceptions and experiences of university teachers</field><field name="creator">Jiao, Xiaomin</field><field name="description">This study attempts to deal with the complexity of academic life and what influences teachers and teaching in university. The case for the research rests on the premise that the complexities of the nature of influences and how they are perceived, experienced and responded to were underestimated and under-represented in the majority of previous studies in this area. The primary goal of this research is to offer a more holistic understanding of the phenomena by investigating perceptions, experiences and responses of a sample of 22 university teachers in New Zealand in relation to influences on their teaching thoughts and practices. The inquiry began with the researcher&#8217;s reflection on his personal experiences of teaching and learning in higher education, including key influences on his thoughts about teaching and teaching practices. This prompted an interrogation of the literature, which revealed that while a range of influences had been identified in relation to university teaching at macro, meso, micro and personal levels, there were limitations in findings concerning teachers&#8217; inner experience of and response to these influences, which provided a sound rationale for the conduct of this study. The researcher remained open to various theoretical positions as evident in literature. The study design presents a raison d&#8217;&#234;tre for a phased theoretical assumption to an alternative perspective of understanding and theorising the phenomena. Two different theoretical lenses are adopted. Firstly, epistemological constructivism and theoretical interpretivism are advanced as a suitable philosophical framework for the prosecution of the study that offers a methodological rationale for a qualitative investigation; grounded theory and a case study approach are applied in interpretative analysis. Second, ontological realism and epistemological relativism are imported in gaining insights from the perspectives of personal and social identities, human agency and structure as embedded in the data. The data gathering involved semi-structured interview, stimulated recall, and document analysis. Some data were collected from the participants&#8217; publications, conference presentations, and masters or doctoral theses. The data highlight a complex array of influences perceived and experienced by teachers in relation to their teaching ideas and practices. It identifies the significance of personal life experiences, both historical and ongoing, that influence teachers. It also reveals the range of contextual or structural influences that interact with these personal influences to affect teachers&#8217; thoughts about education, conceptions of teaching, and approaches to teaching and classroom practice. For each participant, these influential factors obviously play out in both complex and idiosyncratic ways with one another to exercise various degrees of influence on teaching thoughts and action at different points in teachers&#8217; lives. Data demonstrate the significance of teachers&#8217; perceptions of personal agency and structural power as an important mediator of their internal conversations about influences and their actual responses to them. Although the focus of the study concerned the various sources of influences on individual teachers at different levels, how they interacted with each other and how teachers inwardly experienced and made responses, what emerged has wider implications for teaching and learning in higher education, teacher development initiatives, academic leaders and managers and for other university teachers. The study provides a more holistic way of looking at influences on university teaching and opens up new research possibilities. The inclusion perspective of social critical theory is seen as a potent means to add fresh insights into the dialectical nature of teachers&#8217; agential power and contextual influences, echoing an emerging trend in the research on influence in higher education.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">influence</field><field name="subject">perception</field><field name="subject">experience</field><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="subject">university</field><field name="subject">teacher</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/939</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Airway smooth muscle dynamics</field><field name="creator">IJpma, Gijs</field><field name="description">The current study aims to investigate the relative contributions of each of the processes that govern airway smooth muscle mechanical behaviour. Studies have shown that breathing dynamics have a substantial effect on airway constriction in healthy and diseased subjects, yet little is known about the dynamic response of the main instigator of airway constriction, Airway Smooth Muscle (ASM). In this work several models are developed to further the understanding of ASM dynamics, particularly the roles and interactions of the three dominant processes in the muscle: contractile dynamics, length adaptation and passive dynamics. Three individual models have been developed, each describing a distinct process or structure within the muscle. The first is a contractile model which describes the contractile process and the influence of external excitation on contractile behaviour. The second model incorporates the contractile model to describe length adaptation, which includes the reorganisation and polymerisation of contractile elements in response to length changes. The third model describes the passive behaviour of the muscle, which entails the mechanical behaviour of all non-contractile components and processes. As little data on the passive dynamics of the muscle was available in the literature, a number of experiments were conducted to investigate relaxed ASM dynamics. The experimental data and mathematical modelling showed that passive dynamics plays not only a dominant role in relaxed ASM, but contributes considerably to the dynamics of contracted muscle as well. A novel theory of sequential multiplication in passive ASM is proposed and implemented in a mathematical model. Experiments and literature validated the model simulations. Further integration of the models and improved force control modelling of length adaptation is proposed for future study. It is likely that the coupling of the models presented here with models describing other airway wall components will provide a more complete picture of airway dynamics, which will be invaluable for understanding respiratory disease.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Airway smooth muscle</field><field name="subject">Mathematical modelling</field><field name="subject">Biomedical engineering</field><field name="subject">Power law relaxation</field><field name="subject">Tissue rheology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/941</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">As the bamboo sings</field><field name="creator">Wong, Liu Shueng</field><field name="description">The research question considers the possibility that culture and identity impedes Chinese New Zealanders from writing fiction about their own culture, and considers a Chinese New Zealand history as interpreted from a Chinese perspective.

The creative work is a collection of ten stories linked thematically by an archaeological approach to character psychology, expression and action. Some of the stories also explore the influence of popular culture and cultural archetypes on the characters. Important contemporary influences in terms of both content and style have been the short stories, Wheat by Tracy Slaughter (2004), Walking to Laetoli by James George (2004) and Aquifier by Tim Winton (2004). The introduction of the exegesis outlines my interests in the modern &#8216;slice of life&#8217; story, in the conflict and tensions that occur between emotional and chronological time, and in Charles May&#8217;s assertion that short stories, through their use of metaphor, are a vehicle for exploring mythological perception. The theorists who most influenced my research and creative writing are then highlighted and their contribution to my understanding of narrative technique is discussed. Four main narrative techniques are emphasised, and illustrated with reference to particular stories from the collection. The techniques discussed are all related to the fundamental craft issue of show don&#8217;t tell. Finally the exegesis touches on the difficulty a writer has in being an objective reader of their own work.

In the last two decades, Internet and digital technologies have rapidly transformed the media and reshaped how news is gathered and disseminated, and re-defined audiences and their role in the media. Before the Internet, news dissemination was scheduled and periodic, for example the 6pm television bulletin or weekly newspaper. Today news is now global and published in 24/7 round the clock news cycles. At this time, there were clear demarcations between radio, television and newspapers, which were all separate entities. These demarcations have largely fallen away as all media have migrated online to publish on the same platform, using the same elements such as text, audio and video. Increasingly, television is migrating online to the degree that forecasts predict that online television will eclipse traditional TV as we now know it, just as much as online newspapers have eclipsed traditional newspapers. This debate is widely contested In pre-Internet days, the media had distinct demarcations between the media owners, news gatherers (and production people), like journalists, and the audience. These demarcations are blurring as audiences increasingly participate in the media resulting in the emergence of a new breed of journalists; the citizen journalist. This is the most popular term used to describe these new journalists. The dynamic nature of the online platform and functionalities like Web 2.0 made it possible for anyone to publish themselves online, on a blog, on social networking sites or to set up their own website, at very little or no cost. This has spurred a lot of creativity, and the wider public has created vast amounts of content such as video, audio and text and submitted or published them online. Consequently, content creation is no longer the preserve and domain of the media and journalists; the ubiquitous nature of the Internet and the availability of other enabling technologies: inexpensive digital technologies like video cameras, digital cameras and recorders means that anyone with access can now create content and disseminate it. Debates in many parts of the world have suggested that these abilities are catalysts that could spur the public into contributing news and video content of breaking news to the media and help keep the 24/7 round the clock news cycle current. After all, some online social networking sites have already demonstrated that citizens possess the skills to produce and publish video content. At a time when the media is facing financial pressure due to reduced advertising revenues, caused in part by the economic crisis and by the shift to the online platform, there are suggestions that citizens could help newsroom budgets by contributing material. It is against this background of rapid online migration by the media, and the emergence of this new breed of news gatherers, that this research on the Open Newsroom is set. The research topic is not new; a body of research about online migration of the media and the new news ecosystem exists in many other countries. In New Zealand however, this is still an emerging area of for research. This research monitored news bulletins on New Zealand&#8217;s two main television news channels, 3 News on TV3 and One News on Television New Zealand for 12 months from early 2008 to late 2009. The idea was to gauge and analyse the amount of content submitted by citizen journalists. The research also looked at a case study which illustrated the potential dangers of using news content submitted by citizen journalists. The research sought the professional opinions of a wide range of decision makers and influential people from the New Zealand media such as editors, journalists and publishers and those involved in the training of journalists in New Zealand. Using a Mini-DV video camera and a digital audio recorder, the researcher filmed and recorded interviewees and edited video clips of the interviews which were then published in the media gallery on the website www.theopennewsroom.com. The interviews sought to find out and discuss the online migration by the media, the new news ecosystem, the public&#8217;s participation in the media and the benefits and disadvantages of citizen journalism. To put the research into perspective, the website also carries some research articles and literature reviews on the media. The research findings from the interviews with New Zealand media professionals who participated in the study match trends happening in many countries. While most value the potential benefits of citizen journalists in the news process, some strongly expressed a great deal of skepticism and suspicion regarding news contribution from nontraditional journalism sources. In general, the research offered a series of insights into modern media rather than clear-cut answers</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">broadcasting and online migration</field><field name="subject">online media</field><field name="subject">citizen journalism</field><field name="subject">online television</field><field name="subject">IPTV</field><field name="subject">gatekeeping</field><field name="subject">news ecosystem</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/940</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Professional service relationships in chronic illness: the client's perspective</field><field name="creator">Mandlik, Milind Anil</field><field name="description">The relationship between professional service providers and their clients is of great importance to many service industries including educational, financial, consulting and healthcare services. The aim of this research enquiry is to identify, generate and describe a theoretical explanation of how a client engages in and manages their relationship with their health professional over a period of time. Fifteen participants living with chronic medical conditions were interviewed over a period of four months with data collected via unstructured in-depth interview sessions, and analysed using thematic analysis. The analysis reveals three major themes, nature of relationship, degree of control and service satisfaction. Of central concern is the longevity of the relationship between the healthcare client and his/her service provider. If the service provider is willing to share their authority and relinquish some of the control to the client, the client feels empowered. The client is then willing to provide information and effort to co-create effective service episodes. This sharing of authority enables the client to have better control on their service consumption. The sharing of authority also has an impact on the client&#8217;s propensity to remain engaged with their service provider. The findings of this study have implications for our knowledge and understanding of professional service delivery and how it differs from the delivery of consumer services. The study clearly indicates a shift in the role of a client as an empowered entity who wants to be part of, not just the service consumption, but service production as well. The key lessons from this study may inform other types of services including financial, educational and consulting services.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Professional services</field><field name="subject">Relationship marketing</field><field name="subject">Service quality</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/942</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comrades or competition? : union relations with Aboriginal workers in the South Australian and Northern Territory pastoral industries, 1878-1957</field><field name="creator">Elton, Judith</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to understand the historical factors that contributed to Aboriginal workers being included in pastoral industry unions as comrades, or treated as competitors with white unionists for jobs and income.

However, Aboriginal people would not be invited to run this service themselves, nor would it be used to 'maintain' Aboriginal cultural traditions. Rather, these new facilities would deliver programs that 'informed' Aboriginals about 'plans for their future advancement'. By 1985, the position had changed dramatically. The government was now funding 'Aboriginal-controlled' media organisations throughout the country 'to restore and rebuild' Aboriginal 'cultural identity'. It was also underwriting the launch of an Aboriginal-owned commercial satellite service covering a third of the Australian continent. In this thesis, I have attempted to understand the policies that led to this remarkable change in government thinking. In undertaking this work, I have not attempted to construct a 'resistant' Aboriginal 'voice', positioned against 'the media establishment' and the state to explain these transformations in Aboriginal policy. Although such a voice routinely appears in the literature on Aboriginal broadcasting, I argue that such an approach simply replicates the rhetoric surrounding the state's own policies of 'Aboriginal self-determination' and, more problematically, masks the complex operations of government itself. It also assumes the pre-discursive existence of a particular kind of Aboriginal agency, without considering the specific conditions that gave rise to it. In this study, I have sought to demonstrate how this agency was largely constituted through the policies of Aboriginal self-determination. I argue that under these policies, the state would no longer act on Aboriginals as it had in the past. Rather, Aboriginals would be invited to act on themselves in managing programs proffered by the state. Through these means, the Aboriginal 'self' became an indispensable element in the operations of the government. However, since the Aboriginal self would be expected to carry out the work of the state, it also became the object of intense governmental scrutiny. Here, I show how a multiplicity of governmental technologies emerged throughout the 1970's that served to regulate, channel and enhance Aboriginal subjectivity in accordance with a number of governmental ends. In undertaking this task, I have focused primarily on the development of the 'incorporated Aboriginal association'. I will argue that such bodies not only allowed Aboriginal people a degree of 'self-management', but also provided the state with an institutional framework through which it could constitute both a competent and verifiable Aboriginal agency. The Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association, CAAMA, was one of numerous bodies established under these governmental technologies. The development of this complex organisation will serve as the main case study in this thesis. In taking this analytical approach, I have adopted one of Michel Foucault's primary objectives which is to examine the ways in which the human subject is constituted through relations of power, and attempted to respond to the following set of queries Foucault poses: How was the subject established, at different moments and in different institutional contexts, as a possible, desirable, or even indispensable object of knowledge? How were the experiences that one may have of oneself and the knowledge that one forms of oneself organised according to certain schemes? How were these schemes defined, valorised, recommended, imposed?

High rate codes are necessary for applications which require high bandwidth efficiency, like high data rate communication systems and magnet recording systems. Convolutional (rate k/n) codes, used as component codes for turbo codes, are preferred for their regular trellis structure and the resulting ease in decoding. However, the branch complexity of the (primal) code trellis increases exponentially with k for k/(k+1) codes, making decoding on the code trellis quickly impractical with increasing code rate. 'Puncturing' is the method traditionally used for generating high rate codes, which keeps the decoding complexity nearly the same for a wide range of code rates, since the same ?mother? code decoder is used at the receiver, while only the puncturing and depuncturing pattern is altered for changes in code rate. However, 'puncturing' puts a constraint in the search for the best possible high rate code, thereby resulting in a performance penalty, particularly at high SNRs.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coding theory</field><field name="subject">Iterative decoders</field><field name="subject">Convolutional codes</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:37034</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A retrospective analysis of marketing strategy and innovation management in the Thai export manufacturing industry</field><field name="creator">Panich, Tanompong Best</field><field name="description">The objectives of this research project are threefold: (1) to identify the key marketing innovation factors which drive successful export marketing strategy in Thai manufacturing companies, (2) to test the proposed model 'The Full Model of Export Performance' on Thai export manufacturing companies, and (3) to suggest recommendations to Thai export manufacturing companies in order to improve their export performance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marketing</field><field name="subject">Management</field><field name="subject">Export manufacturing industry</field><field name="subject">Export trading companies</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:37039</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The causes and level of distribution channel conflict of China telecommunication industry</field><field name="creator">Lu, Jinghai</field><field name="description">The differences between Chinese distribution channels and western distribition channels are neglected.

The Sunrise Dam mine is the largest gold deposit in the Archean Laverton Tectonic Zone of the Eastern Goldfields Province, Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia. A number of previous studies have established the geology, geochemistry and geochronology, but the nature of the gold mineralogy and distribution has remained poorly characterized. Mineralogical studies have established a paragenetic sequence consisting of five hydrothermal stages (D1, D2, D3, D4a and D4b) which are generally in accord with the major deformation events at Sunrise Dam gold deposit. The D4a stage was the dominant episode of Au deposition, followed, in importance by the D4b stage, which is characterized by more diverse ore mineralogy including base metal sulfides, sulfosalts, and telluride minerals. Based on EPMA results, native gold in D4a stage has higher purity, with a small range of Ag variations (fineness 923 ~ 977, average 945), than that of the D4b stage (fineness 596 ~ 983, average 899), in which fineness values decrease systematically in accord with mineral paragenesis, reflecting that gold deposition was from a progressively compositionally evolving hydrothermal fluid with respect to Au/Ag ratios. The occurrences of As-rich pyrites are restricted to steeply-dipping ore bodies, which are most likely structurally connected at various level by channel ways through which As-rich (D4a) hydrothermal fluid migrating upward. There is a systematic variation in composition of the tetrahedrite-group minerals ranging from Sb to As end-members with highly variable Zn:Fe ratios, which correlates with the later paragenetic stages (D3, D4a, and D4b) and mineral associations. The composition of the tetrahedrite-group minerals is useful as a petrogenetic indicator of the evolution of the hydrothermal mineralizing systems with time. A total of thirteen telluride mineral species, including two unnamed phases, were identified in the D4 veins. Among them nagy&#225;gite, the complex Pb-Sb-Au tellurosulfide is most abundant. The deposit is the second occurrence of this mineral in the Yilgarn Craton. Compositionally, nagy&#225;gite from Sunrise Dam conforms to ideal stoichiometry, with negligible As content and Au/(Au+Te) ratio of 0.325. The diverse mineralogy of the post-D4 veinlets relative to the host veins is attributed to small-scale reaction fronts established along zones of replacement. The presence of Au-Ag tellurides in D4 veins and the character of their breakdown products have implications for the gold recovery as well as for the genetic interpretation of the deposit. During the D4b stage, Au-richer telluride and Au-richer native gold mineralization formed earlier than Ag-(Au)-telluride and Ag-richer gold mineralization. Values of f(Te2) and f(S2) for the early telluride assemblages were determined at 300&#176;C to be -10.7 to -7.8 (log fTe2) and 11.4 to -8.6( log fS2 ). The Au content of arsenian pyrite and arsenopyrite from four mineralizing stages (D1, D3, D4a and D4b) was measured using in-situ LA-ICP-MS. The average Au concentration is 44.5 ppm in pyrite (n = 224) with maximum value of 3,067 ppm, and 1,483 ppm in arsenopyrite (n = 35) with maximum value of 5,767 ppm, which are the highest concentrations reported for the Yilgarn Craton. The concentrations of invisible Au in arsenian pyrite at Sunrise Dam varies with mineralizing events, mineral paragenesis, and textural type. Gold is strongly enriched in D4a stage pyrite (average 80.8 ppm) and to a lesser extent in D4b pyrite (average 16.8 ppm). Pyrite from D1 (average 3.55 ppm) and D3 (average 2.96 ppm) show much lower levels of Au enrichment. The presence of metallic Au below the Au solubility limit in the Sunrise Dam pyrite is interpreted as evidence of an epigenetic origin for Au mineralization. Small-scale remobilization during dissolution-reprecipitation (D4a) and recrystallization (post-D4b) processes resulted in the Au enrichment and the upgrading of Au during successive hydrothermal events in the deposit. The speciation of Au at Sunrise Dam and the exceptional size of the deposit are the result of multiple fluid flow and multiple Au-precipitating mechanisms over a single plumbing system.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mineralogy and Crystallography</field><field name="subject">Ore Deposit Petrology</field><field name="subject">Gold mines and mining</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:36670</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating the impact of information and communications technology for development (ICT4D) project</field><field name="creator">Ashraf, Mohammad Mahfuz</field><field name="description">Research in the multi-disciplinary domain of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and Development indicates there is potential for ICT to contribute to a nation's socio-economic, socio-technical and socio-cultural development.

However, previous research always focus on measuring the e-learning readiness of commercial organisations and tertiary institutions, leaving a huge research gap on the use and readiness of e-learning in primary and secondary schools. This thesis developed a model for identifying e-learning readiness levels of teachers in Hong Kong schools, with the aim of creating a general model which could be transferred to other countries which are less developed than Hong Kong, yet which all share common Asian cultures. This was a multi-stage research project, incorporating model building and empirical testing of a model based on the existing academic literature, through questionnaire surveys to both in-service and pre-service teachers triangulated by series of in-depth interviews.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ICT</field><field name="subject">Readiness</field><field name="subject">e-Learning</field><field name="subject">Information and Communication Technology</field><field name="subject">Change Management</field><field name="subject">Organisational Planning and Management</field><field name="subject">Educational Policy, Administration and Management</field><field name="subject">Educational Technology and Media</field><field name="subject">Education Studies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Teacher Education: Primary</field><field name="subject">Teacher Education: Secondary</field><field name="subject">e-Learning</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:36669</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A systems approach to contractor prequalification</field><field name="creator">Baroudi, Bassam</field><field name="description">Contractor prequalification systems have been the cause for much debate within government, industry and research circles.

New products should be delivered into market as soon as possible. On the other hand, customers also require new products having good reliability. Laboratory life testing is the traditional way to examine the reliability of products. Sample products should be tested till failures, which usually involve tremendous cost and time. Obviously, the reliability testing process extends the duration of 'design-to-market'. Cutting down the testing process can reduce the producing cycle properly. Currently, the accelerated life test (ALT) has been widely used in many companies as an alternative method. Although ALT reduces the cost of reliability testing through applying more severe environmental conditions than the normal ones on products, it is no longer sufficient as it does not describe the process of products' failure explicitly and it is still highly dependent on physical testing. Consequently, prediction models need to be developed for better understanding of the products' reliability.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">contact surface wear</field><field name="subject">automotive industries</field><field name="subject">Finite Element Analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/50735</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:37515</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Marketing indicators and performance in the defense electronic industry</field><field name="creator">Ben Ari, Benni</field><field name="description">First, the research reported in this thesis investigated the complex interplay of dynamic factors that comprise the business environment of the defense electronics industry (DEI) as a way of understanding the tactical marketing process.

There is an imperative to explicitly focus on, and rigorously specify, the CSFs that impact on the implementation of BI systems. Consequently, this research seeks to bridge the gap that exists between academia and practitioners.

They are mostly distributed in winter rainfall dominated areas such as those at Middleback Field Centre (MFC) in South Australia. They can be used potentially as an indicator of rangeland condition by estimating grazing pressure (trampling). Two BSC based indicators for rangeland condition assessment are species composition and cover. While there is strong agreement that BSC composition is a good indicator, there is less agreement that BSC cover alone is a good indicator. Although BSC have been included in previous remotely-sensed studies, their spectral characteristics, and hence their contributions to remotely-sensed spectral signatures, are not well known. Data collection methods were refined for suitable method selection, stratification and site characterization, and morphological/ functional group classification. Cover data of BSC were collected using a 100 m line-intercept method on the stratified land units and statistical analyses were based on the cover variance analyses. Spectra of BSC groups were collected and characterized for different remote sensing indices. Five grazing gradient models based on collected spectra were developed for the evaluation of BSC effect on remotely-sensed data. Both existing and newly developed remote sensing indices were examined for BSC detection. Sampling for cover of BSC in the field showed that there is indeed a detectable change with distance from water, suggesting that BSC cover can be used as an indicator of rangeland condition, provided that appropriate stratification of the study sites is carried out prior to sampling, and spectral differences in morphological and functional groups are taken into account. Spectral analysis of BSC components showed that different classes of organisms in the crusts have different spectral characteristics, and in particular, that the (commonly-used) perpendicular vegetation index (PD54) is not suitable for detecting BSC. On the other hand, ground-level spectral modelling showed that the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Soil Stability Index (SSI) did show a distinguishable contribution from BSC. A procedure for detecting cover of BSC was developed for image taken during the period after an effective rain, in contrast to the normal practice of selecting images of dry surfaces for interpretation. The most suitable intervals appears to be 2-4 days after rain in late autumn, winter and early spring. Of the existing indices, the SSI is the best for estimating cover of BSC from Landsat images. However, eight new indices, specifically designed for detection of BSC were developed during the cource of this work. The best results were obtained for indices using using the middle-infrared bands. These results are promising for application to rangeland monitoring and suggest that BSC cover is an important indicator of rangeland condition if appropriate stratification, classification and data-collection methods are used. The effects of BSC cover on a remotely-sensed method are considerable, and thus they can not be neglected during image interpretation. There are different phenological patterns for BSC, annual and perennial elements, thus there is the possibility for the selection of imagery based on each phenological stage to detect these elements. Application of certain indices such as the PD54 may create mis-estimation of land covers. Although some of the existing and newly developed indices had significant results for BSC cover estimation, there is a requirement for a standalone remotely-sensed method to conclude the best index.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Landscape Ecology</field><field name="subject">Ecology and Evolution not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Image Processing</field><field name="subject">Simulation and Modelling</field><field name="subject">Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing</field><field name="subject">rangeland monitoring</field><field name="subject">biological soil crusts</field><field name="subject">indices</field><field name="subject">remotely sensed methods</field><field name="subject">Terrestrial Ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:37800</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Children's literacy development in the context of their preschool pedagogies in selected communities in India: a case study</field><field name="creator">Gokhale, Neelima</field><field name="description">This multiple case study investigated children's literacy development in the context of current pedagogical practices of their preschools in three selected communities in India.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Education Studies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">early literacy development</field><field name="subject">preschool education</field><field name="subject">social and cultural context</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:38134</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Craft as Escape: Women and the Domestic</field><field name="creator">Farrant, Lesa</field><field name="description">The focus of this thesis is an examination of domestic handicrafts and the significance of these to Australian women's lives. The topic focuses on how the making of simple and ordinary handicrafts provides women with an escape from the domestic demands of day to day life. This thesis incorporating a body of ceramic artefacts and written exegesis is the result of an exploration of comfort and safety found in handicrafts and clay. In addition, the concepts of repetition and extraordinary ordinariness have been investigated. Exploration of this topic has required an examination of handicraft techniques, prompting me to confront and consider my own domestic situation and consider my own approach to and relationship with clay. For the final series of artworks in response to the research I have drawn inspiration from historical women's handicrafts techniques and made reference to these within the ceramic artefacts presented. Research into the area of handicraft as escape has prompted exploration into works by artists not only in the field of ceramics but those working with other media and therefore enriching my response to the topic. My research has provoked me to translate and transform women's craft skills to create a framework for my own works in clay in addition to establishing a context for my work within the field of contemporary ceramics and more broadly within contemporary visual arts. Among the results of the project has been the development of a new approach to the medium of clay incorporating innovative techniques, as well as a greater conceptual framework within my own ceramics practice.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Visual Arts and Crafts not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Ceramics</field><field name="subject">women's craft</field><field name="subject">domestic handicrafts</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:39152</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Defining information: the site of struggle</field><field name="creator">Myburgh, Susan</field><field name="description">The contemporary information context is paradoxically antipathetic to the traditional information professions, and there are indications that, in order to survive, they will need to undergo radical transformation. This would require a re-conceptualisation of the "objects" of their knowledge domain, the entities and phenomena which comprise it, and the relationships between these entities (with particular reference to the concept of "information" itself). The term "information" is used in a multitude of contexts in the so called "Information Society", and this overuse has undermined the disciplinary and professional position of the information professions: the site of information work is contested. Furthermore, the changing context of the Information Society has challenged and diminished the essential task of the information professions: to deal with society's information problems and needs, as distinguished from the provision of information and communication technologies. In addition, access to information itself is contested as it is increasingly mediated by technology. The aim of this work is to develop a conceptual model by stabilising the defining concepts and constructs of information work, so that the social objectives and praxis of the field are elucidated and supported.

It motivates selective disclosure and supports self-determination. People have distinct and varied perceptions of their privacy which change over time and, in the context of information technologies, they maintain privacy by controlling information about themselves. If a person considers the type and amount of information known about them to be inappropriate then their privacy is at risk. Many innovative and advantageous approaches to maximizing data utility have emerged in recent years. However, in many cases the support of privacy is compromised and, consequently, diverse approaches to protecting privacy have been enacted by various governments and regulatory bodies. These legal and practical considerations motivate the development of a privacy-enhancing architecture for databases. Examination of the literature and related technologies confirms the research opportunity. Investigated via an exploratory research approach framed within the Software Engineering Research Methodology, the architecture is conceptualised, formalised and developed. Australia's National Privacy Principles (NPPs) contribute legal context and enable clarification of privacy requirements, which are based upon NPP 2: use and disclosure. The architecture is conceptualised as integrating legal privacy obligations with personal privacy preferences, leveraging them as constraints to regulate the use and disclosure of personal data. These constraints also facilitate an approach to tracking long-term changes in personal privacy preferences. The architecture is formalised through the design of use cases and rules expressed in predicate logic. It is further developed through the consideration of rules and the restrictions imposed by the implementation tools. PostgreSQL is used to implement the proof-of-concept prototype and testing is conducted. Finally, advantages and limitations are identified and discussed prior to the suggestion of options for further research. The architecture contributes proof-of-concept that widely-differing, changing privacy perceptions and legal requirements can be integrated in the design of a privacy-enhancing database architecture. It enables compliance with NPP 2, provides for the competing interests of data utility and privacy, and extends to secondary data processing.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:39030</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ego Depletion: an investigation of effects on primary school students</field><field name="creator">Price, Deborah</field><field name="description">The thesis investigated the notion of ego depletion in children, on classroom-based, 'academic' type tasks.

Existing methods schedule track maintenance once the best train timetable has been determined and allow little or no adjustments to the timetable. This approach almost certainly produces suboptimal integrated solutions since the track maintenance schedule is developed with the imposition of the previously constructed train timetable. The research in this thesis considers operationally feasible methods to produce integrated train timetables and track maintenance schedules so that, when evaluated according to key performance criteria, the overall schedule is the best possible. This research was carried out as part of the Cooperative Research Centre for Railway Engineering and Technologies. We developed a method that uses a local search meta-heuristic called 'problem space search'. A fast dispatch heuristic repeatedly selects and moves a track possessor (train or maintenance task) through the network; this results in a single integrated schedule. This technique generates a collection of alternative feasible schedules by applying the dispatch heuristic to different sets of randomly perturbed data. The quality of the schedules is then evaluated. Thousands of feasible solutions can be found within minutes. We also formulated an integer programming model that selects a path for each train and maintenance task from a set of alternatives. If all possible paths are considered, then the best schedule found is guaranteed to be optimal. To reduce the size of the model, we explored a reduction technique called 'branch and price'. The method works on small example problems where paths are selected from a predetermined set, but the computation time and memory requirements mean that the method is not suitable for realistic problems. The main advantages of the problem space search method are generality and speed. We are able to model the operations of a variety of rail networks due to the representation of the problem. The generated schedules can be ranked with a user-defined objective measure. The speed at which we produce a range of feasible integrated schedules allows the method to be used in an operational setting, both to create schedules and to test different scenarios. A comparison with simulated current practice on a range of test data sets reveals improvements in total delay of up to 22%.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Operations Research</field><field name="subject">Heuristics</field><field name="subject">Integer programming</field><field name="subject">Train timetabling</field><field name="subject">Railway track maintenance scheduling</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/50708</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:37507</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Church and school as community: an ecclesiological study of the relationship between the Adelaide Catholic Archdiocese and its secondary schools</field><field name="creator">Battams, Craig</field><field name="description">This thesis is an applied ecclesiological study of the relationship between the Adelaide Catholic Church and its secondary schools. The specific focus is on the interplay between theological confession and historical reality. The theological confession with which I have been concerned is the understanding that the church is a community. The Archdiocese of Adelaide has been described as a community of people called into mission in and for the world. Catholic schools have also been regularly described as communities that exist within the wider church community. This study has examined how and to what extent this theological confession has informed and been informed by the contemporary historical reality of Adelaide's Catholic secondary schools and their relationship with the local church.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">South Australia</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Catholic schools</field><field name="subject">Catholic Church</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/58168</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:38672</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Primary health care: knowledge development and application in Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Davy, Carol</field><field name="description">Research into the use of information by health care professionals has generally been conducted in countries dominated by the biomedical model. In these contexts, illness is considered to have a scientifically identifiable physical cause, and treatment practices within the formal health care sector are prescribed and managed in accordance with this definition. Yet there are also contexts where other belief systems inform and guide the way that people think about their health. In comparison to the biomedical model, these contexts have contributed very little to our understanding of how health professionals develop their knowledge. This research investigates how primary health care workers (PHCWs) in one such context, Papua New Guinea (PNG), develop their knowledge about the health services they provide. In order to discover and understand the differing views of these PHCWs, 69 semi-structured interviews were conducted in three culturally and geographically diverse regions of PNG. In explaining the diagnostic and treatment practices they use, these participants provided insights into not only how PHCWs engage with information but also how it informs their professional practice. These data were analysed, interpreted and discussed using a framework consisting of four, primary but interconnecting aspects: the context in which information was provided, the interactions with the sources of information, the processes by which information was understood, and the outcomes realized as a result of the information being used. Findings indicated that the majority of participants in this study acknowledged, if not incorporated, information pertaining to biomedicine, Christianity and Indigenous belief systems into their diagnostic and treatment practices. Even when these belief systems clearly contradicted each other, PHCWs did not in general feel the need to make a conscious choice between them. From their comments it would appear that four factors contributed to this ability to incorporate diverse and often conflicting ideas into the way that patients were cared for. First, all of the belief systems were considered legitimate by at least one group of people connected to the community in which the PHCW worked. Second, although varying in degrees of availability and accessibility, members of these groups were able to disseminate information pertaining to the belief system they supported. Third, the PHCW had no particular affiliation with any one of these groups but instead regularly interacted with a range of different people. Lastly, the PHCW worked in situations where health practices were not generally well supervised by their employers and therefore they were relatively free to choose between various diagnostic and treatment practices. The qualitative interpretive approach adopted in this thesis contributes to the field of human information behavior by affirming that conflict is in the eye of the beholder. When a number of belief systems coexist and all are considered legitimate, information about them is freely available, and the recipients actions are neither constrained by their own dogma, nor imposed upon by others, individuals may quite comfortably embrace diverse beliefs. These findings may also contribute to a better understanding of health management practices in developing countries by suggesting that health professionals are not merely personifications of a biomedical model. Instead, the study demonstrates that multiple belief systems can be combined by PHCWs, and that in turn this benefits the formal health care sector through increased treatment options that are both appropriate and effective in such circumstances.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Primary Health Care</field><field name="subject">Health and Community Services</field><field name="subject">Studies in Human Society not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Sociology not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Indigenous Health</field><field name="subject">Development</field><field name="subject">Belief Systems</field><field name="subject">Papua New Guinea</field><field name="subject">Primary Health Care</field><field name="subject">Health Management</field><field name="subject">Information Behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:38312</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Total quality management for small and medium sized enterprises in Thailand : critical success factors and implementation framework</field><field name="creator">Akkarasrisawad, Decha</field><field name="description">Portfolio includes: paper 1.

The study is designed as an ethnography. This incorporated a review of the literature and images found in published texts; interview and questionnaire data; anecdotal narratives and familiarity with the South Australian glass blowing community; and tacit knowledge of glass blowing practice, glass blowing skills and techniques.

It questions what it means to live and die, yet provides no clear-cut answers about death or dying, life or living. This thesis explores some of the ways suicide has been understood and represented, to demonstrate that knowing suicide is dependent not only on what suicide means, but also on how meanings of suicide become part of knowledge. Knowing suicide is not a matter of responding to it as self-evident, transparent, neutral and obvious, but rather is implicated in social processes and norms central to how knowledge gains intelligibility. Guided by poststructuralist, postmodernist, feminist and postfeminist philosophies, the thesis takes up gender and gendering as its central focus, to interrogate how knowledge about suicide becomes knowledge. Critically examining a wide variety of textual sources, it argues that suicide is principally rendered as a masculine, and even a masculinist, practice. Knowing suicide today is anchored in suicidology - the study of suicide - and maintained by institutional sites of practice including sociology, law, medicine, psy-knowledge and newsprint media, each of which is analysed here. Suicide as masculine and masculinist practice is invoked through multiple, often-contradictory and inextricably linked readings of gender, even while claiming homogeneity. Its gendered foundations can however be made to appear gender-neutral, even when actually gender-saturated. The twin gender movements of neutrality and repleteness are in fact crucial to the knowing of suicide. The thesis establishes that knowing suicide can never occur outside discourse. Even more importantly, how suicide enters discourse cannot be thought outside gender. The body matters to the production of deeply problematic understandings of agency, intent and violence, on which the production of suicide as masculine and masculinist depends. It becomes clear that such dependence rests not only on gender, but also on race and sexuality, as conditions of its knowing. The thesis suggests that further attention be given to the production and maintenance of highly reductive and limiting homogenous truth claims in suicide - truth claims that validate and privilege some interpretations of suicide, at the expense of rendering others less legitimate and serious. If the processes and practices of interpreting suicide become a site of permanent debate, they are more likely to challenge the ways in which masculinist ways of knowing render, and limit, the intelligibility of suicide.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gendering</field><field name="subject">suicidology</field><field name="subject">knowledge</field><field name="subject">Indigenous Health</field><field name="subject">Social Theory</field><field name="subject">History and Philosophy of Medicine</field><field name="subject">Gender Specific Studies</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Studies</field><field name="subject">Communication and Media Studies</field><field name="subject">Culture, Gender, Sexuality</field><field name="subject">Cultural Theory</field><field name="subject">Epistemology</field><field name="subject">Social Philosophy</field><field name="subject">Philosophy not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Mental Health</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">suicide</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/48839</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:35965</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Speaking from experience: the work of consumer and carer advocates in educating mental health professionals</field><field name="creator">Loughhead, Mark</field><field name="description">This ethnographic study explores the teaching role of activists and community advocates who have become involved in the education and preparation of mental health professionals. Placed in the transcultural mental health context, the study aims to identify central features of the ?teaching role? of consumer and carer advocates as they have become employed via participatory strategies and employment scenarios within mainstream teaching programs and transcultural mental health centres. The central theme of the study is how consumer and carer advocates teach via the notion of lived experience, a key expression of recent workforce development policy in Australian mental health. The research outcomes from this focus indicate that the teaching work of advocates in contributing authoritative knowledge of self and others is influenced by many factors intrinsic to their performed representative role, rather than exclusively by their personal experience as a consumer or carer, as the policy of lived experience would suggest. I argue that the requirements of teaching as defined by the expectations of employing organisations and the clinical audience, and by traditions in representative advocacy and professional education all shape the way in which advocates build and express their knowledge in educational work.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">consumer</field><field name="subject">Psychiatry</field><field name="subject">Mental Health Nursing</field><field name="subject">Mental Health</field><field name="subject">Primary Health Care</field><field name="subject">multiculturalism</field><field name="subject">ethnography</field><field name="subject">mental health</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/48858</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:35972</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Retrofitting of angle legs of transmission towers to increase load capacity</field><field name="creator">Tongkasame, Chirawat</field><field name="description">The ability of a retrofitting method that bolted additional angle members in parallel to existing transmission tower legs to increase their load capacity was examined, using both experimental work and complex finite element modelling.

Computers, notebooks, networks, mobile phones, digital cameras and embedded devices are all readily available and it is difficult to imagine a person that does not own at least some of these. However, with this rise in the use of electronics, comes its potential misuse. Electronic devices have transformed how existing crimes may occur, and also have allowed for several new forms of illegal activity. However, given the global nature of the Internet, such crimes may take place over multiple jurisdictions and countries. Where the investigation into computer-based crime occurs between two or more countries, there is a need for the two teams to understand the legal and cultural differences between them. Whilst the legal differences are written, interpreted and can be made explicit, there is less knowledge on the cultural differences between two countries, working in an emerging scientific field. Literature not only shows that the applications of science are affected by culture, but also demonstrates that computer forensics is a subject within the field of science. This research seeks to answer the question: Does Culture have impacts on Applications of Computer Forensics? In order to seek the answer of this problem, at least two countries with different cultural backgrounds and customs will be examined. Specifically, this work will discuss Australia and Taiwan, as these countries are examples of distinctive cultural variations found in the Asia Pacific. Culture is difficult to directly measure, and this work utilises the Delphi survey technique and case study interviews of computer forensic professionals and experts in the field in both Australia and Taiwan as its primary source of data collection. Analysis of this data provides both a view of the field at large, provided by the Delphi survey results and more detailed knowledge from specific experts gathered from the interviews. Specifically, the Delphi survey has 40 questions in five dimensions (Current Situation, Policy and Organization, Education, Law, and Personal Preference and Skill), and the interview is comprised of 13 questions, each asking for more depth than the Delphi can provide. The outcomes of this research directly compare the Australian and Taiwanese cultures as they apply to the field of computer forensics. As such, the most tangible outcome is a framework for Australian and Taiwanese law enforcement, forensic science community, and the court. The suggestions for cross-cultural, cross-border and collaborative digital forensic investigations can be provided based on the discoveries of this research. This thesis essentially helps the mutual understanding between Australian and Taiwanese computer forensic investigators. The understanding is able to improve the chances of success of future cooperation between Australia and Taiwan.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer forensics, culture</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/48864</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:35973</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reinforcement learning and convergence analysis with applications to agent-based systems</field><field name="creator">Leng, Jinsong</field><field name="description">Agent-based systems usually operate in real-time, stochastic and dynamic environments. Many theoretical and applied techniques have been applied to the investigation of agent architecture with respect to communication, cooperation, and learning, in order to provide a framework for implementing artificial intelligence and computing techniques. Intelligent agents are required to be able to adapt and learn in uncertain environments via communication and collaboration (in both competitive and cooperative situations). The ability of reasoning and learning is one fundamental feature for intelligent agents. Due to the inherent complexity, however, it is difficult to verify the properties of the complex and dynamic environments a priori. Since analytic techniques are inadequate for solving these problems, reinforcement learning (RL) has appeared as a popular approach by mapping states to actions, so as to maximise the long-term rewards. Computer simulation is needed to replicate an experiment for testing and verifying the efficiency of simulation-based optimisation techniques. In doing so, a simulation testbed called robot soccer is used to test the learning algorithms in the specified scenarios. This research involves the investigation of simulation-based optimisation techniques in agent-based systems. Firstly, a hybrid agent teaming framework is presented for investigating agent team architecture, learning abilities, and other specific behaviors. Secondly, the novel reinforcement learning algorithms to verify goal-oriented agents; competitive and cooperative learning abilities for decision-making are developed. In addition, the function approximation technique known as tile coding (TC), is used to avoid the state space growing exponentially with the curse of dimensionality. Thirdly, the underlying mechanism of eligibility traces is analysed in terms of on-policy algorithm and off-policy algorithm, accumulating traces and replacing traces. Fourthly, the "design of experiment" techniques, such as Simulated Annealing method and Response Surface methodology, are integrated with reinforcement learning techniques to enhance the performance. Fifthly, a methodology is proposed to find the optimal parameter values to improve convergence and efficiency of the learning algorithms. Finally, this thesis provides a serious full-fledged numerical analysis on the efficiency of various RL techniques.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Robocup Soccer</field><field name="subject">Reinforcement Learning</field><field name="subject">Convergence Analysis</field><field name="subject">Approximation Theory</field><field name="subject">Numerical Analysis</field><field name="subject">Optimisation</field><field name="subject">Systems Theory and Control</field><field name="subject">Expert Systems</field><field name="subject">Intelligent Robotics</field><field name="subject">Simulation and Modelling</field><field name="subject">Agent Architecture</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/48866</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:35974</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond the deferential worker: gendered, classed and rural meanings of work for production workers in a large wine producing organisation</field><field name="creator">Hoon, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">My central concern in this thesis is to extend understandings of how the social categories of rurality, gender and class are implicated in subjective meanings and the claiming of worth (associated with paid work) for a group of rural-based wine production workers. However, this concern does not reflect a relativist stance whereby all gendered, classed and rural experiences are read as equal but different, as this would deny symbolic and material inequalities. The core research question is: What gendered classed and rural subjective meanings do women and men production workers in the wine industry give their working selves? A key impetus for this study was my desire to represent working people's lives through a dynamic model of class, gender and rurality that overcomes the limitations of analyses which portray the lives of people, who have limited access to dominant symbolic discourses and processes, solely through the lens of deficit models of class and gender (Savage 2000, 2005; Skeggs 2004a). The overall methodological approach stressed the 'qualitative'. A feminist interpretation of constructivist grounded theory methodology framed the research (Charmaz 2000). Data generation involved two in-depth, face-to-face interviews with a sample of 16 workers (8 women and 8 men) based within the production function of a rural-based corporate wine organisation in South Australia. In the first interview I used a life history orientated approach and in the second I used a semi-structured interview schedule to examine the workers' current working lives, reflecting an understanding that rather than merely having experiences, 'subjects are constituted through experience' (Skeggs 1997). Interpretative analysis (using NUDIST) of the data re-orientated my engagement with established analyses of rurality, gender and class in order to build new, empirically-driven understandings of how multiple social categories are implicated in lived experiences. Preliminary data analysis led me to engage with Bourdieu's (1984) key concept of economic, social and cultural capitals as an analytical tool to examine how rural, gendered and classed lived experiences gave meanings to these workers. I have also paid attention to Skeggs' (2004a) argument that contemporary 'class making' involves uneven value attribution, the conferring of use values on practices and goods, engagement with inscriptions of value (inscription of lack of value and contestation of this), and critique of 'undeserved' exchange-based capitals as well as unequal access to exchangeable capitals. Skeggs' theoretical contribution has been extended to gendered and rural processes to examine how workers claim worth (as a worker) through these as well as classed processes. An exploration of the workers' family and work-based trajectories (including family historical ties to the local wine region, educational experiences and working trajectories) demonstrates the multiple ways in which class, gender and rurality are involved in lived experiences. The data highlight the ongoing influences of accrual of capital values (both use and exchange) tied to family upbringing and working trajectories, while analysis of current meanings of work provides greater detail on how the workers engage with value attribution of capital values, claiming worth in their work through challenging 'undeserved' capital values of winemakers, managers and technical experts.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">qualitative</field><field name="subject">worth</field><field name="subject">use values</field><field name="subject">exchange values</field><field name="subject">Gender Specific Studies</field><field name="subject">Social Theory</field><field name="subject">class</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/48870</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:35976</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supported residential facilities: supporting residents to stay or move on?</field><field name="creator">Clark, Alice</field><field name="description">Many Supported Residential Facility (SRF) residents express a desire to live in more independent accommodation, however relatively few achieve this. Two of the issues preventing this are a lack of housing alternatives and support. This study examines the relevant literature and legislation, to gather documentary evidence and demographic data about South Australian SRFs and their residents. This is augmented by interviews with five key informants, to discover what other factors inhibit SRF residents from moving on to alternative accommodation. Findings indicate that recovery and rehabilitation are inhibited in SRFs and that current standards are barely sustaining people. Data suggests that legislation has a negative impact on residents and service delivery. This research recommends that the South Australian Government take up its legislative and ministerial responsibility to SRFs and their residents as a matter of urgency, especially in relation to fire safety. Secondly, that there is a review of The Legislation to incorporate citizenship rights and individualised care. And lastly, that in the interim, funding tied to service agreements is made available to SRFs, so that they become a place to recover and not the end of the line.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human Rights</field><field name="subject">Social Policy</field><field name="subject">Social Policy and Planning</field><field name="subject">Public Policy</field><field name="subject">Care for Disabled</field><field name="subject">Residential Client Care</field><field name="subject">Housing</field><field name="subject">Disability</field><field name="subject">Mental Health</field><field name="subject">Citizenship</field><field name="subject">Supported Accommodation</field><field name="subject">Supported Residential Facility</field><field name="subject">Supported Residential Facility Act</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/48833</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:35963</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Horizontal and vertical integration of object oriented information systems behaviour</field><field name="creator">Grossmann, Georg</field><field name="description">Integration is one of the driving themes in database and applied computing research. Starting with the development of Federated Information Systems and passing over to Enterprise Application Integration, the integration of distributed systems receives a lot of attention with the development of Web services these days. Integration on an architecture independent level can be cast to the integration of autonomous object oriented systems which requires the integration of object structure and object behaviour. Past research has mainly addressed the structural aspects meaning the integration of class attributes and relations. This thesis is addressing the integration of object behaviour and proposes a structured, model-driven approach for the integration of business processes specifying software application behaviour. It consists of the identification of correspondences between business processes on different levels of abstraction and associates the correspondences with integration patterns that lead to a specific technical integration. One advantage of the approach is that correspondences and patterns are defined separately, which enhances the re-usability of patterns in different integration scenarios. Integration scenarios can be distinguished between horizontal and vertical integration, and within or across enterprise borders. Within an enterprise, horizontal integration consists of integrating systems on the same level of abstraction and vertical integration consists of integrating systems on different levels of abstractions, whereas across enterprise borders, horizontal integration consists of determining the most appropriate systems, from among a set of functionally equivalent ones, and vertical integration consists of defining an appropriate combination of systems to create a new one. So far, there exist no approach that attempts to support all integration scenarios within a framework. This thesis proposes an integration approach that is able to support all integration scenarios mentioned before. The approach is built on a meta-meta layer architecture and provides generic methods and techniques for the logical integration of object behaviour based on a domain independent framework. The thesis proposes two alternative outcomes of an integration. First one creates a new global behaviour that integrates local behaviour and can be supported by a service oriented architecture. Second alternative outcome are synchronisation points between business process, so-called inter-process dependencies, that can be supported by an event-driven architecture. The advantages and disadvantages of both are discussed in detail.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Meta modelling</field><field name="subject">Interorganisational Information Systems</field><field name="subject">Conceptual Modelling</field><field name="subject">Information Systems Development Methodologies</field><field name="subject">Behaviour-based integration</field><field name="subject">Business processes</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/48836</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:35964</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Bit of Give and Take: Older Volunteers' Sources of Value and Worth</field><field name="creator">Adams, Jennifer</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of older volunteers and their feelings of being valued and of worth within that role. The perceptions of older volunteers and their managers within three participating non-government organisations, government and organisational policy documents and relevant legislation and literature in the fields of ageing and volunteering provided data for the research. Changing political, economic and social conditions together with ageing of the Australian population have resulted in human services being increasingly contracted to non-government organisations. This in turn has resulted in more services than hitherto being delivered by volunteers many of whom are older people. Population ageing implies that there will be an increasing need for human services provision in the first half of the twenty first century. Whether there will be sufficient volunteers to maintain these services will depend at least in part on the responsiveness of organisations to their volunteer base and the effectiveness of their recruitment strategies. This research indicates that a sense of mastery over their circumstances is critical to volunteer satisfaction. Volunteers discussed their perceptions of maintaining control over their circumstances through the process of initiating volunteering arrangements and negotiating role changes in response to their changing health or abilities. Managers recognised the need to be responsive to the changing abilities of older volunteers and identified strategies for maintaining the volunteer contribution. Management style and in particular communication emerged as integral to volunteer satisfaction and an awareness of and responsiveness to differing motivators was important, particularly in relation to social networking and making a worthwhile contribution as a source of feeling valued.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">volunteering</field><field name="subject">self-esteem</field><field name="subject">Ship and Platform Hydrodynamics</field><field name="subject">Social Policy and Planning</field><field name="subject">Social Work not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Social and Cultural Anthropology</field><field name="subject">aging</field><field name="subject">ageing</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/48830</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:35962</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of perspective taking on anger experience and expression</field><field name="creator">Gerace, Adam</field><field name="description">The way in which we perceive and interpret the causes of situations is likely to have a profound influence on our subsequent behaviour. It has been well established that the experience of anger is likely to systematically influence the cognitive processing style and cognitive skills that the individual will use in understanding, and responding to, interpersonal situations. One important process that may be affected by the regular experience of intense anger (trait anger), is the dispositional propensity to attempt to understand the thoughts, feelings, and point of view of another person in an interpersonal interaction (i.e., perspective taking). A study was conducted to test this theoretical hypothesis. In addition, the study attempted to examine the influence of perspective taking on anger experience, control, and expression.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mental Health</field><field name="subject">Medical and Health Sciences not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Personality, Abilities and Assessment</field><field name="subject">Social and Community Psychology</field><field name="subject">Anger</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/48665</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:35839</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The place of physical planning solutions in the urban redevelopment process</field><field name="creator">Findlay, Michael</field><field name="description">This thesis presents evidence to support the main contention that the urban redevelopment process is limited in its ability to deliver better communities and that it needs to be seen as only part of a broader community-building process.

Moreover, recent research suggests that the detrimental effects of sleep loss are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the effects of alcohol intoxication. Despite this, sleepiness-related performance impairment has not been subject to the strict levels of regulatory intervention that govern alcohol consumption when driving and/or at work. It has been proposed that this failure to address the occupational, health and safety impact of sleep loss, and the subsequent lack of legislation to manage and control sleepiness in a manner commensurate with the associated statistical risks, may in part, reflect a failure to provide policy makers with a readily understood index of the relative risk associated with sleep loss. Therefore the aim of the studies in this thesis was to assess and quantify the effects of sleep loss on a range of measures, including neurobehavioural performance, sleepiness, and daytime sleep quality and quantity.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sleep disorders</field><field name="subject">Sleep deprivation</field><field name="subject">Sleep apnea syndromes</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/48685</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:35847</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managerial characteristics and business strategy as determinants of business performance as moderated by business environment of Chinese SMEs in the State of Sarawak, East Malaysia</field><field name="creator">Sung, Ching Ing</field><field name="description">This exploratory study investigates the combined effects on firm performance of Chinese SMEs in Sarawak due to the managerial characteristics of owners / managers and business strategy as moderated by business environment.

Since most economic activities are under the control of Overseas Chinese, the study of the influence of Chinese Culture has become an important item in strategic management research. Despite the criticality of understanding the strategic decision processes of Chinese managers, very few empirical studies have addressed this gap. This research attempts to develop an integrative model that explains the causal relationships between Chinese culture, strategic decision making processes and organizational performance. The study uses the quantitative research design and structural equation analysis technique to develop and test the model. The major findings are two causal paths in the model, namely cognitive-speed path and social-political path. The cognitive-speed path suggests that the Chinese focus on the big picture and that the adoption of a holistic view, as well as drawing analogues from past experience and extensive network, will reduce the duration of the decision process. The social-political path shows that Chinese managers focus on the collective interest, strive to maintain harmony and save face; the managers also use a collaborative approach to handling conflict, thus reducing dysfunctional political behavior, while reinforcing the decision team's focus on common goals, factual data and fair processes. These two paths are found to have a positive relationship with organizational performance with the cognitive-speed path showing a stronger effect. The most significant contribution of this study is the establishment of a Chinese strategic decision making process model that can benefit both Western and Chinese organizations by adapting some of its implications. Future studies can enhance the model using longitudinal design with more detailed variables and larger sample size to study the effect of other contextual differences like ownership or age groups.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Management</field><field name="subject">Corporate culture</field><field name="subject">Business enterprises</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/49387</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:36423</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tragicomedy in the sociopolitical protest art of Yogyakarta</field><field name="creator">Wraith, Barrie Hamilton</field><field name="description">Sociopolitical artists in Yogyakarta have a long history of objection to governmental suppression in Indonesia.

In the years immediately following Suharto's forced resignation in 1998 artists more boldly showed criticism of both previous and present corruption, collusion and nepotism.
