The overall aim of the present study was to investigate the age related differences in the patterns of processing uncertainty within the theoretical construct of working memory, particularly the central executive, the episodic buffer, and the visuospatial sketchpad. The uncertainty associated with responding to stimuli is a complex construct that has received little attention in either the ageing literature or the working memory literature. The present study developed choice reaction time tasks based on the findings of Hick (1952) and Hyman (1953), in which the participant&#146;s choice reaction time to a stimulus was shown to depend on three main variables. These three variables were found to vary the uncertainty associated with responding to a stimulus. The first variable was the stimulus set size. The number of stimuli was operationalised by the number of locations, four or eight, from which stimuli could appear. The second variable was condition probability. The currently appearing stimulus could appear from any one of four or eight locations. The current stimulus appeared with a probability equal to the other stimuli appearing in the condition, or appeared with a probability that could be different to the probabilities of other stimuli appearing in the condition. Thus, the current stimulus could appear within an equiprobable or a nonequiprobable condition. The third variable was the probability of appearance of the current stimulus. In the present study the current stimulus probability was manipulated to be either 0.250 or 0.125. These variables were manipulated in order to investigate the effect of responding to uncertainty across the healthy adult lifespan. In general, increasing age increased choice reaction time in response to the current stimulus under all experimental conditions, and increasing choice number significantly increased choice reaction time for all age groups. The literature review in chapter 1 highlighted the difficulties in assessing age related response differences in tasks that measure executive processes. In this chapter it is suggested that the methodology used in choice reaction tasks, developed within the information processing and &#147;uncertainty&#148; paradigm, may provide an insight into how and what changes occur to executive processing over the healthy adult lifespan. The results in the present study were interpreted within the theoretical structure of Baddeley&#146;s (2000b) model of working memory. This gave an explanatory framework to the age related patterns of choice reaction time responses. The experiment in chapter 2 examined the second variable, condition probability. The differences in choice reaction time responses between an 8 choice equiprobable condition and an 8 choice nonequiprobable condition, and between a young and an old age group, were explored. There was a significantly faster choice reaction time in response to the 8 choice nonequiprobable condition for both age groups. However, there was a disproportionately faster choice reaction time response to the 8 choice nonequiprobable condition by the older age group. The results suggested that the uncertainty associated with responding to stimuli was not only dependent on the equiprobable or a nonequiprobable condition in which the current stimulus appears, but also vulnerable to the effects of age. The results suggested that an episodic buffer (Baddeley, 2000b) supplies a central executive with precise information concerning condition probability. The choice reaction time responses indicated that a calculated amount of information using the probabilities of appearance of the stimuli does not explain the total uncertainty associated with the stimulus. The experiments reported in chapter 3 used single response tasks and chapter 4 used dual response tasks. These experiments examined condition probability again, along with the first variable, effect of choice set size, and the third variable, the current stimulus probability. Healthy adult participants aged from late teens to eighties were included. The choice reaction time responses in nonequiprobable conditions, compared to equiprobable conditions, were faster in response to both stimuli probabilities. Responses to the stimulus probability of 0.125 in the nonequiprobable conditions in both single and dual tasks were always significantly faster compared to the stimulus probability of 0.250 for all age groups. The older age groups&#146; choice reaction times were disproportionately slower in response to the stimuli of probability 0.250, compared to 0.125. This suggested that the central executive retains priority in responding to stimuli with a low probability, 0.125, in older age groups. The disproportionate response by the older age groups to stimulus probability, compared to the younger age groups, also suggested that the episodic buffer may not be as affected by increasing age as other working memory components. This also suggested the information held in the episodic buffer affects the speed of processing. The choice reaction time response patterns to both stimulus probability and condition probability were the same in the dual task conditions, compared to the single task conditions, for all age groups. The experiment in chapter 5 addressed the issue that the choice reaction time results were based on a small number of stimulus presentations per trial, and the response patterns may not be able to be maintained over a longer trial period. Thus, the temporal stability of the response to uncertainty was examined. Results were consistent with the proposal that there is temporal stability in processing uncertainty by all age groups in an extended task, and that the results did not arise because the choice reaction time patterns were a results of shorter trials requiring less sustained effort. Chapter 6 summarised the results found in the present study and interprets those results in terms of Baddeley&#146;s (2000b) theoretical model of working memory, age related response decrements, and uncertainty. The main conclusions were that first, the fastest choice reaction time, for all age groups, is in proportion to the greater uncertainty associated with the stimulus, and in proportion to the greater uncertainty of the context in which the stimulus appears. Second, the gradual age related slowing of choice reaction time responses to the current stimulus indicated a gradual increase in the speed of decision processing within the central executive. Third, the results indicated the information temporarily held in the episodic buffer affects the speed of processing. Fourth, the results indicated that the episodic buffer ages less than the central executive. The uncertainty associated with responding to stimuli with differing probabilities of appearance was found to be an excellent instrument in examining aged changes in working memory.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158709</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Economic Analysis of Water Pricing and Water Allocation Options for the Emerald Irrigation Area: An Integrated Hydrological, Bio-Physical and Economic Modelling Approach</field><field name="creator">Franco-Dixon, Mary</field><field name="description">The economic implications of alternative water pricing and allocation methods in the Emerald Irrigation Area in the Nogoa-Mackenzie Water Supply System of the Fitzroy Basin were investigated in this study through an integrated modelling approach. This study area was chosen since it is in one of the most important catchments in Queensland in terms of its contribution to agriculture, and was in one of only three catchments in Queensland in 2004 that had Resource Operations Plans, with detailed operating rules for the water infrastructure in place. This study was initiated because of the lack of information about the farm-level impacts in the Emerald Irrigation Area of water pricing and water allocation options under Queensland&#146;s water resource planning and resource operations planning. Recent debates on the definition of water allocations and setting of water pricing emphasise the need for a rigorous yet practical model. The water model developed in this study facilitates thorough, prompt, reliable and accurate assessments of water policies and measures that may arise in the implementation of water resource planning and resource operation planning. It also provides a benchmark for determining appropriate water allocation and pricing options in other catchments in Queensland that have not progressed as far in their water management. The broad aim of this study is to assess the economic implications of water allocation and pricing options in the Fitzroy basin by developing an integrated hydrological, biophysical and economic model. The specific objectives of the thesis are: to investigate the physical and economic characteristics of irrigated farms in the Emerald Irrigation Area; to provide an overview and analysis of water pricing and allocation options; and to investigate the farm-level impacts of selected water pricing and allocation options. This study adds value to existing research by using an integrated modelling approach that linked a farm-level linear economic programming model with a hydrological model (Integrated Quality and Quantity Management model) and two bio-physical models (APSIM and OZCOT). The applied integrated modelling work enabled the economic analysis of the impacts of water pricing and allocation options to be underpinned by sound technical information. An important part of the research methods in the study was a postal survey of cotton growers in the Emerald Irrigation Area to better understand farmer responses to new water policy and to develop realistic parameters for the subsequent modelling work. To augment the survey data, relevant secondary data from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, Australian Bureau of Statistics, Queensland Department of Primary Industries and the Cotton Research and Development Corporation were collated. The literature review focussed on two main areas: applied water-related economic assessment techniques and water policy issues. The outcome of the first review demonstrated the need to use an integrated approach to determine the farm-level impact of alternative water policies. Recent research has focussed on integrating economic modelling with either bio-physical modelling or hydrological modelling but not with both. Although similar approaches have been applied with success to applications in Chile, Vietnam and other South East Asian countries, this has not been the case for research in Australia until this study. The second part of the review focused on water policy issues and provided the conceptual base for identifying water pricing and allocation options. The IQQM model provided daily hydrological data for the Emerald Irrigation Area and was organised to provide yearly flow data for 1900-95 for four nodes so as to obtain estimates of water available to the various crops in the Emerald Irrigation Area. The bio-physical simulation models of OZCOT for cotton and APSIM for sorghum, wheat and chickpeas provided the crop response to different water allocation levels under various production management scenarios such soil types, irrigation efficiencies, planting dates and starting soil water. The outputs from the bio-physical models provided the yield prediction in response to available water allocation. Mathematical programming models were developed to investigate the economic impacts on irrigators and agricultural output of different water allocation and pricing scenarios by determining optimal activity and optimal resource input levels subject to land, water and labour constraints. Two separate models were developed, both using the integrated economic-biophysical-hydrologic framework. The first was a farm-level integrated biophysical-economic-hydrologic model that quantified the direct farm-level economic impact of water allocation changes and water pricing scenarios. The second model, an extension of the base case farm-level model, incorporated monthly supply and demand for water and has the ability to reallocate water to competitive users. Both models allow for an estimation and analysis of water demand under alternative water allocation levels and water pricing regimes. Two-part pricing and tiered pricing were the two volumetric water pricing techniques analysed in this study. Sixty water pricing scenarios were assessed for four farm types. Farm adjustment responses were analysed and the derived demand for water estimated. For all farm types, the optimal solution involved growing cotton in summer with a small area of chickpeas grown in winter. Water pricing alone was not a good mechanism to reduce water consumption. Small reductions in water consumptions occur only if water prices are very high, yields are sharply reduced and farm income decreases. Significant increases in water price have a marked adverse impact on farm incomes. The analysis also reveals that adopting a &#145;two-part&#146; allocation instead of the &#145;single volumetric&#146; currently used in Queensland can have a marked effect on the response by farmers to a decrease in water available, depending on their farm type. Sensitivity analysis was conducted on key model parameters such as weather scenarios, irrigation strategies, commodity prices and cost and availability of labour. In general, the results were robust for a wide range of likely model parameters. The results provide insights into the farmers&#146; capacity to pay and to shoulder additional costs of a water price increase. It was observed that the different pricing policies produce differential effects on the four farm types considered in the study. Indirectly, the study also provides an indication of how revenues for government will be affected by any new water price changes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158710</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the role of codon usage in the signal sequence of Escherichia coli secretory proteins</field><field name="creator">Zalucki, Yaramah</field><field name="description">Non-optimal codons have been reported to occur with higher frequency in the signal sequences of secretory proteins in Escherichia coli compared to both the 5&#146; mature region of secretory and non-secretory genes (134). Non-optimal codons are defined by their low-usage in a genome, low concentrations of cognate tRNA and are associated with translational pausing. This thesis presents data on two secretory proteins, maltose binding protein (MBP) and &#946;-lactamase (Bla), which were chosen as model systems to study the role of non-optimal codons in export. For both proteins, the non-optimal codons were changed to an optimal codon within the synonymous codon family. For the optimised MBP allele (MBP-opt), there was an approximate 20-fold reduction in protein expression compared to MBP-wt. The expression of MBP-opt was partially recovered in strains deficient in multiple cytoplasmic and periplasmic proteases. This suggests that non-optimal codons are important to allow for the correct folding of the pre-protein before secretion, in particular for the signal peptide. In the &#946;-lactamase study, the optimised allele (bla-opt) had four-fold less expression compared to the wild-type allele (bla-wt). To investigate the effect of the distribution of non-optimal codons in the signal sequence for expression, a series of mutations in the signal sequence, in which only a subset of the non-optimal codons were changed to optimal, were made. This revealed that non-optimal codons at the start of the signal sequence (bla-F6) were more important for maintaining expression of &#946;-lactamase. Since bla confers resistance to ampicillin only when fully folded in the periplasm, a revertant study was carried out to select for clones that had higher resistance than those of bla-F6. This study revealed nine such revertants, which all had optimal to non-optimal codon reversions at various positions in the front half of the &#946;-lactamase signal sequence. The results of these studies in both MBP and &#946;- lactamase suggest that non-optimal codons are important for a time-critical early event in the export of proteins to the periplasm. Most prokaryotic sec dependent signal peptides have a positive charge at the Nterminus. Yet studies have shown that the positive charge is not required for export (74, 137, 174). To investigate this, the charge distribution of all sec dependent signal peptides was analysed, which revealed a massive bias for lysine at the second and third amino acid positions (P2 and P3) and a slight bias for arginine at P3. Whilst consistent with the requirement for a positive charge at the N-terminus, it raised the question as to why there was a massive bias for lysine and not arginine at P2? Investigating the codon usage at the various positions revealed that the lysine codon AAA is overrepresented at P2. Other studies have shown that codon and amino acid choice at P2 can affect translation initiation (159) and removal of f-Met by methionylamino peptidase (MAP) (51). To experimentally determine the selection constraints on codon and amino acid usage at P2 in secretory proteins, the signal sequences of MBP and alkaline phosphatase (AP) were fused to the mature region of &#946;-lactamase. Both of these signal sequences had the lysine codon AAA at P2, which was changed to various other codons and the effect on export measured by resistance to ampicillin. The results of these experiments demonstrate that a positive charge is not required for protein export, and suggest that the dominant selective pressure at P2 is for codons that promote high translation initiation efficiencies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158711</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Religion, spirituality, and mental health and social behaviour in young adulthood: A longitudinal study</field><field name="creator">Aird, Rosemary</field><field name="description">Background: The concept spirituality appears to be gaining increasing attention for its potential relationship to mental health, despite there being an absence of consensus on what spirituality is or whether it can be distinguished from religion (or religiousness) in operational terms. Spirituality is a term that is embraced within secular and non-secular contexts alike. As a consequence, spirituality as a concept encompasses forms of religiosity that are embedded in traditional religion and those that have little or no connection to traditional religious teachings. The emergence of religious/spiritual beliefs that depart from traditional religious thought represents one key feature of widespread religious change in contemporary societies. Nontraditional religious/spiritual beliefs need to be viewed within this context and thus be differentiated from traditional religious/spiritual beliefs when investigating connections between religion, spirituality, and mental health. Aims: The current study seeks to compare the mental health of those whose beliefs are rooted in religious tradition with those whose beliefs deviate from traditional religious thought. The two main objectives of this study are: (1) to determine the extent to which religious background predicts endorsement of traditional and non-traditional religious/spiritual beliefs and church attendance in young adulthood; and (2) to determine whether differential relationships exist between current religiosity, religious background, and mental health in young adulthood, and whether any observed differences are attributable to other characteristics of respondents like sociodemographic factors and health-risk behaviours. Methods: Data were derived from the Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy, a longitudinal, prospective study of maternal and child health from the prenatal period to 21 years post-delivery. Religiosity was assessed among the study children in young adulthood from three items measured at the time of the 21-year follow-up. Religious background was assessed from information provided by the study mothers in earlier phases of the study. Young adult responses to items included in the Young Adult Self Report (Achenbach, 1997) were used to assess cases of anxiety/depression and externalising behaviour, and delusional ideation was assessed from their responses to the 21-item Peters et al. Delusions Inventory (PDI) (Peters &amp; Garety, 1996). Results: Belief in a spiritual or higher power other than God was found to be positively related to anxiety/depression, disturbed ideation, suspiciousness and paranormal ideation, high total PDI scores, as well as antisocial behaviour in young adulthood, regardless of gender. These associations persisted after adjustment for potential confounders. By contrast, young adults who maintain a traditional belief in God appear to be no different to those who reject this belief in regard to anxiety/depression. Belief in God was found to have no association with antisocial behaviour for males, but was observed to have a weak negative relationship with antisocial behaviour for females. This association failed to reach statistical significance however, after adjustment for other religious/spiritual and social characteristics. No associations were found between young adult belief in God and disturbed, suspicious or paranormal ideation, although a positive relationship was identified for high total PDI scores. Weekly church attendance was observed to reduce the likelihood of antisocial behaviour in young adulthood among males, but not females. Religious ideation was found to more prevalent among young adults who attend church on either a weekly or infrequent basis. No long-term effects on anxiety/depression or antisocial behaviour were evident from maternal belief in God, church attendance or religious affiliation in the young adults&#146; early lives. However, maternal church attendance predicted religious ideation in young adulthood. Offspring of mothers affiliated with a Pentecostal church in the prenatal period appear to have a high rate of religious ideation and high total PDI scores. Paranormal ideation in young adulthood appears to have no association with maternal religiosity in a young adult&#146;s early life. Conclusion: The findings from this study suggest that young adults who endorse nontraditional religious/spiritual beliefs are at greater risk for poorer mental health and aberrant social behaviour than those who reject these beliefs. These results suggest that a non-traditional religious/spiritual belief system involves more than mere rejection of traditional religious doctrine. This system of belief may be a marker for those who question the legitimacy of established societal norms and values, and whose thoughts, attitudes and actions reflect this position. This possibility has implications for mental health and wellbeing at both an individual and a societal level and warrants further research attention.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158712</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel Genes and Proteins Associated with Non- Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease</field><field name="creator">Tsimako, Masego</field><field name="description">Real Time PCR revealed that all candidate genes selected for the study were expressed in human liver with varying levels of expression. The differential expressions of transcripts for SPFH1, MTCBP-1, GLYATL1, AK091308 and HSDL2 were determined in liver biopsies from adult NASH patients and controls. The Real Time PCR analysis revealed that MTCBP-1 was markedly up-regulated in many NASH samples (3.36-fold). Expression of SPFH1 was downregulated in NASH samples (5.3-fold, p &lt; 0.05), which was consistent with DNA microarrays (2.80-fold). The relative mean expression levels of GLYATL1 in NASH samples were variably increased above the controls. The relative mean expression levels of AK091308 and HSDL2 in NASH cases were not different to the control groups. The peptide antibodies were raised against the antigenic regions of the proteins which were predicted by the Preditop algorithm program. The antibodies against MTCBP-1 and SPFH1 detected the proteins in western blot preparations of human liver and cell lysates. MTCBP-1 and SPFH1 are highly conserved proteins which share homologies with proteins from distant species. Immunohistochemical analysis of MTCBP-1 showed the protein to be localised mainly in the hepatocyte&#146;s nucleus and cytoplasm. In hepatoma cells, MTCBP-1 was found to be intracellular localised within the nuclear and cytoplasm compartments. SPFH1 is intracellular localised with heavy clustering of the protein around the cell&#146;s nucleus and cytoplasm compartments. Triglyceride accumulation in the HepG2 fat cell model resulted in microvesicular steatosis. Increased levels of cellular triglycerides were observed in HepG2 cells incubated in FFA. The cellular triglycerides induced the expression of MTCBP-1 (p &lt; 0.05) as analysed by the integrated intensities from western blots. Immunofluorescence analysis of over-expressed MTCBP-1 revealed the protein to be distributed in the same subcellular compartments as the native protein.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158713</field></doc><doc><field name="title">FOAMING OF MILK</field><field name="creator">Voderbet, Sapna Kamath</field><field name="description">Foaming can be beneficial or undesirable depending on the temperature at/to which milk is foamed. For instance, foaming of milk is beneficial when making Italian style coffee such as cappuccino where steam from a steam generator is injected into milk to create a foam and to simultaneously heat the milk to ~ 65 &#150; 70&#176;C. Foaming of milk is undesirable during operations such as pumping of cold (5&#176;C) milk in a dairy processing plant. The main objective of this study was to develop an understanding of the foaming patterns of milk and the factors that affect the foaming properties in the temperature range 5 &#150; 85&#176;C and use this understanding to devise treatments and additives to improve/reduce the foaming of milk depending on the end stage application. A review of literature showed that very little information was available on the foaming properties of milk as a function of temperature. Moreover a clear gap existed between an understanding of the foaming properties of milk proteins in single or binary systems and the foaming properties of milk per se. Foaming properties of milk over a broad temperature range were studied using a specially designed foaming apparatus, which enabled foams to be produced under standardised conditions. Foaming patterns of a range of milks which included raw whole milk, pasteurised homogenised full-cream milk, pasteurised skim milk, UHT homogenised full-cream milk, UHT skim milk and reconstituted milks made from low-, medium- and high-heat skim milk powder, were established as a function of temperature (5 &#150; 85&#176;C). The foaming properties of a given milk were largely determined by the temperature at which milk was foamed, its fat content, and the processing conditions used during its manufacture. Skim milks had a pronounced foam stability peak at 45&#176;C when foamed over a temperature range of 5 &#150; 85&#176;C. Image analysis of skim milk foams, as observed under a light microscope, showed that the surface of skim milk foams coarsened over time. This occurred most rapidly in foams produced at 5&#176;C and least rapidly in those produced at 45&#176;C. The foaming properties of full-cream milks were largely determined by the physical state of milk fat. Milk fat was detrimental to foam formation and stability of full-cream milks when milk fat globules contained both solid and liquid fat i.e. in the temperature range 5 &#150; 40&#176;C. The extent of whey protein denaturation had a positive effect on the foam stability of reconstituted milks at lower temperatures (&lt; 45&#176;C) and a negative correlation with foam stability at higher temperatures When skim milk was separated into its micellar, ultracentrifugal and defatted ultracentrifugal fractions, the foaming pattern of the parent milk as a function of temperature (5 &#150; 85&#176;C), resembled that of the micellar fraction, with a pronounced foam stability peak at 45&#176;C. The foaming pattern of the serum phase of milk could not be determined due to precipitation of calcium, when the defatted ultracentrifugal supernatant was heated to temperatures G 45&#176;C. The sedimentable interfacial material isolated by low-speed centrifugation of collapsed skim milk foams was made up of large-sized casein micelles; particle size measurements and electrophoretic analysis of this material showed that the stability of skim milk foams was mainly determined by the ability of micellar caseins to adsorb and form a stabilising network at the air&#150; serum interface of the foams. Addition of calcium-chelating agents, which increased the non-micellar casein content of milk, decreased foam stability, while addition of calcium salts, which increased the micellar casein content of milk, increased foam stability, reinforcing the observation that adsorption of micellar caseins is required for the stability of skim milk foams. The role of whey proteins in the stabilisation of skim milk foams could not be determined from a study of the sedimentable interfacial material, as they were lost in the supernatant during low speed centrifugation of skim milk foams. Lipolysis as measured by the FFA content of milk had a negative effect on the steam foaming properties of milk, with foamability and foam stability decreasing and the coarseness of foam increasing with an increase in the FFA content. The destabilising effect of the products of lipolysis was higher when milk was foamed at lower temperatures. A good correlation was observed between surface tension, FFA content and foam stability of milk. However, natural variations in other surface active components of milk such as fat, protein and phospholipids, tend to mask the effect of changing FFA content on the surface tension value of milk and as a result it was difficult to arrive at an absolute surface tension value of milk below which foaming properties of milk were adversely affected. Increasing the total solids content of milk decreased foamability and increased foam stability due to an increase in the viscosity coupled with an increase in the amount of protein available for adsorption at the air&#150;serum interface of milk foams. As in the case of increasing total solids content, addition of H-carrageenan decreased foamability and increased the foam stability of milk, due to an increase in viscosity of the milk. Emulsification of oils such as olive, canola and sunflower oils in skim milk using a microfluidiser resulted in a pronounced increase in the foam stability of milk. The foaming patterns of milks containing oil instead of milk fat resembled that of skim milk with a pronounced foam stability peak at 45&#176;C. This suggested that lipids which are fully liquid above 0&#176;C are not detrimental to the foaming properties of milk foamed in the temperature range 5 &#150; 85&#176;C. The higher foam stability of milks containing added oil, when compared to the parent skim milk, was attributed to an increase in the viscosity of milk as a result of the added oil. Pre-heat treatment of milk to temperatures G 65&#176;C altered the foaming properties of milk. The foamability of milk increased with an increase in the temperature of preheat treatment from 65 to 85&#176;C, while the foam stability was highest when milk was subjected to a pre-heat treatment of 65&#176;C. Lowering of the measurable FFA content of milk, by the likely binding of FFA to BSA and I-lactoglobulin, and the lack of whey protein denaturation, could be responsible for the higher foam stability of milk subjected to a pre-heat treatment of 65&#176;C. The present study represents a significant step forward in understanding the foaming behavior of milk, which is determined by the complex interplay between temperature, the structure, conformation and distribution of milk proteins, and the nature of other components of milk such as fat, mineral salts and FFAs. An understanding of the importance of caseins in the stabilisation of milk foams and the effect of the physical state of milk fat on the foaming properties of milk, achieved in the present study, opens up exciting avenues for the manipulation of the foaming behavior of milk, especially to produce specialty milks with improved foaming properties.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158714</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MODIFICATION OF DREDGED SEDIMENTS TO PRODUCE USEFUL PRODUCT BY HEATING TO HIGH TEMPERATURES</field><field name="creator">Wong, Leong Toh</field><field name="description">The disposal of large quantity of dredged sediments on land has long been an issue, particularly when significant contaminants are present. Heating fine-grained dredged sediments to high temperatures can convert these problematic sediments into materials that can be used beneficially. It can both improve considerably the geotechnical engineering properties of the sediment, and neutralise contaminants. Furthermore, this process can reduce the amount of sediment disposed of on land. The sand, silt, and clay fractions of dredged sediments are essentially different in their mineralogical composition, becoming more complex with decreasing particle size. The clay fraction has the greatest influence on the effects of thermal stabilisation. Consequently, a broad knowledge of the quantities and types of sediments produced and the range of their geotechnical engineering properties and their contaminants is a prerequisite for successful, cost-efficient modification of dredged sediments by heating. Numerous alternative methods of soil stabilisation have been used with dredged sediments, but none offers the range of benefits afforded by thermal stabilisation. It is the most reliable method of soil improvement, and the only method that gives immediate results. The laboratory and industrial-scale research presented here shows that there is definite potential for dredged sediment to be incorporated cost-effectively in a variety of industrial manufacturing processes, and in engineering applications following high-temperature heat treatment. Potential products include sand and gravel for road base, solid fill and bricks, among others. Firing fine-grained marine or riverine sediments to high temperatures can convert them to good quality sand and gravel with high frictional shear strength and high permeability. Artificial gravel has been produced that satisfies the Queensland Main Roads Department requirements for use as Subtype 2.5 unbound pavement material. Heat treatment destroys or stabilises organic contaminants such as tributyltin, common salt, which is converted into other minerals when heated to high temperatures, and other inorganic contaminants. Although the cost of heat treatment can be higher than that of other common treatment methods, this can be offset by the sale of the end products. No other single treatment method is capable of both improving the engineering properties of dredged sediment and eliminating or immobilising its contaminants. The industrial-scale testing verified that the use of sediment as raw material for brick manufacturing is possible and is not only the cheapest way to recycle the dredged sediment, but also replaces source raw material for brick manufacturing. Dried sediment in reclamation ponds can now be recycled easily and maintenance costs are thereby reduced. The use of recycled sediment as raw material for brick manufacturing also reduces the cost of raw materials by about 20%. It is thus a long-term partial solution to problems faced by both port authorities and brick manufacturers. Analytical and numerical solutions of the desiccation of the dredged sediment disposed of on land have been presented that enable the moisture content profile of the sediment at particular time to be estimated. However, further validation is necessary. The solutions, when fully validated, will provide a useful tool for the management of dredged sediment in disposal ponds and for the desiccation of sediments prior to thermal stabilisation processes. The estimated direct cost of thermal stabilisation is competitive with that of alternative methods, and it should be possible to reduce the overall cost of sediment disposal by the sale of stabilised material for beneficial uses, and the reuse of existing sediment holding ponds. Overall, it has been shown that thermal stabilisation has the potential to reduce considerably the problem of the disposal of ever-increasing volumes of dredged sediments that have problematic engineering properties and/or are significantly contaminated.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158715</field></doc><doc><field name="title">STRATEGIC RESPONSE IN A VOLATILE ENVIRONMENT: THE CASE OF THE INDONESIAN TV BROADCASTING INDUSTRY</field><field name="creator">Pandin, Marcelino</field><field name="description">Operating and competing in volatile environments, such as in Indonesia&#146;s TV broadcasting industry during the period 1989-2005, will always be a challenge for companies, regardless of their size or years in operation. Frequent regulatory changes, transient competitiveness, shortening program lifecycles, hypercompetition, and high uncertainty are characteristic of business volatility. Responding strategically to these circumstances helps ensure a firm&#146;s competitiveness and sustainability. This study is about firms&#146; strategic responses in a volatile environment. Literature examining both the resource-based view (RBV) and the capability-based view (CBV) of the firm indicates that a firm&#146;s co-evolutionary uses of its resources and capabilities underpin strategic responses to volatile environments. However, the co-evolutionary relationship between a firm&#146;s resources and its capabilities has not been well understood to date, despite calls from strategic management researchers to investigate this fundamental issue. By exploring this issue, we can better understand changes in firms&#146; competitive advantage and disadvantage over time. Therefore, this research aims to answer the question: How does a firm respond to a volatile environment through the co-evolution of its resources with its capabilities? Ten free-to-air TV firms, which made up the total population of Indonesia&#146;s TV private broadcasting industry, were the setting for investigating this research question, by means of case study. These firms operated and competed in Indonesia&#146;s volatile business environment in 1989-2005. Data were collected over a two-year period in 2004 - 2005 from key informants, observations, company documents, and publicly available secondary sources. The collected historical events of the observed firms were then reconstructed and systemised in a case study report for each of the firms, and also in an aggregate industry report on Indonesia&#146;s rapidly changing TV broadcasting industry. To analyse the collected data, a five-step investigation strategy was developed and used. Using the three-stage capability lifecycle model of Helfat &amp; Peteraf (2003), the first step of the investigation strategy reconstructed each of the TV firms&#146; capability trajectories. The second step identified critical events along the capability trajectory and their determinants. These events triggered by the volatile environment and internal factors within the observed TV firms were labelled as capability-critical events. The third step investigated the firms&#146; salient resources that played significant roles in dealing with the critical events. The fourth step reassembled the resources into configurations at the firms&#146; capability founding, maturity, and development stages. The final step examined the performance impacts of the resource configurations at different capability stages. The processes of data collection and data analysis for this research were conducted in parallel and resulted in the finding that a firm responds to its volatile environment by continuously reconfiguring its four salient resources of dominant logic, network capital, routine design, and social cohesion at different capability stages. These resources were configured idiosyncratically at different capability stages, creating simultaneously a series of transient competitive advantages and internal system stabilities. These main findings lead to the development of a process model for firms&#146; strategic responses in a volatile environment. The process model can be used as a road map for a firm aiming to become a self-renewing organisation, which can perform and respond strategically in volatile environments where competitiveness is short-lived. By examining strategic responses in such rapidly changing and turbulent environments, this research reviews and extends theories in the RBV and the CBV of the firm, particularly in regards to capability lifecycle, co-evolution, self-renewing organisation, and performance perspectives on firms&#146; resources.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158716</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE LANGUAGE OF ECONOMIC RATIONALISM A CRITICAL DISCOURSE ANALYSIS OF HOWARD&#146;S TAX METAPHORS</field><field name="creator">McKell, Sue Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This dissertation is an exploration of the language of economic rationalism, as seen through a Critical Discourse Analysis of the Australian Prime Minister, John Howard&#146;s, discussion of the proposed Goods and Services Tax in speeches during the 1998 Federal election. In order to examine the language of economic rationalism through an analysis of tax-related discourse, this thesis first examines the theory of economic rationalism in detail and provides a justification for using the Goods and Services Tax (GST) as a key example of neoclassical economic policy and, in turn, of economic rationalism. Critical Discourse Analysis provides the methodological basis for this study, and conceptual metaphors used by John Howard in tax-related discourse are isolated through a combination of both quantitative and qualitative strategies of textual analysis. This thesis identifies three primary conceptual metaphors used by Howard in discussing the issue of tax: two metaphors that described the new tax being proposed, labelled as TAX-AS-MEDICINE and GST-ASREVOLUTION; and a third metaphor that was used to characterise the existing tax regime as a BROKEN MACHINE. Through these metaphors, Howard was able to paint a picture of the GST that was dynamic, forward-looking and positive, yet one that privileges a macro-level and disindividualised view of society. These metaphors support a range of neoclassical principles underlying economic rationalism, including the principle that social progress is best achieved through indirect government intervention, and reveal ideologies based in nationalism where the individual is relegated as secondary to society as a whole.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158717</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robust Face Recognition for Video Surveillance Using a Single Gallery Image</field><field name="creator">Shan, Ting</field><field name="description">In recent years, the use of Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) for crime prevention and detection has attracted significant attention and focus, especially after the 11 September 2001 attack on New York&#146;s World Trade Center and London bombings in July 2005. Existing face recognition systems require passport-quality photos to achieve satisfying results, but using CCTV images is much more problematic due to the large variations in lighting conditions, facial expression and pose angle. Recently, Chen and Lovell (2004) developed a new face recognition algorithm, known as Adaptive Principal Component Analysis (APCA), which performs well in the presence of variations in expression and lighting conditions. But like other PCA-derived face recognition algorithms, APCA only performs well with frontal face images. Following the approach of Cootes et al (2001), in this thesis we develop a face model and a rotation model which can be used to interpret facial features and synthesize realistic frontal face images when given a single novel face image. A Viola-Jones based face detector is used to detect faces in real-time and thus solves the initialization problem for our Active Appearance Model search. It can handle pose changes of &#177; 25 degrees from the frontal view. The work is then extended to accommodate large variations in head pose. A left face model and a right face model are used to represent larger face variation information; a correlation model is developed which can be used to transform the face images from the left or right rotation models to the frontal rotation model. Experiments show that our approach can achieve good recognition rates on face images across a wide range of head poses. Indeed recognition rates are improved by up to a factor of 5 compared to standard PCA. Based on the fact that an individual&#146;s facial features and pose determine the appearance of a person at specific pose, a new face recognition method without synthesis of images is proposed. It uses statistical face models to interpret face information and a correlation model to remove the pose effect. The resultant pose-independent features are measured by Mahalanobis distance and cosine measure for classification. Finally a real time face recognition system, which integrates three major components, is proposed: 1) a Viola-Jones face detection module based on cascaded simple binary features to rapidly detect and locate multiple faces from the input still image or video sequences, 2) a normalization module based on the eye locations detected by a Viola- Jones eye detector. 3) Adaptive Principal Component Analysis to recognize the detected faces. This system demonstrates that it is indeed viable to use face recognition as a part of an intelligent CCTV system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158718</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DISCOVERY AND CHARACTERISATION OF CONOPEPTIDE ANTAGONISTS OF NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE RECEPTORS</field><field name="creator">Loughnan, Marion</field><field name="description">Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are of crucial physiological importance and they have also been implicated in a number of pathological conditions thus representing important targets for pharmacological intervention. Knowledge of the structure-function relationships of receptor: ligand interactions can facilitate design of improved pharmacological tools and drugs. The venoms of predatory marine snails (Conus spp.) contain diverse mixtures of peptide toxins with high potency and selectivity for a variety of voltage-gated and ligand-gated ion channels. The toxins are unusually rich in post-translationally modified amino acids, the significance of which is not well understood. The aims of this thesis were to discover new conotoxin antagonists of nAChRs, to investigate the roles of post-translationally modified amino acids in &#945;-conotoxins, and to improve prediction of sites of posttranslational modifications in conotoxins. The discovery and characterisation of several novel &#945;-conotoxins and posttranslationally modified peptides identified by a functional assay and by LC/MS of crude venom extracts from several species of cone snails was described (Chapter 2). The most interesting species was Conus anemone with activities at a range of neuronal nAChR subtypes. Three sulfated &#945;-conotoxins-AnIA, AnIB and AnIC- were identified by LC/MS and assay directed fractionation, and sequenced after purification. Synthetic AnIB exhibited subnanomolar potency at the rat &#945;3&#946;2 nAChR and was 200-fold less active on the rat &#945;7 nAChR. Reassessment of Conus aulicus crude venom revealed a sulfotyrosinylated variant of AuIA. Prediction of the likelihood of sulfation of tyrosine residues in &#945;-conotoxins was consistent with observations of sulfotyrosinylation. The roles of some post-translationally modified amino acid residues, including sulfotyrosine, y-carboxyglutamic acid and hydroxyproline, were investigated by chemical and functional characterisation of variants of known &#945;-conotoxins (Chapter 3). AnIB was selected as an example of a sulfotyrosinylated &#945;-conotoxin, and activities of sulfated and non-sulfated AnIB variants at two murine nAChR subtype combinations were compared. The unsulfated peptide [Tyr16]AnIB showed a two-fold and ten-fold decrease in activity at &#945;3&#946;2 (IC50 0.6 nM) and &#945;7 (IC50 836 nM) nAChRs, respectively. GID was selected as a model for y-carboxyglutamic acid and hydroxyproline in &#945;-conotoxins. Substitution of glutamic aid or glycine for y- carboxyglutamic acid at position 4 of GID, and substitution of proline for hydroxyproline at position 16 of GID, did not markedly alter affinity for nAChRs. Several well-characterised &#945;-conotoxins were selected to study the effects of substitution of hydroxyproline for the conserved proline in Loop I, and this change in variants of [A10L]PnIA, PnIA and EI, but not ImI, resulted in loss of activity. The post-translationally modified residue provided a useful tool to further probe the interactions between &#945;-conotoxins and nAChRs or their homologue, acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP). The discovery, and the chemical and functional characterisation of three novel conotoxins - &#945;D-VxXIIA, &#945;D-VxXIIB and &#945;D-VxXIIC - purified from the venom of Conus vexillum was described (Chapter 4). The &#945;D-conotoxin family is a new category of peptides in the venom of some Conus species from Clade XII. Each toxin was observed as an ~11 kDa protein by LC/MS, size exclusion chromatography and SDS-PAGE. The peptide sequences were determined by Edman degradation chemistry and tandem MS. Combining the sequence data together with LC/MS and NMR data revealed that in solution these toxins are pseudohomodimers of paired 47&#150; 50 residue peptides. The toxin subunits exhibited a novel arrangement of ten conserved cystine residues and post-translational modifications (y-carboxyglutamic acid and hydroxyproline) contributed heterogeneity to the proteins. Binding assays and two-electrode voltage clamp analyses showed that &#945;D-VxXIIA, &#945;D-VxXIIB and &#945;D-VxXIIC are potent inhibitors of nAChRs, with selectivity for &#945;7 and &#946;2- containing neuronal nAChR subtypes. These dimeric conopeptides appear to be a fifth and highly divergent structural class of conotoxins targeting nAChRs. Several cDNA sequences encoding &#945;D-conotoxins in the venom of four species, C. vexillum, Conus capitaneus, Conus miles and Conus mustelinus, were determined (Chapter 5). The complete nucleic acid coding sequence for VxXIIA from C. vexillum was obtained. Related prepropeptide sequences, obtained by PCR and RACE analyses, shared the expected features of a moderately conserved signal peptide region and a variable mature toxin region. The signal peptide sequences displayed more heterogeneity than previously reported for other conotoxin superfamilies, with differing signal peptide sequence motifs defining two distinct groups of &#945;D-conotoxin precursors. The predicted mature toxin sequences could be matched with partial Nterminal peptide sequences of components with nAChR antagonist activity, allowing resolution of the previously incomplete study.

Whilst a range of tools exists to support designers once a system has been specified there are few if any tools available to assist in system-level specification. Our aim is to provide a tool that is not only capable of selecting the most appropriate processor cores required to meet performance deadlines, but also cost and energy criteria as well. Given an existing software application, our tool will select appropriate (possibly heterogeneous) processor cores from a design library; allocate the various software functions to each processor; and provide a static task execution schedule. Point-to-point communication links are used. Both their cost and energy requirements are also accounted for. Total system cost and energy requirements are hence provided. In cases where a solution's performance exceeds the performance deadline, the tool will use the available slack space to stretch the execution and reduce the operating voltage. Thereby resulting in a reduction in energy. Our tool uses a probabilistic search method derived from the field of Evolutionary Algorithms called Differential Evolution. We utilise the domain knowledge present in a scheduling algorithm to form the fitness function, thereby, creating a problem-space evolutionary search. Two schedulers of differing complexity are investigated: a priority-list scheduler and a critical-path scheduler. A number of benchmarks are used for comparison to previous work. In addition, an extensive study is made of two of the benchmarks to understand the effects a change of application has: Firstly, on the effectiveness of the evolutionary approach; Secondly, on the tuning parameters necessary to obtain rapid, consistent location of the global optimum solution or Pareto solutions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158720</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of stakeholder power on a destination branding process: The Gold Coast VeryGC brand</field><field name="creator">Marzano, Giuseppe</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Place marketing</field><field name="subject">Tourism -- Marketing</field><field name="subject">Gold Coast (Qld.)</field><field name="subject">Power</field><field name="subject">Collaboration</field><field name="subject">Stakeholder</field><field name="subject">Destination branding</field><field name="subject">Gold Coast</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158722</field></doc><doc><field name="title">IMPROVING SELECTION IN SUGARCANE BREEDING PROGRAMS WITH AN APPLICATION IN THE BURDEKIN REGION, AUSTRALIA</field><field name="creator">Hu, Fengduo</field><field name="description">Sugarcane breeding programs traditionally have three main components &#150; collection and evaluation of germplasm, cross-pollination, and selection. Selection is a critical and most costly component of breeding programs and is used for the identification and release of elite cultivars from the original seedling populations developed from cross-pollination. Effective selection systems are essential in all sugarcane breeding programs. The study presented in this thesis has investigated alternative selection system options in sugarcane breeding programs, using the Burdekin region, Australia, as a case study. To achieve this, three parts of an overall research plan have been conducted. Firstly, a sugarcane selection simulation model was established. This was designed to represent selection in sugarcane selection systems after the initial seedling phase of selection. The model was based on assumptions about key genetic and statistical parameters (genetic variance for key traits commercial cane sugar (CCS) and cane yield, error variances for different trial designs, competition variance, genetic correlations between CCS and cane yield) from previously published data. Two alternative selection systems named SS1 and SS2 were simulated. SS1 followed 2 stages of clonal selection (following the seedling phase S1) similar to that currently used in Australian sugarcane breeding programs. SS2 followed 3 stages of clonal selection following seedlings, similar to a design suggested from previous research. Secondly, SS1 and SS2 were subsequently compared through field trials. Experimental clones entered into SS1 and SS2 were seedlings selected from the first stage of a commercial breeding program conducted by CSR Ltd. in the Burdekin region, and were therefore considered representative of clonal populations typically entering the second stage of selection in sugarcane breeding programs. This enabled further estimates of the key statistical parameters assumed initially in the model to be done. This included studying factors affecting selection such as plot size and GE interaction. Results from the field trials also allowed predicted genetic gains from the model to be compared with realized gains in practice, and allowed refinement of the model. Genetic and error variances for CCS were similar between the 5m and 10m single row plots and visual ratings in the 5m plots gave heritabilities similar in size to cane yield measured in 10m plots, suggesting that the 5m plots would be as effective as 10m plots for improving CCS and cane yield in large plots. Genetic variance for CCS was similar between single row plots and multiple row plots in the same environment, while genetic variance for cane yield was larger in single row plots than in multiple row plots. Error variances for both CCS and cane yield in single row plots were more than twice as large as those in multiple row plots. CCS measured in single plots either in plant or ratoon crops was highly correlated with CCS measured in 4-row plots in the same environment. This correlation (&#177; standard error) was 0.92&#177;0.14 for the plant crop and 1.07&#177; 0.52 for the ratoon crop. For TCH, the corresponding genetic correlation was 0.47&#177;0.16 for the plant crop and 0.04 &#177;0.21 for the ratoon crop. For the genetic correlations of cane yield or visual ratings between single row plots in stage 2 trials and multiple rows in final stage trials, cane yield had a correlation (0.66&#177;0.17) which was not substantially greater in magnitude than visual rating (0.50&#177;0.18). These results suggest that CCS measured in single row plots is not biased and selection in single row plots would be effective for improving performance of CCS in large plots. By contrast, cane yield measured in single row plots is biased due to the severe competition involved in single row plots. Visual ratings as a selection criterion is nearly as effective as measured cane yield in single row plots for selection for cane yield in large plots. Genotype x crop-year interaction was not significant (P&gt;0.05) for selected clones, suggesting that selection from the plant crop was effective. The results from comparison of gains from field trials between SS1 and SS2 suggested that the joint effect of the negative genetic correlation between CCS and TCH and pre selection pressure on CCS at stage 2 significantly reduced gains, in terms of relative economic value (REV). Therefore, stage 2 selection should use an optimal selection index that combines CCS and cane yield, considering the joint effects of competition, the negative genetic correlation between CCS and cane yield, experimental error, GE interaction, and relative economic value of CCS and cane yield. Simulation studies indicated that within the same experimental design, there were very similar gains predicted in using sugar yield and net merit grade (NMG, which is a index used to date in the Australian sugarcane breeding programs), but a selection index giving optimal weighting to CCS and cane yield gave more than 20% higher gains (REV) than sugar yield or NMG. Thirdly, the results obtained from the model were compared with field trial results. Following this, the selection simulation model was validated and used to explore alternative selection system designs for selecting clones after stage 1 (seedlings) in sugarcane breeding programs. Sensitivity analysis was conducted when exploring alternative selection systems to investigate the impact of changing assumptions about parameters on systems predicted to give the best gains. With a similar level of resource inputs, three stages of clonal selection after stage 1 (as used in SS2) were predicted to provide greater total gains (REV) from selection than the current 2 stages (SS1) of selection. This was achieved under a population of 1600 to 2000 clones evaluated in stage 2 in 5m x 1-row plots and a population of clones from 130 to150 selected for stage 3 and a population of 25 clones selected for the final stage of selection in 10m x 4-row plots. The corresponding designs for replication and sites in each stage were 2 replicates per site x 1 site for stage 2, 1 replicate per site x 4 sites for stage 3 and 2 replicates per site x 4 sites for the final stage of selection, respectively. This was considered as an optimal selection system design identified for the Burdekin region in terms of the achieved highest gains in total (REV). Therefore, the current selection system in the Burdekin region should be changed to the selection system recommended above. This model provides a template for an accurate comparison of a number of alternative selection systems and subsequently, optimisation of all design variables. This model allows the analysis of some important factors affecting genetic gains, e.g. the negative genetic correlations between CCS and TCH, crop classes and optimal selection indices. This model can be used independently and easily applied to other Australia regions to evaluate different selection systems as designed here, by updating the parameters to represent a particular situation. Therefore, this model as a tool is easy to be used by plant breeders for assessment of alternative selection systems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158723</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology and Conservation Status of the black-shanked douc (Pygathrix nigripes) in Nui Chua and Phuoc Binh National Parks, Ninh Thuan Province, Vietnam</field><field name="creator">Hoang, Duc Minh</field><field name="description">The importance of understanding determinants underlining distribution, abundance, social organization and feeding ecology of animal has become increasingly vital to develop either appropriate in-situ or ex-situ conservation plans for endangered species. This study applied ecological and socioecological models to determine the habitat preferences, social organisation and feeding ecology of the black-shanked douc (Pygathrix nigripes Milne- Edwards, 1871), an endangered primate with a restricted distribution in southern Vietnam and eastern Cambodia. Using a systematic survey this thesis provides the first evaluation the distribution patterns of the black-shanked douc; the first assessment of social structure, home range and feeding ecology of the species in Nui Chua and Phuoc Binh National Parks. This thesis also provides the first model to predict the potential of occurrence of a regional douc population in Ninh Thuan Province. This study found that the black-shanked douc distributed at a wide range of elevation from sea level to as much as 1,500 m and in various vegetation types including mixed coniferous/broadleaf forest, sub-montain evergreen forest, sclerophyll evergreen forest, mixed bamboo/broadleaf forest, semi-deciduous forest, deciduous forest, scrubs and thorny woodland. The black-shanked douc preferred foraging on trees growing in a gully area or along streams. The species also avoided areas which did not support its locomotion or provide food, or which was too close to human habitation. Its distribution was associated with the season and influenced by steepness, position on landscape, the nearest distance to a water source and vegetation types. The results also revealed that abiotic factors generally influenced indirectly the distribution of the douc through the distribution of food patches. Demographic data from Nui Chua and Phuoc Binh NPs showed a large population of the black-shanked douc. The minimum number recorded in Nui Chua and Phuoc Binh NPs was 470 and 163 respectively. Within populations, the proportion of immature was higher than mature. The doucs live in groups with mean of group size in Nui Chua and Phuoc Binh populations were 13.06 &#177; 9.60 and 10.13 &#177; 5.03 respectively. The species exhibited a flexible organization of one male unit and the band. The proportion of female in groups as well as in populations outweighted that of males with a typical sex ratio numbering two females to one male. The effects of ecological factors on social structure of the species were not confirmed. However, fission of groups may occur due to mating competition. Mean home range estimated for three groups of the black-shanked douc ranged between 30 and 50 ha. Comparison of home range between two different group sizes did not differ significantly. Mean of daily path length was 952 &#177; 228 m. Groups that lived in low quality forest travelled significantly longer distances than groups that lived in high quality forest. Activity patterns of the black-shanked douc were typical to colobines. The species spent more time feeding and moving in early morning and late afternoon and more time resting from 11:00 to 14:00. The activity budget was associated with day light hours and seasons. In the dry season, the doucs increased time feeding and reduced time resting while they reduced time feeding and increased time resting in the rainy season. Activity budget was not significantly different either between males and females or between adults and juveniles. The black-shanked douc ate 152 plant species. They consumed leaves from 117 plant species, fruit from 42 species, flower from 17 species, seeds from 11 species and petioles of one species. The diet of the black-shanked douc comprised 54.6% of leaves, 29.34% of fruits, 14.56% of flowers and 1.51% other. Type of food consumed was significantly associated with day light hours, months and seasons. The black-shanked douc consumed more fruits and fewer flowers in the morning and less fruits and more flowers in the afternoon. They also ate more fruits in the rainy season and more leaves and flowers in the dry season. This study also found that, the black-shanked douc may broadly distribute in Ninh Thuan Province. A model of potential habitat predicted the doucs may occur in around 76,000 ha and about 30000 ha (less than 10% of the total area) probably has a probability of occurrence of over 50% based on physical site characteristics. Forests of Ninh Thuan Province may support 2600 to 5900 douc individuals. However, the biggest problem was that suitable habitat was fragmented. The large forest remnants act as sink for recolonisation of small forest patches and the metapopulation of the douc in Ninh Thuan Province may maintain themselves if suitable management plans are applied.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158724</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#145;This is What Happens When You Get Extremely Happy&#146; And There&#146;s a Track Winding Back: The Road Less Travelled</field><field name="creator">Connolly, Maureen Therese</field><field name="description">This thesis has a strong research component; the discipline was to write a creative dissertation and a critical essay within this research. The Creative dissertation is entitled This Is What Happens When You Get Extremely Happy and is set in 1973 at Hornet Bank Station, Central Queensland. The critical essay is called There&#146;s a Track Winding Back: The Road Less Traveled. Together these to pieces explore the relationship between Australian Baby Boomers and the generation of World War Two; the Hammerstein musicals, Carousel, Oklahoma, Show Boat, and South Pacific; and the role of the musical form in popular entertainments. Thematically, Hammerstein&#146;s musicals engaged with the pressing social issues of this time: he wrote of the importance of spiritual place and rural community. Research undertaken for this thesis found Hammerstein&#146;s musicals to criticise excessive bonding and bridging when it occurred at the expense of bridging the divides between them, alienating those groups positioned as &#145;different&#146;. The analysis proceeds by associative layering. Reflections on musical history give way to the study of human behaviour. The social sciences, particularly Robert Putnam&#146;s theory of social capital, are linked with Hammerstein&#146;s librettos. Jung&#146;s theories of duality and the Orpheus/Eurydice legend are used to textually reread the position of women in these musicals. The Australian context for this research was the historical events that took place at Hornet Bank Station in Central Queensland. There , in 1857, a group of Jimman men launched a dawn raid to revenge the rape of indigenous women by white invaders. Eleven Europeans were killed setting off a series of vicious reprisal attacks. The creative dissertation is a transportation of this same material and incorporates a large oral history component, involving members of the Aboriginal community in Brisbane, which sought to provide a cultural memory of the historical events that took place at Hornet Bank Station in 1857. An unreconciled tension between indigenous spirituality and foreign spiritualities informs much of the work herein. The three main characters of my play are Gloria, Genevieve and Ivy. Gloria and Genevieve are both unaware of the myths and legends of their European ancestry. They undertake a spiritual quest, but in doing so break a promise to God. The atonement they must make brings them into conflict with Ivy, who makes them question the foundations of their beliefs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158726</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CLONING AND HETEROLOGOUS EXPRESSION OF ANTITUMOUR ANTIBIOTIC GENE CLUSTERS</field><field name="creator">Sarovich, Derek</field><field name="description">The indolocarbazoles are a significant group of naturally occurring antitumour antibiotics well known to medical science. They possess a range of activities including anticancer, immunosuppressive and anti-hypertension properties. In 2000, it was discovered that the core of all indolocarbazoles was being synthesised by a highly conserved enzyme, named indolocarbazole synthase (ICS). The first indolocarbazole to be isolated and characterized was the strikingly purple pigmented violacein from Chromobacterium violaceum. Following the isolation of violacein, several other indolocarbazoles have been isolated including rebeccamycin and the well-known staurosporine. In the current study, a number of genetic tools were developed for the screening, isolation, characterisation and expression of the indolocarbazole gene clusters, with wider applicability for other multi-gene synthesis pathways. Due to the conserved nature of the ICS present in all indolocarbazole clusters, a PCR-based screening method was designed to detect the ICS gene. The assay was successful in detecting the presence of the ICS in both the violacein and rebeccamycin gene clusters. A second PCRbased screening method was designed that allowed distinction between the violacein cluster and other indolocarbazole clusters. The PCR-based assays designed in this work have potential utility for screening environmental isolates and DNA libraries for the presence of known or novel indolocarbazole clusters. The current vectors used for the isolation of indolocarbazoles and other multigene pathways are inadequate for a number of reasons. Firstly, cloning vectors encoding the synthesis of toxic metabolites are often unstable in the Escherichia coli host. Secondly, most vectors possess a limited host range and cannot be transferred to heterologous hosts other than E. coli for screening purposes. Therefore, the current study describes the construction of a number of novel vectors that facilitated the cloning of both single and multi-gene phenotypes in the E. coli host. One of these vectors, pPSX, is a 14-kilobase (kb) vector derived from the IncW plasmid pR388. pPSX is highly stable in E. coli in the absence of antibiotic selection, even while expressing the toxic indolocarbazole antitumour antibiotic violacein. The incorporation of the lambda cos sequence enables construction of cosmid libraries with inserts ranging from 24 to 36kb. The inclusion of a lacZ&#146; gene fragment and the multiple cloning site (MCS) from pUC18 allows blue-white screening. pPSX cosmids can be extracted from the host cell in large amounts using commercial plasmid extraction kits, facilitating downstream analysis and sequencing of cloned DNA. Like pR388, pPSX has a broad host range and can be transferred from E. coli to a wide variety of heterologous hosts by either electroporation or mobilisation. While it shows less stability in non-E. coli hosts without antibiotic selection, heterologous host strains such as Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Pseudomonas stutzeri will maintain the plasmid under antibiotic selection to allow screening of expressed inserts. pPSX provides the benefits of large insert sizes with high stability to allow cloning of chemotherapeutic gene clusters in E. coli and a range of other heterologous hosts. In addition to pPSX, a PCR product (amplicon) cloning vector, pPSY, was designed to directly clone amplicons using the commercial cloning kit, pGEM&#174;- T-Easy. The pPSY vector is able to clone and express single gene phenotypes from both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Like pPSX, pPSY is completely stable in the E. coli host and is easily transferred to a range of heterologous hosts, including P. stutzeri and R. sphaeroides. Finally, the P. stutzeri host was altered to allow the transfer of DNA libraries from E. coli. To facilitate this transfer, the native restriction system of the P. stutzeri host was removed. This restrictionless mutant showed dramatic increases (1000x) in electroporation frequency of plasmid DNA. Using this strain pPSX cosmid clone banks, constructed in E. coli, can be moved into P. stutzeri for screening purposes. In addition, pPSX has the potential to be used as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) vector, allowing direct cloning of inserts of up to 300kb into either E. coli or P. stutzeri. It is envisaged that the vectors and strains developed in this study will have wide applicability in cloning and heterologous expression of single and multiple gene phenotypes from both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. These vectors and strains can be used for initial cloning and downstream analysis of gene pathways, which may not be possible using currently available vectors. Of particular interest are the many indolocarbazole antitumour antibiotic gene clusters and other chemotherapeutic gene clusters yet to be discovered within the genetically diverse streptomycetes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158727</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A New Architecture for Virtual Private Networking with Reconfigurable System-on-Chip Technology</field><field name="creator">Wee, Chin</field><field name="description">As Internet connectivity becomes ubiquitous, so does the need for network safety and security. The major concerns are to keep private data secure from unwanted access and this can be done using a virtual private network (VPN). Current VPN technologies based on embedded systems with software-only algorithm implementations are difficult to scale to the network speeds and algorithmic complexity required. A solution to this problem will be proposed in this research project using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based reconfigurable Systemon- Chip (rSoC) technology A 3DES-CBC core with key generator that achieves more than 100Mbit/s of encryption or decryption while occupying about 608 slices in a Xilinx FPGA is presented. This will allow the 3DES core to be implemented in much smaller FPGAs or put together with other cores to form the rSoC on the same chip. Coupling the flexibility of the rSoC and hardware cipher cores can be an effective solution to the current real world requirement for a flexible and affordable VPN platform. The accessible performance of hardware cryptographic accelerator cores after integration to a reconfigurable System-on-Chip is a relatively unexplored area. There is also little work done on a stream aware cipher core for reconfigurable systems. This thesis presents a novel architecture, the Multi Stream Cipher Architecture (MSCA), which allows a cipher core to operate on multiple cipher streams without software context switching. This architecture will also allow a single point of interface for multiple different cipher cores to be integrated with the reconfigurable System-on-Chip. The architecture is integrated to the MicroBlaze soft-processor running the uClinux operating system. Different access methods in uClinux are also examined in this thesis. A user space device driver has been written in uClinux to access the cryptographic architecture. It can achieve a throughput of 45Mbps. The kernel space device driver has also been written in uClinux to run on the Open Crypto Framework (OCF). This driver can achieve a maximum throughput of 12Mbps but offers various other benefits compared to the user space driver. A popular VPN application for PC-based Linux systems has also been ported to uClinux and the performance tested. Based on the results of these evaluations, this thesis also examines the implications of using different access methods specifically their performance and accessibility.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158728</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tourism, Gender and Ethnicity in West New Britain</field><field name="creator">McGavin, Kirsten</field><field name="description">Tourism is often presented as a positive long term sustainable method of development (especially in third world countries) that does not destroy the environment as might other forms of development (such as logging and mining). However, the impacts of tourism are not always positive in relation to Indigenous cultural practices, with pressures from within the tourism industry placing emphasis on cultural &#145;authenticity&#146;, which in turn may rely on the stagnation of &#145;culture&#146;. Conversely, foreign based conservation goals linked to some forms of international tourism pressure &#145;cultural&#146; change where customary practices are perceived to negatively impact on the environment. Furthermore, current forms of tourism in Papua New Guinea do not help to support self defined images of Indigeneity, but rather promote images of Papua New Guineans as &#145;traditional&#146; and close to nature. The impetus for my investigation stems from Indigenous groups having identified their customary practices and distinct cultural identities as something to be proud of and worthy of maintaining. It is therefore vital to understand forms of tourism &#145;development&#146; that may adversely impact upon them. Throughout my study, I conducted library and field research (in West New Britain province, Walindi, Kimbe and Buvussi areas), which involved interviews, conversations, participant observation, and questionnaires. I reviewed and critiqued relevant literature, including the works of Foucault (2002), Nash (1996), McClaurin (2001) Mowforth and Munt (1998), and Whorf (1956). Nash&#146;s (1996) theory that tourism adheres to models of imperialism proved to be applicable. Tourist marketing reinforces stereotypes of Indigenous groups, exoticising and homogenising the people. Stereotypes not only give tourists an idea of what Papua New Guineans are like, but are also reflected in the attitudes to and social interactions between tourists, guests and locals. Stereotypes occasionally added to preconceived notions of &#145;race&#146;, as evident in the words and actions of some tourists I interviewed and which were contradictory to the self image of many Indigenous peoples. Yet many tourists visit West New Britain for the sole purpose of diving, and are not interested in experiencing more than a superficial dose of culture, despite their preconceived ideas about it. Furthermore, current tourism in the New Guinea Islands prioritises conservation over cultural practices. I argue that in order for tourism to be used to reinforce constructions of Indigenous identities, recognition needs to be given to &#145;race&#146; and gender issues within the tourism industry. Education of locals, staff and guests that destabilises the colonialist structure of relationships within tourism, and supports local identities is needed. Dual naming and the considered use of local languages could not only strengthen and raise the importance of local languages, but could also strengthen cross-cultural relationships. Further, documenting customary practices and accepting emerging customs as &#145;authentic&#146; practices could aid people&#146;s appreciation that no &#145;culture&#146; is static. Indigenous peoples need to take greater control of the tourism industry to enable local people and tourists to become more aware of the cultural impact of environmental conservation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158729</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE ECONOMIC ROLE OF FORMAL AND INFORMAL INTER-FIRM NETWORKS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SMALL AND MEDIUM INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES: STUDY OF SYMBIOSIS IN THE INDONESIAN GARMENT INDUSTRY</field><field name="creator">Adam, Latif</field><field name="description">It has been frequently argued that the formation of inter-firm networks (business cooperation) could be used as an effective means to promote SMIEs in Indonesia. However, as the majority of previous studies have concentrated largely on investigating SMIEs&#146; internal management, there has been only little detailed information available concerning the determinants and the economic role of inter-firm networks in the development of Indonesian SMIEs. This thesis discusses not only issues involving the development of SMIEs from the angle of SMIEs&#146; internal management, but also goes further to examine what are the determinants impacting on the efforts of SMIEs to develop and maintain long-term inter-firm networks, and to what extent and how have inter-firm networks contributed to the improvement in their performance. Thus, this thesis is expected to make several distinctive contributions to knowledge since it provides the first examination of the determinants and the economic role of inter-firm networks in the development of SMIEs in the Bandung garment industry, and is the first estimate of technological capabilities, competitiveness, and growth of SMIEs in Indonesia. To provide a better foundation for considering these three issues, this thesis starts by analyzing the development of both the Indonesian SMIEs and the Indonesian garment industry. Subsequently, this thesis constructs a theoretical framework by adopting a pluralistic theoretical approach. The theoretical framework emphasizes the importance of trust and competency as fundamental determinants for cementing the formation and operation of a network. The framework also highlights several advantages that SMIEs can enjoy from their involvement in a particular type of inter-firm networks. Using these initial analyses and the theoretical framework as guidance, a case study is then conducted by surveying 210 SMIEs in the garment industry in several specific locations of Bandung. The analysis outlined in this thesis indicates the important role of SMIEs in the Indonesian economy. SMIEs are able not only to create employment and generate income for both household economies and the national economy, but importantly also to contribute to Indonesia&#146;s industrial exports. However, despite these important roles, the analysis of the survey (fieldwork) data also indicates that SMIEs suffer from a number of problems. It is found that most SMIEs surveyed face difficulties in securing and expanding their markets. They also have limited resources and access to capital, technology, and raw materials. The majority of SMIEs surveyed eased their problems by engaging in inter-firm networks. However, due to unfair practices, untrustworthy and incompetent partners, a significant number of them terminated and discontinued their engagement. Consistent with theoretical arguments, it is found that by developing inter-firm networks, SMIEs surveyed have an alternative solution to securing and expanding their markets. Furthermore, developing inter-firm networks provides opportunities to SMIEs to have better access to capital, technology, information, and raw materials. This suggests that inter-firm networks can be used as an important means of facilitating the development of SMIEs. Three important conditions may facilitate the preference of the majority of SMIEs surveyed to develop inter-firm networks. Firstly, entrepreneurs in the Bandung garment industry come from a similar socio-cultural background. Furthermore, Bandung&#146;s garment products are popular among many Indonesian for their up-to-date design, good quality, and competitive prices. This popularity attracts many enterprises from Bandung and other Indonesian cities to develop networks with Bandung&#146;s garment enterprises. In addition, by using a binomial logit model, it is found that several attributes of entrepreneurs, particularly educational background, correlate positively with the decision of SMIEs to develop inter-firm networks. The higher educational level of entrepreneurs, the more likely they are to develop inter-firm networks. The fact that the majority of entrepreneurs interviewed have a high level of educational background could be another reason why inter-firm networks have been adopted as a common strategy by the majority of SMIEs surveyed. This is because educational background correlates positively with the ability to build contacts and to communicate with others. The better entrepreneurs communicate with others, the more capable they are to develop inter-firm networks. In line with the theoretical argument, the analysis of the fieldwork data also indicates that trustworthiness and competency are fundamental determinants for the success of long-term inter-firm networks. Thus, to develop such networks, SMIEs need not only to build trust and competency, but also to find trustworthy and competent partners. This entailed several initial mechanisms being utilized by the SMIEs surveyed. Interestingly, the initial mechanism that SMIEs choose to develop inter-firm networks determines whether or not their networks can survive over a longer period of time. Indeed, as the estimates of the binomial logit model indicates, if entrepreneurs develop cooperation through mechanisms other than trade and industry associations and government programs, this increases the probability of long-term business cooperation. In contrast, if entrepreneurs develop business cooperation via trade and industry associations and government programs, this decreases the probability that cooperation will continue over a longer period of time. By using an ordered probit model, the analyses of the survey data also shows that inter-firm networks, together with several other variables, positively influence the performances of SMIEs surveyed. If SMIEs are involved in inter-firm networks, this increases their probability of improving their technological capabilities, expanding their markets, and accelerating their growth. However, the estimates of the ordered probit model also indicate that each type of inter-firm network brings a different positive impact. Engaging in more than one type of inter-firm network has a larger impact on improving the performances of SMIEs surveyed than involvement in one type of network. Also, entering a vertical inter-firm network (putting out and subcontracting) has a greater positive impact in enabling SMIEs to increase their business performances than entering into horizontal inter-firm network (clustering). The significant role of inter-firm networks in providing various benefits for SMIEs may in turn encourage the government to become involved in the promotion of inter-firm networks. However, by assuming SMIEs that can maintain their inter-firm networks over a longer period of time are those that succeed in developing their networks, it is found that such networks can only be developed successfully if they are based on economic and profit motivations. This suggests that the government should focus and limit its involvement in the promotion of inter-firm networks by only adopting market-oriented policy based on actual needs as articulated by SMIEs themselves. Indeed, as the SMIEs surveyed mention, instead of intervening directly, the government should pay more attention to the creation of conducive and stable legal and commercial (economic) conditions. Many SMIEs believe that such an environment is an important prerequisite not only to stimulate the development of inter-firm networks, but also to ensure that these work effectively. Without having to intervene directly, there are many ways in which the government can support the development of inter-firm networks. The first important one is to design and introduce a legal framework (laws) that can be used to solve commercial disputes of firms in a network. In addition, the government could eliminate various nuisance taxes and reduce tariffs and taxes on high quality imported inputs to enable SMIEs to develop inter-firm networks. Finally, the government should eliminate discriminatory policy against SMIEs and implement anti-monopoly laws to ensure that SMIEs and LIEs compete fairly.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158730</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING OF THE CERVICAL EXTENSOR MUSCULATURE IN PERSISTENT WHIPLASH ASSOCIATED DISORDERS (WAD): RELATIONSHIP WITH SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF CHRONIC WAD</field><field name="creator">Elliott, James</field><field name="description">Ongoing pain and disability is not uncommon in 20-60% of persons following a whiplash injury. A number of causes for symptom persistence have been suggested, but current diagnostic imaging techniques have not clearly identified pathoanatomical causes. As a result, there continues to be long-standing acrimony about whether persistent pain is attributable to a salient structural physical pathology or to other underlying processes. Nevertheless qualitative observations have been made on MRI of fatty infiltrate in the sub-occipital extensor muscles in chronic neck disorders and these have been aligned with a decrease in standing balance and EMG abnormalities in the rectus capitis posterior minor muscles reasoned to be related to a denervation of the C1 dorsal ramus. However there has been no systematic quantitative evaluation of the presence of fatty infiltrate in the extensor muscles in chronic whiplash and no detailed study of the relationship of any fatty infiltrate to symptomatic and physical features. The aim of this thesis was to establish a MRI measure to quantify muscle/fat constituents in cervical extensor muscles as well as to investigate any relationship between musculature degeneration (fatty infiltrate, atrophy) and sensory, physical or psychological features in female subjects with chronic whiplash associated disorders (WAD). This thesis reports a series of studies which make up this body of research. A conventional MRI measure was developed to analyze signal intensities for cervical extensor muscular fat content. Clinical tests which have shown to characterize the chronic condition were also examined: thermal and pressure pain thresholds, cervical range of movement (ROM), joint position error (JPE), and questionnaires of self-reported pain and disability (neck disability index (NDI); dizziness handicap inventory (DHI)); general well being (general health questionnaire (GHQ-28), Short-Form-36 (SF-36) and psychological stress (Impact Events Scale (IES); Tampa Scale of Kinesophobia (TSK) were collected. Comparison was made between 79 female subjects, aged 18-45 years with chronic WAD and 34 healthy female controls of similar ages. A final study was conducted in which subjects with chronic insidious onset neck pain were examined to assess whether the findings of fatty infiltrate were peculiar to chronic WAD or were generic to chronic neck pain disorders. The outcomes of the studies present the development of a reliable MRI measure for cervical muscle/fat constituents as well as muscle morphometry. It was determined that age, body mass index and activity levels did not influence muscular alterations in both asymptomatic and symptomatic subjects. Physical, sensory, motor and psychological impairments were found in subjects with chronic WAD but not in healthy controls or insidious onset neck pain. The presence of muscular degeneration was identified in subjects with chronic WAD. It was widespread involving all extensor muscles, but higher indices of fatty infiltrate were found in the sub-occipital and multifidus muscles, especially at the C3 level. Nevertheless the fatty infiltrate was not strongly related to clinical features, with only marginal relationships being observed between cervical ROM, JPE, thermal/pressure thresholds and psychological stress. Nevertheless all of the WAD subjects demonstrated widespread fatty infiltrate in combination with impairments that typically characterize the chronic condition, suggesting that chronic WAD represents a complex, debilitated state. Widespread fatty infiltrate was not found in subjects with insidious onset neck pain, suggesting this is a feature characteristic of WAD. The mechanisms for the development of fatty infiltrate in chronic WAD could not be determined from this thesis but its presence underpins the need to further utilize advanced MRI techniques to better determine the origin behind these changes. This research is a vital step forward towards a more accurate identification and diagnosis for those who continue to suffer in the long-term following a whiplash injury. Future research should include a more heterogenous sample of whiplash subjects to determine if fatty infiltrate is unique to those with chronic symptoms or a general feature of the condition regardless of recovery. It is also imperative to conduct a longitudinal study to establish the temporal development of fatty infiltrate following whiplash and these studies should include male subjects to determine gender differences. Early recognition of these muscular changes in tandem with clinical tests may ultimately assist in the diagnosis and hence contribute towards the development of treatments aimed at lessening the transition from acute to chronic pain following whiplash injury.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158731</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond the Visible: Disability and Performing Bodies</field><field name="creator">McHenry, Lalita</field><field name="description">This thesis emerges from my work in the disability field and engagement in disability arts. After attending the first High Beam Festival in Adelaide in 1998, I became interested in the ways that disabled bodies were reclaiming identity and performing issues about disability as a challenge to those offered through dominant cultural representations. Work in the disability field over the past 50 years that has been dominated by medical and social frameworks, but disability studies and creative works by people with disabilities are shifting the focus and insisting on the centrality, rather than marginality, of the disabled body&#151;arguing for a new cultural space. These cultural practices are witness to the reconstruction, transformation and subversion of the discourses that historically circumscribe disability. Common to much disability arts practice is a desire to make visible a repressed and &#145;othered&#146; body, rewrite the scripts of disability by drawing on the real experience of people with disabilities and, perhaps most importantly, to provoke a rethinking of disability (primarily in the able-bodied majority) by reversing the gaze. Despite these efforts, disability continues to exist in an untenable binary with the able-bodied. In addition, questions of subjectivity and embodiment beyond the purview of physical and visible disability remain under-explored. This has led to a broader interest in a politics of the image and an analysis of the normative gaze, issues this thesis places under considerable scrutiny. As the title of this thesis indicates, I ask questions that go beyond the visible by exploring disability and performing bodies. At the forefront of this enquiry is a concern with the relations of looking, the nature of Otherness and questions of the gaze. The research is conducted through observation of live performance, in-depth interviews with disabled performers, theatre producers and artists, and a detailed analysis of the processes involved. Questions of the body are at the heart of numerous disciplines including feminism, disability studies, cultural studies, postcolonial and performance studies. The body can be said to be under a radical deconstructive agenda. The thought that theatre reflects an unproblematic reality no longer holds true because the performer&#146;s self is not just a question of assuming a character or playing a role. What then of work that relies on these tropes as important markers of cultural resistance? I introduce the important developments in the field of disability and performance and address a series of research questions: In what ways can the cultural sphere of the arts work as a site of intervention able to respond to the problems of extant constructions of disability? How might disability be performed in ways that address issues of exclusion and abjection and at the same time avoid perpetuating the very oppressive spaces that are under challenge? What are the limitations of a pure visibility politics? What are the ideological interpellations and emotional and political effects of performing in a disability arts context? What might be gained from problematising the disabled body itself? In this thesis, I bring together a number of divergent cultural sites through which to challenge the concept of disability and the performing disabled body. These cultural sites include disability arts theory and practice, live performance, contemporary freak shows and the practices of self-demand amputation and extreme body modification. These sites provoke an examination of subjectivity and a rethinking of how disability and the disabled subject are presently understood. It is necessary to deconstruct the disabled subject and rethink notions of the Other in order to provoke any real challenge to the discourses of perfection and wholeness that dominate the cultural imaginary. The term Other is generally used in disability theory in ways that inevitably resort to a binary relationship and a problematic understanding of the operations of the gaze. In the work of both Emmanuel Levinas and Jacques Lacan, the term Other dramatically shifts in meaning and offers a profound rethinking of the premises of much disability theory and arts practice. Levinas&#146;s work offers the possibility for an alternative ethics of performance for an audience and a different way of thinking about the relations between self and other and disability. Lacan&#146;s work on the Other and the gaze assists in unpacking the binary distinctions often constructed in the visual field between notions of the normal observer and the disabled subject. I endeavour to move beyond visibility, to highlight the limitations of a politics steeped in mobilising a disabled subject and identity without eclipsing the significance of the visual in the formation of subjectivity. By engaging with a few select performances and other cultural projects not currently read through the lens of disability, yet corporeally linked to questions about body image, the Other and desire my hope is that a more critical perspective on the concept of disability can be adopted. This provides the conditions to further the development of a critical disability studies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158732</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of the Host Immune Response in Cystic Fibrosis Mice</field><field name="creator">Palmer, James</field><field name="description">Lung disease is the major cause of mortality in cystic fibrosis patients. Lack of functional cystic fibrosis conductance transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in airway epithelia alters the environment of the lung, predisposing patients to chronic infections predominated by the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Such infections cause an exaggerated host inflammatory response characterised by a sustained neutrophilic influx which ultimately destroys the lung tissue resulting in respiratory failure. In addition to the inability for CF patients to effectively clear airway infections evidence exists suggesting an innate defect in inflammatory signalling pathways due to a lack of CFTR, priming the CF lung for a heightened state of inflammation even in the absence of detectable infection. In order to develop effective strategies for dealing with CF lung disease a greater understanding is required of the dysregulation in the molecular signalling pathways that leads to the uncontrolled state of inflammation in the CF lung. The G551D CF mouse previously generated in our laboratory exhibits characteristic CF phenotypes including altered chloride conduction in the airways, reduced ability for bacterial clearance and a dysregulated lung inflammatory response upon bacterial challenge. The work presented in this study further characterises the response in these animals upon stimulation with an intratracheal dose of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This treatment regime was sufficient to initiate an acute inflammatory response in the lungs of both WT and CF mice, from which animals of both genotypes routinely recovered. G551D animals consistently lost a greater amount of weight than their WT counterparts and exhibited enhanced recruitment of inflammatory cells, predominantly neutrophils, to the lungs. To profile transcriptional responses occurring in the lung after exposure to inflammatory stimulus both CF and WT animals were treated with LPS and sacrificed six hours post-treatment. Six hours marks a point where no discernable difference existed between the two genotypes, as measured by cellular infiltrate and cytokine levels in the airways. cDNA and oligonucleotide microarrays were utilised to determine relative differences in transcriptional activity between CF and WT mice. A series of comparisons was performed to incorporate potential differences in gene expression levels between the genotypes in the absence of stimulus. A robust transcriptional response was detected in both WT and CF animals in response to LPS. The majority of genes were similarly regulated in both genotypes, leaving overall levels of transcript comparable after stimulus. Similarly, few differences were detected between CF and WT mice not exposed to LPS. Analysis of microarrays directly comparing transcript levels in the lungs of WT and CF mice exposed to LPS revealed a number of genes expressed at lower levels in the CF samples which shared the common feature of being known targets of interferon signalling. Independent validation of a series of molecules integral to interferon beta signalling confirmed genes downstream of interferon beta, namely Stat1, Irf7 and Tap2, were consistently expressed at lower levels in the CF lung compared to WT after exposure to LPS. While all three of these genes were transcriptionally upregulated by LPS in both genotypes the response was diminished in the CF lung. Whether or not this perturbation in signalling stems from a deficiency in production of interferon beta itself or is a result of impaired downstream events remains to be elucidated. Nevertheless, with increasing evidence promoting interferon beta as an important molecule in inflammatory regulation the data presented in this thesis suggests this as a worthy point of intervention in managing the persistent deleterious effects associated with CF lung disease.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158733</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CODESWITCHING IN INDONESIAN ISLAMIC RELIGIOUS DISCOURSE: A SOCIOLINGUISTIC PERSPECTIVE</field><field name="creator">Susanto, Djoko</field><field name="description">This study examines the reasons for codeswitching among Indonesian, Javanese and Arabic in religious meetings, called musyawarah, held by the members of an Indonesian Islamic Da&#146;wah Association (IIDA) in Malang, East Java, Indonesia. The study is based on the collection and analysis of 13 hours of recording of naturally occurring conversational data, which reflect issues central to the social and religious life of this community. In this context, codeswitching is examined to understand why it occurs, and what it tells us about the social and linguistic interactions occurring in this community. As a basis for understanding codeswitching, this study draws on sociolinguistic perspectives to analyse the data, including the Situational and Metaphorical approaches (Blom &amp; Gumperz, 1972), the Markedness Model (Myers-Scotton, 1993), and Politeness Theory (Brown &amp; Levinson, 1987). To collect the data for the present study, observations, questionnaires and interviews were employed. This study finds that the reasons for codeswitching are influenced by situational and metaphorical factors. From the situational point of view, the reasons for codeswitching are influenced by such unmarked factors as participant, setting and topic. Among these factors, the participant plays the most important role influencing codeswitching to Javanese madya &#145;mid level&#146; and krama &#145;high level&#146;. Despite the fact that the participants come from a wide range of social backgrounds, and vary by age, level of education, wealth, occupation and status in society, within the IIDA community, however, the role of the participants is constrained only by particular social positions. Participants of higher social status, such as an imam, although he may be relatively young, will receive respectful treatment from the participants. This imam is respected not simply because of his age, but also because of his hierarchical position, and thus, requires the participants to use a polite language to respect the imam. This is also made possible by the fact that Javanese speakers consider empan &#145;material or topic&#146;, papan &#145;setting&#146; and adepan &#145;interlocutor&#146; as important Javanese norms before initiating a conversation. These factors affect whether a certain topic should be addressed to a certain person in a particular setting. In the present study, the decision to use a particular language or variety is determined not only by considering what language is used to whom, how and where, but also by taking into consideration for what aim. Thus, the reason for using Javanese krama (what language) to a younger imam (to whom), for example, is influenced not only by the fact that the participant is speaking to an imam, but more importantly it is also driven by the participant&#146;s understanding that using refined language to an imam will accrue religious merit. From the metaphorical point of view, the participants&#146; perception of switching to Javanese is to maintain individual relationships, such as (1) to express politeness, (2) to be more intimate, and (3) to show solidarity. Indonesian, however, is used when discussing topics pertaining to formality, such as a meeting. From the metaphorical perspective, Indonesian is used because the participants feel more confident and fluent than in Javanese krama or Arabic. In this case, Indonesian serves as an avoidance strategy, that is, to avoid using the Javanese honorifics due to speaker&#146;s insufficient Javanese ability. Indonesian is also used to maintain the personal distance from other participants, to feel more confident, and to create equality and neutrality. The participants admit that they use Arabic because they (1) need to convince the audience of the importance of their utterance, (2) need to emphasise what they say, (3) want to help others understand religious teachings, (4) cannot find a term which is equivalent in another language, (5) want to remind the audience that the musyawarah is a place of religious activities, and (6) more importantly they believe that the use of some Arabic expressions bring religious blessings. Overall, this finding confirms the hypothesis that codeswitching is used to express the participants&#146; unique combined worldview of the Islamic norms and Javanese cultures.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158734</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Everyday Authenticity: Contemporary Uses of the Diary</field><field name="creator">Cardell, Kylie</field><field name="description">This thesis examines how diary narrative authorises contemporary experiential claims. How does the diary genre connect to selected locations and contexts for self-fashioning or self-presentation now? The diary is a shifting and multiple autobiographical practice that emerges variously in text and electronic media&#151;it is not fixed but travels and assumes new forms. This thesis considers contemporary uses of diary in the context of therapy and self-help, journalism, testimony, and confession, through new and traditional media, and across a series of contexts including Australia, North America, Britain, and the Middle East. This thesis argues that across these various media and contexts, diary forms emerge strongly within a paradigm that privileges the eyewitness, the confessional and the individual and the construction and representation of authentic experience. This has particular consequences for the diary as a contemporary genre. The Introduction considers some key theoretical concepts for diary criticism and establishes a critical perspective. Here I foreground issues of genre, gender, and confession as well as discourses of authenticity and the everyday as central themes in the thesis. This discussion introduces the main argument, which is concerned with the locations and contexts for contemporary uses of diary. It establishes that diary is an important genre for contemporary self-representation and that it is a distinctive and powerful rhetorical device in contemporary life narrative. Chapter One examines the phenomenon of the &#145;how-to&#146; diary manual, or journal guidebook, an emerging genre that has gathered momentum in the last decade. Examining &#145;how-to diary&#146; texts by authors such as Sarah Ban Breathnach, Julia Cameron, Stephanie Dowrick, Ira Progoff, Tristine Rainer, and Michelle Weldon, the significance of the diary as a genre for authentic self-representation is analysed in this chapter. What are essentially &#145;self-help&#146; uses of diary by these authors draw on ideas of self and subjectivity that are both historical and shifting. In this chapter I explore how, and what, versions of the self are mobilised by contemporary howto authors. By turning to one of the most popular fictional diaries of recent times, Bridget Jones&#146;s Diary, I analyse a highly popular and particularly provocative playing out of the diary as a tool of self-knowledge and authenticity. Chapter Two examines a particularly fertile context for the production of life narrative: war. The war correspondents Thomas Goltz and Paul McGeough use diary to explore the ethics of reporting conflict and to account for the presence of western journalists in foreign war zones. Assumptions of the diary as an authentic genre can be strategic; in the context of war reportage, the diary is a rhetorical device that can tap into desires for immediate, authentic and personal representation. Chapter Three develops a different approach to diaries of war. The diaries of Nuha al-Radi, Riverbend and Suad Amiry foreground issues of gender and problems of place. This chapter considers how al-Radi, Riverbend and Amiry use diary to shape quotidian, domestic and personal representations of experience during war and conflict that intervene in stereotypical representations of Arab women in the Middle East Chapter Four turns to a new form for diary: the blog or online diary. New technologies enable new forms and new ways of knowing and representing the self, and the digital subject is of intense interest for diary scholars. The online diary is one venue in which ideas of authorship, authenticity and subjectivity are played out and contested in contemporary culture. The example of the personal sexblog that is the focus of the last part of this chapter draws attention to intimate and confessional disclosure as a feature, and expectation, of writing online. Sex bloggers like Belle de Jour or Abby Lee emphasise connections, both in form and content, to the traditional diary and they produce narratives that are highly popular and highly marketable. As a coda to this chapter I consider the emergence of the blog book, a production in which the sex diary has been a prominent feature, and a phenomenon that puts considerable pressure on expectations and assumptions that attend contemporary uses of the diary. The Conclusion takes us back to the foundational question for this thesis: what is the effect of diary as a genre for contemporary self representation?</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lamb wave diffraction tomography for imaging material inhomogeneities in isotropic plates</field><field name="creator">Rohde, Andrew</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the implementation and feasibility of Lamb wave diffraction tomography for digitally reconstructing flexural defects, i.e. those that do not produce any mode coupling, in structural plate components. The technique relies upon the damage been modelled as a pure flexural inhomogeneity and is well suited to low-levels of corrosion damage in metallic materials and barely visible impact damage in layered composites. Unlike previous Lamb wave imaging strategies, this approach explicitly includes the two-dimensional effects of wave diffraction, making it also more sensitive to damages that are comparable in size with the wavelengths of the interrogating field. This has typically been a problematic area for conventional nondestructive evaluation techniques as they often rely upon large damage severities for positive identification. Thus, diffraction tomography should be useful as a complimentary technique for the early detection and characterisation of low severity damage. The imaging is investigated both numerically and experimentally in three fundamental areas of quantitative nondestructive evaluation, viz. locating, sizing and quantifying the severity of a single damage on an otherwise undamaged plate. In the numerical studies, computer simulations of the wave-defect interaction are used to generate synthetic scatter data which are directly input into the imaging system. For this purpose, several modelling strategies that employ the analytical approximations of Mindlin plate theory are implemented and compared with experimental measurements for cylindrical damage geometries. The results demonstrate the usefulness of Mindlin's equations, as opposed to exact equations from three-dimensional elasticity, as an accurate and tractable framework for Lamb wave scattering problems. The simulations are also used to investigate the parametric sensitivities of wave-defect interactions, which are important for quantifying key experimental parameters in the first prototype imaging system, viz. minimum number of receivers, optimal actuator-damage-receiver configurations and interrogation pulse design for maximum signal-to-noise ratio. For the experimental investigations, various severities of manufactured damage on an aluminium plate are used to test the prototype imaging systems. Initially, damages are simulated by bonding small weights identically to both the upper and lower plate surfaces. This way the damages are symmetric about the plate mid-plane, which means that there shouldn't be any mode conversion in the scattering, i.e. a flexural incident wave gives rise to only flexural scattered waves. This is an important consideration for the feasibility studies as the analytical model used for the imaging does not account for mode coupling. Next, uniform reductions of plate thickness over a circular area are considered. These are also introduced identically to both sides of the plate. This type of damage is used as a first approximation to more realistic corrosion damage which, it is envisaged, will be one of the damage modes to be targeted by the technique. The results show that plate-wave diffraction tomography enables the quantitative reconstruction of location, size and severity of plate damage with excellent sensitivity. They also demonstrate the robustness of the technique for a variety of damage configurations, which sometimes do not exactly satisfy the underlying assumptions of the flexural inhomogeneity model. Thus, a fundamentally improved understanding of Lamb wave imaging for plate damage has been achieved. Apart from demonstrating the potential of diffraction tomography as an advanced quantitative nondestructive evaluation technique, the thesis also lays the foundation for future research on this topic, which will address the transition of the technique to realistic structures, e.g. curved panels, stiffened plates, sandwich structures, damages with mode conversion etc.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158736</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interfacial Heat Transfer in Die Casting of Light Alloys</field><field name="creator">Hamasaiid, Anwar</field><field name="description">In die casting, heat transfer is controlled by the properties of the casting-die interface, due to the high thermal diffusivity and conductivity of the die. Higher heat transfer rates result in higher productivity in the die casting process along with finer microstructure with superior part qualities. In die casting processes, the use of numerical simulation to predict the mould filling, solidification, and the distribution of temperature in the die has become an important development in foundry technology and cast product developments. The effectiveness of the simulation is dependent on the accuracy of the heat transfer data at the metal-mould boundary used in the simulation software. For these reasons, accurate knowledge about the heat transfer between the casting and the die during the die casting process has become an important issue for most researchers in this field. This investigation studies the interfacial heat transfer during the casting and solidification of light alloys in Gravity (GDC) and High Pressure (HPDC) Die Casting processes. Suitable experimental methods and sensors have been developed that enable the measurement of temperatures, in-cavity pressure and a range of process parameters. Heat Transfer Gauges have been manufactured, accurately calibrated and integrated into the dies for both investigated processes. These gauges measure the casting surface temperature with a pyrometric chain and the temperature through the die wall at different depths with very thin K-type thermocouples. Extensive industrial trials were performed using Al-7Si-0.3Mg, A-9Si- 3Cu and AZ91 D alloys. From the temperature measurements, the Heat Transfer Coefficient (HTC) and heat flux density (q) at the casting-die interface have been evaluated using an inverse method. The obtained results have been correlated with the process parameters and to the microstructure of the castings for some selected cases. In GDC, the results show that the applied coating on the die surface governs the heat transfer during solidification of the casting through its low effective thermal conductivity. The effective thermal conductivity of the coating is determined by the high level of porosity in its structure. For this reason, its chemical composition has a very limited influence on the peak value of heat transfer. However, the coating composition does influence the variation of the heat transfer coefficient with time during solidification. The variation of HTC at the castingdie interface has been divided into three main stages according to the conditions of contact during casting and solidification: liquid-solid, semisolid-solid and solid-solid contact. The HTC at each of these stages is dominated by different process parameters. A secondary peak in the evolution of the HTC has been observed at the end of the semisolid-solid stage. This secondary peak was attributed to the exudation of solute rich eutectic liquid onto the surface region of the casting enabling fresh liquid contact with the mould coating. In HPDC the value of the HTC is much larger than that determined in GDC ((105 Wm-2K-1 compared to103 Wm-2K-1 in GDC). The variation of HTC with time is also very rapid since the heat flux density is much greater than that in GDC. The rapid variation of the HTC is attributed to the degradation of contact between the casting and the die occurring during solidification. The second stage velocity and the impact pressure caused by the sudden deceleration of the piston as the cavity was filled have a significant influence on the interfacial heat transfer during HPDC. This impact pressure is different from the intensification pressure which is applied during the third stage of the casting process. The values of the peak heat transfer coefficient showed no dependence on intensification pressure in our trials. Analytical models have been developed to predict the thermal contact resistance (TCR) at the liquid-solid interface in general. Contact topography and interface characteristics are included in the model through die surface roughness and the mean trapped air layer between the casting and the die. The mean trapped air layer is determined from the mechanisms of contact at the liquid-solid interface. Two different contact mechanisms have been considered; liquid-porous solid and liquid-non porous solid contact. In the liquid-non porous case, the air is trapped and compressed inside the microcavities. However, when the solid surface is porous, the air is not trapped and can escape through the pores. In this situation, the contact conditions are determined by the pressure, surface tension of the liquid and the surface roughness characteristics of the die or coating. The proposed models determine the radius and the density of the microcontact points for a given condition of contact. The density and the radius of contact spots have been integrated into a classical thermal flux tube theory in order to calculate HTC at the casting-die interface. The models have been applied to the casting-die interface in GDC and HPDC. The calculated TCR is found to agree well with the experimentally determined results. The models provide valuable information about the role of the casting-die interface in heat transfer during GDC and HPDC processes. The results show that the effect of the measured parameters such as pressure and roughness on the HTC at the casting-die depends on the mechanisms of contact. For HPDC, the evolution of the HTC with time has been associated with the presence of a rapidly solidified region on the casting surface which forms early during solidification due to the high thermal gradient. However, in GDC the relatively low thermal gradients are associated with microstructures more consistent with the formation of a mushy zone across the casting.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158737</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of the Taxonomy and Ecology of the Oscillatoriales (Cyanoprokaryota) of North- Eastern Australia</field><field name="creator">McGregor, Glenn</field><field name="description">The cyanoprokaryota is a morphologically diverse group of prokaryotes, known to occur in almost all biotopes where they provide a significant contribution to the primary productivity of most aquatic ecosystems and indeed the biosphere. Despite their importance, there are very few comprehensive regional accounts of cyanoprokaryote biodiversity in the scientific literature, particularly from Australia&#146;s tropical regions and niches including benthic and extreme environments. In terms of morphological and molecular data, one particularly understudied section of the cyanoprokaryota is the Oscillatoriales. The representatives of this group which contains the simplest, most diversified and most variable cyanoprokaryotes without heterocytes and akinetes. They are differentiated by features, which vary with environmental and culture conditions and as such may not be phylogenetically informative. This project addresses the paucity of floristic and ecological information on Australia&#146;s freshwater cyanoprokaryota (cyanobacteria) by investigating the relatively neglected yet ecologically significant order, the Oscillatoriales. The project has four major foci. Representatives of the Oscillatoriales are known from most biotopes, however their relationships to environmental conditions and their relative contribution to total microfloral diversity in a number of habitats is poorly understood. Similarly there have been relatively few studies published on the microfloral communities of Australian river systems and their relationship to environmental conditions and none of these have simultaneously measured the compositional structure of both planktonic and benthic littoral community assemblages, or compared influences on community structure at multiple scales. A study of the microfloral assemblages of two Australian dryland river systems was conducted comparing Cooper Creek, Lake Eyre Basin, and the Warrego River, Murray&#150;Darling Basin. How algal biodiversity is partitioned across the landscape was explored and whether variation is greater spatially or temporally was examined. Despite the waterholes studied having characteristically high levels of abiogenic turbidity, a total of 186 planktonic microalgae, 253 benthic diatom and 62 macroalgal species were recorded. The phytoplankton communities were dominated by flagellated cryptophytes, euglenophytes and chlorophytes, the diatom communities by cosmopolitan taxa known to tolerate wide environmental conditions, and the macroalgal communities by filamentous cyanobacteria. In general the assemblage patterns were poorly correlated with the measured environmental variables. Phytoplankton and diatom assemblage patterns were weakly correlated with several waterhole geomorphic measures, whereas macroalgal assemblage patterns showed some association with variability in ionic concentration. The benthic freshwater cyanoprokaryote, Lyngbya wollei (Farlow ex Gomont) Speziale and Dyck is a known producer of the potent neurotoxic saxitoxins in the southern United States where it is regarded as a nuisance species. A morphological, ecological and toxicological evaluation was conducted on two south-east Queensland populations of L. wollei to investigate the similarities of this species with those reported in the literature from the northern hemisphere. We found that both populations produced the potent cyanotoxin cylindrospermopsin (CYN) and deoxy-cylindrospermopsin (deoxy- CYN). This is the first report of the production of CYN and deoxy-CYN by L. wollei or any species of the Oscillatoriales. Extensive surveys of all representative freshwater biotopes in north-eastern Australia were conducted, collecting new material for taxonomic determination. Using a morphometric and ecological approach, existing Australian records and new collections were re-evaluated in light of recent nomenclatural changes. Taxonomic descriptions, original illustrations, photomicrographs, and keys were developed to facilitate their identification. The resulting volume provides a phenotypic baseline for the identification of field populations of the non-heterocystous, filamentous cyanoprokaryotes from north-eastern Australia. This phenotypic and ecological characterisation of natural populations is necessary to further both ecological and systematic research. It is currently the only practical method for widespread recognition of cyanoprokaryote diversity from different regions and is the first methodological step towards a polyphasic evaluation. Of the 122 taxa from north-eastern Australia discussed, three are described as new species following the requirements of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. Cyanoprokaryote composition of microbial mats from an alkaline thermal spring from tropical north-eastern Australia was assessed. A polyphasic approach was used which included phenotypic observation of morphological and ultrastructural features, and genotypic analysis using partial 16S-rRNA sequences. Two distinct mat structures were recognisable: flat horizontally spreading mats, and mats comprised of densely arranged, non-lithified gelatinous tentaculiform towers. This tentaculiform mat type dominated the site. Eight genera and ten species from three cyanobacterial orders were identified based on morphological characters. These represented taxa previously known as thermophiles from other continents. Two filamentous morphotypes which formed the majority of the biomass of the towers had ultrastructural characteristics of the family Pseudanabaenaceae with 4 &#150; 6 parietal thylakoids arranged concentrically and parallel to the cell wall, and type B cell division. DNA extracts were made from sections of the tentaculiform towers and the microbial community analysed by 16S cyanobacteriaspecific PCR and denaturing-gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Individual bands were excised from the gel and sequencing demonstrated five significant bands. Collectively they were related to a number of cyanobacteria from thermal habitats. Generally the morphological/ultrastructural characteristics aligned with the molecular classification, however the dominant Leptolyngbya morphotype was shown to cluster closely with Oscillatoria amphigranulata, isolated from New Zealand hot springs, and the sub-dominant Leptolyngbya was a unique phylotype with only moderate similarity (96%) to a range of Leptolyngbya from Greenland. This is the first polyphasic evaluation of thermophilic cyanobacterial communities from the Australian continent.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158738</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Arsenic speciation of mine wastes for risk assessment</field><field name="creator">Matanitobua, Vitukawalu Peceli</field><field name="description">To assist mining companies in their attempts to rehabilitate land and waters used for, and impacted by, their activities, there is a need to study the occurrence, distribution, and speciation of metals and metalloids associated with mining. Furthermore, there is a need to provide credible estimations of the likely bioavailability of the specific forms of the metals/metalloids found to be present, to form the basis of a risk assessment of the potential of the metal/metalloid to cause toxicological damage. The work described in this thesis deals with arsenic speciation on solid and aqueous samples collected in areas associated with mining sites, and upon the ability of these samples to adsorb further arsenic, and to be adsorbed by naturally occurring iron minerals. It also extends the concept of risk assessment by undertaking work aimed at assessing bioavailability of species of arsenic shown to occur within the samples. Arsenic speciation in the solid phase has traditionally been difficult, and as a result different selective extraction techniques have been used to attempt to define various arsenic species. In this work such extractions have been done, and the results obtained compared with speciation using X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS) Spectroscopy applying the related XAFS techniques of X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) Spectroscopy and the Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) Spectroscopy. The two analysis techniques are related, but they provide slightly different information about an element&#146;s (in this case arsenic&#146;s) local coordination and chemical state. The oxidation states and the ratio of arsenic species present in powdered samples and their respective sequentially extracted fractions were determined. It is shown that X-ray spectroscopy is a far superior tool for defining arsenic speciation than is sequential extraction; whereas the former approach unequivocally defines actual chemical forms of arsenic, the latter method yields very misleading results regarding the actual arsenic species extracted in each step. There is effectively no correlation between results obtained by the two approaches. The only major drawbacks to X-ray spectroscopy approach are its cost and availability. XANES analysis of mine wastes indicates that As(V), comprising the arsenates of iron (28 %), calcium (25 %), and aluminium (23 %), is the dominant oxidation state in various mine waste samples including those dispersed as creek/river sediments. But mixed oxidation states of As(V), As(III) (consisting of sodium arsenite and arsenic sulfide), and As(-I) (consisting of arsenopyrite) were also observed to be present in some of the mine waste samples and their respective selective extraction fractions. The adsorption model of arsenic on dispersed creek/river sediments was also studied and ferrihydrite and goethite were identified as key iron oxyhydroxides for the adsorption of arsenic in creek sediments receiving tailings waters. XANES analysis revealed the presence of both As(V) and As(III) in the resulting sediment samples, with arsenic in the As(V) form dominant. The importance of bioavailability (BA) of a particular element is basic to any risk assessment, where BA refers to the ratio of the element absorbed compared to the amount ingested in the material in question. Traditionally, in the absence of specific BA data, this is assumed to be 100%. Experiments utilising the rat as an in-vivo model were undertaken in order to quantify the absolute bioavailability (ABA) of arsenic in mine waste samples (tailings and sediments); they showed that the ABA of contaminants varies between sites and the matrix of the sample. The total As(V) and As(III) ABA values for mine tailing and sediments samples fell in the range 6 to 32 %, with As(III) being invariably much more bioaccessible than As(V). It is clearly demonstrated that assuming 100% bioavailability of arsenic from soils and mine waste materials overestimates the risk associated with human exposure. Recent work has developed the concept of BA by use of an in-vitro physiologicallybased extraction test (PBET) to yield measurements of bioaccessibility (BAc). The PBET aims to simulate human uptake of the target element, and expresses BAc as uptake in terms of a percentage of available element. Assessment of BAc of some mine waste materials (tailing and sediments) dosed to animals to obtain ABA values was undertaken, and comparison made between BAc and ABA results. The BAc for the mine tailings samples ranged from 2.2 &#177; 0.1 to 11.5 &#177; 0.1 %, while river sediment samples were roughly 10 % of these values. When comparisons were made between the results obtained for bioavailability of arsenic in samples examined by the in vivo absolute bioavailability (ABA) method and the in vitro bioaccessibility (BAc) method, no correlation could be found in results obtained for any one of the tailing or sediment samples. Furthermore, the in vivo results indicate much higher values of ABA for As(III) than As(V), while the in vitro approach found that nearly all bioavailable arsenic is present as As(V); As(III) BA was negligible.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Necropsy-based Study of Green Turtles (Chelonia mydas) in South-East Queensland</field><field name="creator">Gordon, Anita Nancy</field><field name="description">Causes of morbidity and mortality were investigated for 108 green turtles (Chelonia mydas) stranded in south-east Queensland between 1990 and 1996. This study was undertaken as part of a broader carcass salvage program for south Queensland, and within the context of a population study of C. mydas in the Moreton Bay feeding ground. Accurate pathological characterisation of disease in C. mydas was achieved by detailed necropsy and histological examination. Varied inflammatory responses and degenerative changes were observed in stranded C. mydas. Supportive disciplines of microbiology, parasitology, and clinical chemistry were used to elucidate aetiology and pathogenesis of selected conditions. Heavy metal and pesticide levels were assessed in a sub-sample of turtles. Direct anthropogenic causes (including trauma, foreign body ingestion and drowning) accounted for 34% of mortalities of C. mydas in this study. The majority of the trauma cases were turtles with skull fractures resulting from blunt impacts. The remainder had boat propeller injuries, or miscellaneous trauma. Almost half of the turtles with lethal boat propeller damage had evidence of pre-existing disease which may well have predisposed them to boat strike, emphasising the importance of full necropsy examination, even when the cause of death appears obvious. Fishing line was the only ingested foreign body consistently implicated in the production of fatal intestinal obstruction. Marine turtle fibropapillomatosis, a panzootic viral disease which is considered to involve some indirect anthropogenic factors, accounted for 7% of mortalities. The findings in this study were consistent with much of the previously described pathology of this condition. Naturally-occurring diseases (for which human influences are unknown) accounted for the remaining 59% of strandings. Coccidiosis, caused by Caryospora cheloniae, was recorded for the first time in wild C. mydas. It occurred both as an epizootic (in 1991) and as sporadic cases. A variety of manifestations, including disseminated and enteric forms, were recognised. Infection with a Cryptosporidium-like protozoan appeared to occur concurrently with coccidiosis in one turtle in this study. Attempts to establish experimental coccidial infections in hatchling C. mydas were unsuccessful. Infections with cardiovascular (spirorchid) flukes were almost universal in stranded C. mydas in this study. They ranged from mild, incidental findings (such as occasional fluke egg granulomas evident microscopically in otherwise normal tissues) to a variety of severe changes, including thrombosis, which were likely to have produced morbidity. The present study clarified the range of cardiovascular lesions associated with spirorchidiasis, including the sequence of thrombus resolution and exteriorisation from vessels. In some cases spirorchid vasculitis was associated with fatal disseminated bacterial infections. Other sporadic, naturally-occurring diseases included mycotic pneumonia, bacterial meningoencephalitis and a miscellany of gastrointestinal conditions, including chronic intestinal tympany and obstipation, for which the underlying cause could not always be determined. Evidence indicated that gastrointestinal motility in C. mydas was prone to both direct and indirect disturbance and that tympany and obstipation could be final common outcomes of a range of insults. Eighteen abnormally buoyant turtles were examined during this study. The cause could usually be ascribed to an underlying disease, including (in decreasing order of frequency) trapped internal gas, usually intestinal; neurological disease such as traumatic brain injuries; and pulmonary disease. In two cases, no underlying cause was detected. Trace metal (arsenic, cadmium, mercury, selenium and zinc) concentrations were determined in the livers and kidneys of 50 turtles of mixed species (mostly C. mydas). These results were considered to provide baseline data for sea turtles in SE Qld. This study offered the largest dataset available for some metals in C. mydas, and provided evidence of high background levels of cadmium as a normal feature for the species. Some unusual age&#150;related trends in metal accumulation were detected. Concentrations of cadmium, zinc and selenium in the kidney decreased with increasing age, whereas zinc concentrations in the liver tended to increase. Determining the impact of disease on wildlife populations is an increasingly necessary task, which will require multidisciplinary teams. Necropsy surveys like the present study are an essential component of the growing field of conservation medicine. In addition to providing data relevant to management, such as the relative proportions of anthropogenic and naturally-occurring mortalities, necropsy surveys can identify a range of endemic pathogens, and help to collect prevalence data for determining disease impacts at the population level.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158740</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Influence of Multiple Cues on Attentional Capture</field><field name="creator">Carroll, Michael</field><field name="description">Laboratory-based research into understanding how the capture of visual attentional occurs has been restricted by how representative test stimuli are of real-world visual events. While visual scenes nearly always contain multiple potential attention-capturing stimuli, empirical research utilising a cuing task has generally examined attentional capture by only single cues. To address this shortcoming, and to progress visual attentional capture research closer to representing real-world visual events, the experimental series of this thesis was conducted with the focus being the examination of the influence (if any) of multiple element stimuli on visual attentional capture. Four sets of experiments were conducted, based upon the established Folk, Remington, and Johnston (1992) visual cuing paradigm, with the central thesis focusing on the influence of featurally defined and manipulated multiple (dual) element cues on visual attentional capture. The cuing paradigm approach was selected owing to its capacity to present multipleelement featurally defined capture stimuli of interest that were temporally separate from feature-defined task targets. While both of these display components were presented within the same trial, the capture stimuli appeared on their own just prior to target exposure. Separate presentation of these trial components allowed a clear distinction between involuntary attentional capture events and the voluntary target identification task. The featural manipulation capacity of the approach also allowed establishment and examination of artificial (i.e., laboratory-based) featural attentional sets, giving the &#147;multiple element&#148; focus of this thesis the potential to help resolve debate regarding the contribution of top-down versus bottom-up processes in visual capture events. Collectively, the experiments produced three main conclusions relating to the visual attentional capture process: (1) Multiple-element stimuli viewed within a scene captured attention differently from lone-element stimuli; (2) The relative salience of the components of those stimuli, with respect to each other and to other sources of visual information within the scene, strongly influenced capture outcomes; (3) Scene complexity that was heightened, whether by multiple stimuli or stimulus types, was more likely to see top-down involvement imparting an influence. These conclusions are discussed in the context of this thesis, and with regards to their relevance to current visual attentional capture understanding. Experimental and interpretational limitations are considered, followed by recommendations for expansion of this research approach into further laboratory-based examinations, and into applied visual attention capturing scenarios.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158741</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bourdieuan Analysis of Contemporary Principal Leadership Practice: An Interview Study of Queensland Secondary School Principals</field><field name="creator">Addison, Bruce</field><field name="description">This thesis presents and explains a range of forces impacting on the contemporary work environments of a sample of Queensland principals. Based on my informal observation that the concept of secondary school principalship had changed significantly since I commenced teaching in 1991, I set out to investigate this observation more thoroughly. From a basis in economics and political economy, I reviewed literature relating to neo-liberalism and the corporatisation of organizations, to provide insights into the complexity of the operating environments of principals. This was linked to a reading of the literature on educational change, where modernism/postmodernism provided a valuable prism. The vast array of literature on contemporary leadership theory also provided a means by which to view the complexity associated with contemporary school principalship. The literature reviewed thus enabled the thesis to draw linkages between neo-liberal economic thought, educational change and leadership theory. To investigate the working conditions of principals and their experiences (or not) of change, I interviewed all of the principals of the Grammar Schools of Queensland operating under the aegis of the Grammar Schools Act 1975 (Qld). The study was subsequently extended to include a convenience sample of Queensland State High School principals. These two groups of principals provided a contrasting array of data from which to understand the nature of contemporary principal practice. The two sectors were not treated as a binary, but were used to generate a deeper appreciation of contemporary principal practice than would have been provided by studying one sector alone. My positioning as both a product and an employee of the independent school sector provided me, from the outset of the research process, with a privileged knowledge of the worldviews and perspectives of independent school principals. Every care was taken not to allow this to interfere with the way in which the study was designed, executed and analysed. The analysis of interview data draws heavily on Bourdieu&#146;s thinking tools, particularly his work on habitus, field and capital. What I was to find was that the forces impacting on contemporary principal practice proved to be much greater than the idiosyncrasies of any one principal or any one school. The forces at work were global as well as local and they were layered and far from linear. These forces emanated from both the economic field and the field of schools and needed to be considered as a whole if the principal leadership of schools was to be fully appreciated. While the personality of any given principal was of importance to their concept of principalship, there were many economic, social, historical as well as educational forces at work. The Grammar School principals appeared, at least superficially, to have an emphatic CEO view of principalship. Their State High School colleagues did not share this view of principalship although it was of importance to a number of them. It seemed that the school-based management reform agenda had transformed the concept of State High School principalship but in a variety of unexpected ways. An analysis of the interview data revealed that there was an educator-in-chief element operating alongside the principal as CEO mantra. The State High School principals approached their work from a highly defined set of social justice perspectives that matched their socio-democratic concepts of schooling that were articulated so clearly during the interview stage of the study. Both sets of principals in this study did not share the view that schools were unchanging modernist relics. In a Bourdieuan sense the Grammar School principals could point to the deepening of their capitals of pastoral care to debunk such a proposition. Their State High School counterparts referred to the emergence of a capital of innovation underlying their operations. Contemporary leadership theory did not feature as prominently in the interview data as was first expected. While contemporary leadership theory may act as a guide when trying to understand or encode principal leadership, it does little to explain the array of complex forces impacting on school principalship. Rather, a Bourdieuan analysis of principal practice with its set of relationships between habitus, field and capital, provides a more dynamic framework. The major finding of this thesis is that there is indeed a CEO element underlying the operation of contemporary principal practice, but there is also an educator-in-chief element. The CEO concept consisted of a multi-layered patterning that was much more complex than was envisaged at the start of the interview process. There are many reasons for this and a vast number of variations exist on this familiar thematic material. In the analytic framework of this thesis, a significant finding of the research is that principals&#146; worldviews are inextricably linked to habitus and capital as much as they are linked to field. The complex organizational counterpoint underscoring what occurs in schools results in a cacophony which makes principalship complex, diverse and exhausting. Schools are far from modernist relics and in a Bourdieuan sense they are subject to the impact of a number of disparate fields of force that are unique to this era.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158742</field></doc><doc><field name="title">INVESTIGATION INTO THE ATTENUATION OF GRAFT VERSUS HOST DISEASE USING IN VIVO MODELS OF PREPARATIVE CONDITIONING AND DENDRITIC CELL DEPLETION</field><field name="creator">Turner, Brie</field><field name="description">Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is a major limitation to the widespread application of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Pre-transplant myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimens control malignancy, ablate host immune responses and facilitate haematopoietic reconstitution, but they are also associated with significant transplant related mortality (TRM). In addition, conditioning drives host dendritic cell (DC) and donor T-cell interactions that result in GVHD. Reducing the intensity of the conditioning (RIC) regimen maintains anti-leukaemic activity and reduces TRM but the overall incidence of GVHD is unchanged. To date clinically relevant in vivo murine models of RIC allogeneic HSCT do not exist, preventing studies into the mechanism of RIC-associated delayed onset GVHD. We have developed two RIC HSCT models that result in delayed onset GVHD, recapitulating that seen in the clinic. The development of these models has allowed the effect of RIC on chimerism, DC chimerism and subsequent GVHD to be investigated. RIC activates and increases overall DC numbers post-HSCT without triggering early GVHD. Delayed onset GVHD in these RIC HSCT recipients is characterised by the persistence of host cells, a reduced inflammatory response early post- HSCT and the late emergence of activated donor DC. Better understanding of GVHD in the RIC HSCT setting will allow the development of strategies to eradicate the problem of GVHD whilst retaining the graft versus leukaemia (GVL) effect. Host DC play a vital role in the initiation of GVHD, we therefore proposed the strategic administration of DC depleting antibodies as an effective means to control GVHD. N418 the monoclonal antibody against mouse leukocyte integrin CD11c was chosen for the in vivo depletion of DC due to its expression on all murine DC including activated, immature and pDC. The in vivo injection of N418 eliminated 50% of splenic DC in mice. However, subsequent experiments demonstrated that administration of N418 was not sufficient to delay GVHD in either the MHC mismatched or MHC matched, miHA mismatched models of HSCT. Administration of N418 also decreased engraftment and the beneficial effects of GVL. These results suggest that antibody administration may need to be tailored towards a specific subset of DC to prevent GVHD in the absence of immunosuppression and disease relapse. The successful application of DC depletion to control GVHD would improve the safety of HSCT for patients with leukaemia and extend the immune benefits of this curative therapy to the wider patient population.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158743</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Small scale quantum algorithms</field><field name="creator">Travaglione, Benjamin Christopher</field><field name="description">It appears, in principle, that the laws of quantum mechanics allow a quantum computer to solve certain mathematical problems more rapidly than can be done using a classical computer. However, in order to build such a quantum computer, a number of technological problems need to be overcome. A stepping stone to this goal is the implementation of relatively simple quantum algorithms using current experimental techniques. The research work presented in this thesis consists of several theoretical studies exploring small scale quantum algorithms and methods of implementing them. Included in this thesis are an investigation of a small scale version of the phase estimation algorithm, methods of implementing the quantum random walk, a discussion of protecting quantum information by encoding it in an oscillator, and a look at the power of a quantum computer with a restricted number of qubits.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">240201 Theoretical Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158745</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional characterisation of Arabidopsis DRGs : Clues from the DRG2 interactor PDL1</field><field name="creator">Plume, Andrew Michael</field><field name="description">The GTP hydrolases (GTPases) are a ubiquitous superfamily of proteins with diverse cellular roles. Members of the recently-discovered DRG subfamily have been implicated in human disease and may play a role in cell division, differentiation or death. While recent work in our laboratory has focused on the expression and subcellular localisation of DRG1 and DRG2 in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Etheridge et al., 1999; Etheridge, 2002), our understanding of the role of these proteins in planta remains unclear. A yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) library screen using Arabidopsis DRG2 as bait identified 16 interacting proteins, 75% of which are predicted to reside in cellular compartments other than the cytoplasm. Since DRG2 has previously been localised to cytoplasmic vesicles, this observation suggests that DRG2 could be involved in the trafficking of these proteins to their correct cellular locations. A single DRG2 interactor, DRGIP4, was selected for detailed study and its interaction with DRG2 was confirmed in vivo and in vitro. Based on sequence similarity to Pseudomonas PCD/DCoH, DRGIP4 was renamed PDL1 (PCD/DCoH-like protein 1). Members of the widespread PCD/DCoH family are bifunctional proteins which possess catalytic and transcriptional coactivation functions in different cellular compartments and in different oligomeric states. PDL1 is encoded by a single-copy gene in Arabidopsis and shares remarkable secondary and tertiary structural conservation with members of the PCD/DCoH family and is also capable of homomeric associations. PDL1 contains an N-terminal chloroplast transit peptide (cTP) which is functional in planta and is important for interaction with DRG2, suggesting that these proteins interact in the cytoplasm prior to the import of PDL1 into the chloroplast. PDL1 lacks most of the residues important for PCD/DCoH enzymatic activity but may retain a transcriptional coactivation function in the chloroplast. PDL1 homologs in other plants also contain an N-terminal cTP and a PCD/DCoH domain. pdl1 mRNA is expressed at moderate to high levels in the aerial tissues but not in the roots. Accumulation of pdl1 transcripts is light-inducible, and the pdl1 promoter contains several cis-elements which may be responsible for light-responsive transcription. Expression of the intron-GUS reporter gene under the control of the pdl1 promoter generally correlates with mRNA accumulation but reveals tight spatial control of gene expression. Overexpression of pdl1 in transgenic plants does not result in an obvious phenotype. However, downregulation of pdl1 in transgenic plants results in a pale green leaf phenotype associated with a reduction in photosynthetic pigment content and chloroplast numbers per cell. Leaf internal architecture and chloroplast ultrastructure are unaffected in these plants. This phenotype is similar to the arc (accumulation and replication of chloroplasts) mutants and mutants in the chloroplast division and protein import machinery. PDL1 may therefore be involved in the process or regulation of chloroplast division in Arabidopsis. The pdl1 downregulation phenotype is also associated with pleiotropic effects on plant growth. A second PCD/DCoH-like protein, PDL2, was identified in the Arabidopsis genome sequence. Like PDL1, PDL2 shares limited primary sequence similarity to members of the PCD/DCoH family but retains characteristic secondary and tertiary structural features. PDL2 contains an N-terminal mitochondrial transit peptide (mTP) and is expressed at low levels in all plant tissues. PDL2 homologs in other plants also contain an N-terminal mTP and a PCD/DCoH domain. The significance of PDL2 for the function of PDL1 and DRG2 is not yet clear. Overexpression of drg1 in transgenic plants does not result in an obvious phenotype, while downregulation of drg1 in transgenic plants affects general aspects of plant growth which may be unrelated to DRG1 function. To investigate the role of DRGs in a different model system, homologs of drg1 and drg2 were isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker&#146;s yeast) and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (fission yeast). Knockout of either or both genes in transgenic yeast is non-lethal and results in sensitivity to agents which disrupt intra- and inter-molecular protein interactions. This phenotype is consistent with a role in protein trafficking. Overexpression of drg1 or drg2 in S. cerevisiae does not result in an obvious phenotype, while overexpression of either gene in S. pombe results in a slow growth phenotype. DRG1 and DRG2 are localised in the cytoplasm in S. pombe. The results presented here suggest that DRGs may be involved in the trafficking of proteins to different subcellular compartments. This research has provided a foundation for the detailed functional characterisation of plant and yeast DRGs and of the novel PDL family in Arabidopsis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="subject">270300 Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158746</field></doc><doc><field name="title">WHAT CONSTITUTES SUCCESS IN PACIFIC ISLAND COMMUNITY CONSERVED AREAS?</field><field name="creator">Axford, Joanna</field><field name="description">Community conserved areas (CCAs) are one of the most prominent forms of protected area in the Pacific islands region. CCAs provide a more socially appropriate approach to conservation than government or exclusive protected areas. Despite this, few CCAs in the Pacific islands have been judged a success. This history of failed initiatives has resulted in increased emphasis on what is required to achieve success at all stages of CCA development (e.g. site selection, establishment and management). Despite the emphasis on success in CCAs and other protected area approaches, the term &#145;success&#146; has not been examined or defined, but is generally framed within expectations, values and disciplinary boundaries. As a result, what actually constitutes success, from a variety of perspectives, is largely unknown. If we are to understand why CCAs are failing, then it is important to unravel the concept of success itself. This thesis is based on the premise that it is essential to first understand what constitutes success in CCAs from the perspective of the actors associated with these areas, if we are to understand why they are or are not successful. This work was approached through three major phases. The first phase reviewed the research area and provided an overview of the issues and the context for inquiry. Upon commencement of this research there was no up-to-date centralised source of Pacific protected area information. The Pacific Protected Area Database was developed as part of this work. Analysis of the database demonstrated the growth and development of the Pacific island&#146;s formal protected area system over the past 100 years. The rise of CCAs as a formally recognised approach to protected area management within the region is identified. The new wave of political support and international promotion of protected areas within the Pacific islands and its impact on CCAs were considered. Given the perception that Pacific CCAs are failing to succeed, the nature of success from the perspective of the different CCA actors were explored in the second phase of this work. This phase, the most in-depth and detailed stage, represents the foundation for theory building. Two separate data-gathering activities with insiders (local actors) and outsiders (external actors) were undertaken. Firstly, outsiders connected with Pacific island CCAs were surveyed through a qualitative questionnaire which explored the issue of success and failure in Pacific CCAs. Time was then spent in five Pacific island CCAs, investigating local-level perspectives of success and failure. Each CCA differed in its management approach, objectives, history and connections with external parties. Community perceptions of success and failure in their CCA, as well as their understanding of conservation, the CCA and motivation to support the village CCA, were explored. The third phase of the research synthesised the results and investigated the potential to reconcile various perceptions of success. Outsiders were again surveyed through a qualitative questionnaire. This last data-gathering activity explored the validity of the results gathered from fieldwork with insiders and the broad applicability of those results in the other CCAs in the Pacific islands. Outsiders were surveyed to explore the perceptual congruency between insider and outsider perceptions of success, conservation and CCA motivation. Outsider views were cooriented against insider views. Results indicate that success is multidimensional and a diversity of perceptions of success exist between and within local CCA communities and between and within outsiders involved with Pacific CCAs. Both insider and outsider groups identified common success themes related to: community, benefits, environmental elements, management, and, external involvement. However, the content, meaning and emphasis of each of these themes differed greatly between and within each group of actors. Specifically, the dissertation provides evidence of differences in how community members and outsiders view CCAs and their success. It was found that success perceptions are influenced by the individual&#146;s frame of reference, especially how they conceive conservation and the CCA. To demonstrate how success is conceived a Conservation-Success model was developed. The model demonstrates how the frame of reference used for judging success will reflect individual actor contextual factors, how conservation was communicated and understood, as well as individual expectations of the CCA. The outcomes of this research challenge current approaches to CCA implementation and evaluation, in which internal and external views are regarded as congruent when, in fact, they are incongruent in many aspects. Insiders and outsiders have at times, vastly different understandings of conservation and the CCA, and therefore different systems for assessing CCA success. The results highlight some of the problems and gaps with current approaches and understandings of CCAs in the Pacific, with regional and global relevance and applicability.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158747</field></doc><doc><field name="title">TREATMENT OF CERVICAL CANCER USING RNA-INTERFERENCE AGAINST HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS ONCOGENES</field><field name="creator">Putral, Lisa</field><field name="description">Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the infectious agent responsible for the development of cervical cancer, with type 16 responsible for 50% of all cases. Cervical cancer remains the number one cancer killer of women under 50 worldwide, resulting in more than 270,000 deaths each year. Tumours caused by human HPV infection are an ideal model system for RNA interference-based cancer therapies as the oncogenes which cause cervical cancer, E6 and E7, are only expressed in cervical cancer cells. Furthermore, E6 and E7 are absolutely required for the ongoing proliferation of cervical cancer cells, as it has been demonstrated that upon their suppression, cells undergo apoptosis or senescence. In this study, siRNAs were designed that were directed against the HPV E6 and E7 oncogenes that simultaneously targeted both E6 and E7 with a single siRNA. These siRNAs were shown to reduce E7 protein levels by 80%. Following siRNA treatment, it was observed that there was reactivation of the p53 tumour suppressor pathway. The loss of E6 and E7 in cervical cancer cell lines resulted in a reduction in cellular viability concurrent with the induction of cellular senescence. RNA interference was specific as no effect on HPV-negative cells was observed. It was also shown in this study that RNAi against E6 and E7 oncogenes enhances the chemotherapeutic effect of cisplatin in HeLa cells following a combined treatment, resulting in a four-fold increase in cytotoxicity for the combined treatment as compared to cisplatin alone. Upon co-treatment with cisplatin and shRNA expressed from a plasmid, a decrease in E7 expression was observed with a concurrent increase in p53 protein levels over that seen with either treatment alone. These results provide strong evidence that loss of E6 and E7 results in increased sensitivity to cisplatin, and that this effect may occur as a result of increased p53 protein levels. This research also investigated the potential for a liposome-based system to facilitate the delivery of siRNA to tumours in vivo. It was demonstrated that liposomes produced by a lyophilisation method entrap nucleic acids with high efficiency (greater than 60%), can fully protect nucleic acids from digestion with nucleases, and are taken up by more than 90% of cells in culture. It was also demonstrated that these liposomes are able to accumulate at tumour sites in vivo in immune-competent mice. Despite excellent cellular uptake, siRNAs entrapped within liposomes were not transfection-competent, suggesting an inability of siRNAs to dissociate from liposomes, localize in the cytoplasm and become available to the silencing machinery. This research lays the groundwork for further development of effective liposomes for the in vivo delivery of siRNA nucleotides.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158748</field></doc><doc><field name="title">LAYERED DOUBLE HYDROXIDES FOR CO2 CAPTURE</field><field name="creator">Mereddy, Kodanda</field><field name="description">Atmospheric concentrations of several greenhouse gases, in particular, carbon dioxide (CO2) have increased significantly in the recent past largely due to the combustion of fossil fuels. The capture of CO2 from industrial flue gases has therefore become a vital issue attracting the attention of several research groups and organisations in the world. One of the important options to control CO2 emissions is carbon dioxide sequestration that is, capturing and securely storing CO2 emitted from major sources of emission. There are several existing options available for CO2 capture however, each of these systems has its own limitations that impede the technical or economical viability in CO2 post combustion capture systems. Selective adsorption mechanism is a promising technique considered for CO2 separation. A few inorganic materials (zeolites and activated carbons) were found to have good adsorption capacities of CO2. However, they are not attractive for separation from wet feeds at high temperatures due to poor hydrothermal stability. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are novel inorganic compounds, and in particular their layered double oxide (LDO) derivatives produced on calcination have desired properties as CO2 adsorbents in post-combustion capture applications. LDHs were prepared by the co-precipitation of divalent Mg and trivalent Al ions in an alkaline solution containing NaOH/Na2CO3. Samples were characterised before and after calcination using various techniques such as FTIR, XRD, TGA and XPS. Different LDH samples prepared were screened to identify the samples with optimum sorption properties. CO2 sorption was measured both volumetrically and thermogravimetrically as a function of calcination and sorption temperatures. Reversible sorption (desorption) capacities were determined using vacuum and temperature cycling methods. A thorough investigation of aspects pertaining to aging, regeneration, impact of water and sorption potentials of the remaining flue gas components including SOx and NOx was conducted during this research. The findings and discussions from this work provide following major contributions to the CO2 capture research. &#149; Significant increase in the CO2 sorption capacity of LDOs by using novel synthesis procedure; &#149; Recyclability with good sorption/desorption potential and more than 90% regenerabilty of LDOs; &#149; Mechanistic aspects of CO2 sorption identified based on heats of adsorption and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) data; &#149; Good hydrothermal stability and SOx sorption capacity with potential for high temperature CO2 separation application from flue gas; &#149; High sorption values and consistent performance even at low CO2 partial pressures of flue gas. The first contribution of this work is related to the synthesis of LDOs leading to best CO2 sorption capacity (1.20 mmol/g). Using novel synthesis procedure an increase of 100% in the sorption capacity was achieved over the sorption capacity of conventionally prepared LDOs. This was possible by choosing optimum reactant concentrations and conditions from the large number of LDH samples prepared and tested. In this study Mg/Al ratio of 3 and CO3 2- concentration of 0.33M were found to be the optimum values leading to high sorption capacity. Further, rate of addition of metal ions and aging of the reaction mixture were also found to produce LDOs with better surface properties including higher surface area. Calcination of LDH at appropriate temperature leading to LDO formation was another important aspect that influenced sorption capacity. Calcination temperature of 400 oC was found ideal for the LDHs prepared with above concentrations. Excellent regenerability and stability of the material after repeated vacuum and temperature cycles with good sorption/desorption potential refers to the second contribution of this work. Sample MAC2 exhibited up to 88% reversibility (desorption) of the total sorption on vacuum evacuation while MAC5 sample which showed maximum sorption (1.20 mmol/g) released up to 58%. However, temperature cycling produced over 70% reversibility with all the samples. High consistency observed in the sorption/desorption patterns after six cycles demonstrated the stability and recyclability of this material. In all the cases more than 90% of the original sorption capacity was recovered after regeneration. Aging or storage of LDOs in the atmosphere found to produce significant structural changes leading to more than 25% reduction in the sorption capacities. An in-situ calcination method was found to be highly productive and suggested for all sorption measurements of LDO to over come these losses. The third contribution of this work relates to identifying the type of sorption and mechanism. Isosteric heat of sorption (71.46 kJ/mol) calculated from the sorption isotherms suggests that it is mostly a chemisorption process. Increase of sorption values with temperature up to 200 oC also proves that the sorption process involves activation energy. TPD results also revealed that only a small amount (7.82%) of total sorption is a weak adsorption. Hence, it is concluded that CO2 sorption on LDO is mostly a chemisorption process rather than physisorption. Finally CO2 sorption on LDO is explained with a suitable mechanism in correlation with TPD results. The fourth contribution is provided by demonstrated hydrothermal stability and superior SOx sorption potential of LDOs. Unlike with other solid sorbents such as zeolites, presence of water in the feed proved to have no adverse impact on CO2 sorption efficiency of LDOs. Water was found to adsorb on LDO simultaneously along with CO2 by increasing the sorption value up to 76% over the maximum dry CO2 sorption value observed at 200 oC. Similar behaviour observed at 300 and 400 oC proved the hydrothermal stability of LDO. The water uptake of the LDOs which was found to be approximately equal to the difference of wet and dry CO2 sorptions proved that water did not restrict CO2 sorption. Consistent sorption/desorption behaviour observed after six temperature cycles also revealed the hydrothermal stability of the sorbent. LDOs found to have very high sorption potential of SOx. Even at low feed concentrations of SOx (0.1% in N2) the sorption values were very high (6.65%) indicating strong affinity of SOx for LDO. SOx sorption was observed to be much stronger as regenerartion levels are less than 50%. All the other constituents of flue gas including NOx showed no sorption property towards LDO. Final contribution resulted from the testing of sorption performance under flue gas concentrations. For the first time LDOs were tested using mixed gas containing 14% CO2 in wet and dry conditions. LDO demonstrated excellent sorption/desorption behaviour with the sorption values equivalent to 70% of the single gas measurements even though CO2 concentration decreased by seven times. The performance in the presence of water was similar to that observed in the case of single gas. Temperature cycling between 200- 300 oC found to be highly effective with 70% reversibility both in dry and wet conditions. Preferential sorption of SOx over CO2 was observed to influence CO2 sorption capacity. Future research should be aimed at further improvement of the CO2 sorption capacities of LDOs by introducing alkali or alkali earth metal oxide promoters. Vacuum temperature swing adsorption (VTSA) method will be considered to achieve high sorption reversibility. Membrane synthesis using LDOs will be another interesting aspect to consider.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158749</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Work-Related Neck Pain in Female Office Workers: A Psychosocial and Physiological Profile</field><field name="creator">Johnston, Venerina</field><field name="description">Work-related musculoskeletal disorders comprise a significant proportion of workplace injuries in the western industrialized society and a burden on our workers&#146; compensation system. In particular, work with computers is associated with an increased risk for neck pain which is more prevalent in women. To provide effective prevention and management programs, a better understanding of the processes underlying these disorders is necessary. This research aimed to obtain a profile of the psychosocial and physiological characteristics of female office workers with self-reported neck pain and disability. The first aim was to identify factors within the workplace (psychosocial and ergonomic) associated with a greater risk of neck pain in a sample of female office workers. The second aim was to map the relationship between quantitative sensory measures and neck pain in a subset of these workers. Finally, a study of cervical musculoskeletal function was undertaken using recordings of the myoelectric activity of the superficial cervical flexors and extensors during functional and non-functional tasks. The neck disability index (NDI) was the outcome measure for all studies. Study 1: Risk factors within the workplace were identified using a comprehensive self-report survey distributed to organizations employing female office workers. The interaction between the three main psychosocial domains was investigated after controlling for individual and ergonomic risk factors. It was found that as job demands increased, high decision authority had an increasing effect on the level of neck pain and disability when supervisor support was low. Study 2: Individual and ergonomic factors within the work environment associated with the presence and the severity of neck pain in the female office worker are reported in this study. Higher NDI scores were associated with: using the computer mouse longer than six hours per day, greater negative affectivity (an inherent personality trait), older age and an uncomfortable workstation. Most workstation features were not significantly associated with NDI scores. Factors associated with neck pain were: a history of neck trauma, wearing vision correction with graduated lenses and greater negative affectivity. The results suggest a combination of individual and task demands need to be evaluated to better target workplace prevention and intervention campaigns.

The next three papers report on the sensory and motor changes associated with neck pain in a sub-set of the office workers who participated in the survey. Volunteers who met the inclusion criteria (n=85) were categorized according to their scores on the NDI: no pain (33, NDI;&amp;lt8); mild pain (38, NDI 9-29); moderate pain (14, NDI;&amp;gt30). A fourth group of non-working women without neck pain (n=22) formed the control group. Study 3: The relationship between sensory features and participant group was explored using quantitative sensory testing. The results showed a moderate dose-response relationship between pain level and sensory measures with significant multi-modal changes in response to temperature, pressure pain threshold and vibration stimuli. These findings provide evidence of widespread sensitivity most likely due to altered central nociceptive processing initiated and sustained by peripheral nociceptive input. Study 4: Physical impairments in motion and cervical muscle function were explored using surface electromyography to record myoelectric activity of the cervical flexor muscles during cranio-cervical flexion, and of the cervical flexor and extensor muscles during a unilateral arm task. Workers with neck pain demonstrated reduced rotation movement and altered muscle recruitment strategies consistent with other cervical musculoskeletal disorders. Study 5: The myoelectric activity of the cervical flexor and extensor muscles during and after five minutes of copy-typing, typing with stress and stress only tasks was recorded. Workers (with and without neck pain) demonstrated higher activity than controls in the cervical flexor and extensor muscles in response to these tasks which was not observed in the upper trapezii. This suggests that stress may not be a primary reason for these findings but rather they represent altered cervical muscle recruitment related to a musculoskeletal disorder. Study 6: The contribution of all factors associated with neck pain in female office workers was explored using regression modelling. Variables differentiating workers with and without pain were: using the computer mouse longer than six hours per day, higher negative affectivity scores, cold hyperalgesia, reduced neck rotation, longer duration of symptoms and higher activity in the cervical flexors during cranio-cervical flexion. These findings suggest that a combination of work practices, an inherent psychological state, altered pain processing and altered muscle function can identify workers with greater neck pain. The results of this thesis represent a significant contribution to understanding the pathophysiological processes associated with neck pain in female office workers. There are global deficits in the processing of pain and motor control strategies utilized during functional and stressful tasks. In the presence of prolonged computer mouse use, and augmented by the psychological state of negative affectivity, these deficits have a negative impact on health and well-being of office workers. Management of neck pain in office workers requires a multidisciplinary approach to address the many factors associated with neck pain and disability.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158750</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PLANT CYCLOTIDES : Evolution, Biosynthesis and Application of Circular Cystine Knot Mini-Proteins</field><field name="creator">Gruber, Christian</field><field name="description">Cyclotides are a recently discovered family of small plant peptides exhibiting a range of interesting biological activities. They are defined by two unique structural features: a circular peptide backbone and three disulfide bonds in a knotted arrangement, which together form the so-called cyclic cystine knot motif. Their compact three-dimensional fold makes them exceptionally stable towards thermal, chemical and enzymatic degradation. They are being explored for pharmaceutical and agrochemical applications. This thesis addresses several important questions concerning cyclotide biology and chemistry using an interdisciplinary approach. The Introduction (Chapter 1) reviews the current understanding in the literature of circular and disulfide-rich proteins, with emphasis on plant cyclotides and gives an overview of oxidative protein folding within the cell, with a particular focus on protein disulfide isomerases. The remainder of the thesis then describes a combination of different molecular biology, protein chemistry and biophysical techniques (Chapter 2) to gain further knowledge about the distribution and evolution of plant cyclotides (Chapter 3), their oxidative folding assisted by protein disulfide isomerase (Chapter 4), their production and characterisation in plant suspension cultures (Chapter 5) and the development of modified cyclotides as a tool to study their mode-of-action (Chapter 6). The final chapter draws the work together and points to future directions in cyclotide research. In the course of these studies over 200 coffee family plant species (Rubiaceae) were analysed for the occurrence of cyclotides. Rubiaceae is the fourth largest flowering family on earth and includes ~8% of the world&#146;s flora. The presence of cyclotides was confirmed in 21 species and their distribution suggests an independent evolution of circular proteins in various plant families and further, estimates cyclotides to be a very large protein family, possibly with up to 50,000 members still to be discovered. Another major part of this thesis concerns the oxidative folding of cyclotides using a novel isolated protein disulfide isomerase from Oldenlandia affinis (OaPDI) that is a major source of cyclotides. Data collected from detailed biochemical analyses suggest that OaPDI is a potent disulfide isomerase that significantly increases the correct folding of cyclotides and gives them their properties as active insecticides. Furthermore, OaPDI and the Oak1 cyclotide precursor transcripts are co-expressed in the plant and the proteins interact with each other. The precursor&#146;s N-terminal repeat (NTR) region appears to be important for this interaction. The expression and production of cyclotides was monitored in plant suspension cultures. Finally, modified cyclotides were developed as a tool for future studies investigating their insecticidal and cell-penetrating mode-of-action. The novel aspects of this thesis include; (i) the discovery of several cyclotide producing plant species and the development of a model for their evolution within the coffee family, (ii) the thorough biochemical analysis of a plant PDI and its role in the oxidative folding of cyclotides, (iii) the characterisation of cyclotide expression in plant suspension cultures, and (iv) the development of cyclotide research tools to study their mode-of-action. These findings will be crucial in exploring the potential of cyclotides as molecular scaffolds and candidates for agrochemical and pharmaceutical agents and will further help to decipher the oxidative folding process within the endoplasmic reticulum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158751</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceptions, performance and economics of renewable energy supply within the Australian tourism accommodation industry</field><field name="creator">Dalton, Gordon</field><field name="description">The technical performance and economic viability of renewable energy technology within the Australian tourism accommodation industry is assessed. This is contrasted with the present perceptions of tourism operators to the use of Renewable Energy Supply (RES) as a power source for tourist accommodation. Three surveys were undertaken to determine the perceptions of the tourism industry toward RES. The first survey focused on a broad group of tourist operators, with the aim of ascertaining their level of interest toward RES and their perceptions of the barriers to the uptake of RES by the industry. This survey also examined tourist operator perceptions of tourist attitudes toward RES. The second survey targeted a sample of tourist operations with RES already installed, with the aim of comparing the attitudes of these operators to those from the first survey. The third survey targeted tourists as consumers, with the aim of identifying their attitudes to RES, and how these compared to those of tourist operators. The validity of the perceptions of RES identified in the surveys was tested using case study assessments conducted on three tourist operations where RES was installed. These operations were small and medium-scale hotels (;&amp;lt100 rooms) that were reliant on hybrid stand-alone power supplies that incorporated RES technology. The technical feasibility and reliability of the existing RES installations were assessed, together with the economic viability of the existing configuration in comparison to conventional thermal (generator or grid) supply. The assessment also examined the potential for improvements to the existing configuration through optimisation modeling. Economic and technical assessments were based on renewable fraction (RF), net present cost (NPC) and payback time. Two RES modeling tools were utilised for these assessments; HOMER (NREL, US), and HYBRIDS (Solaris Homes, Australia). Information on installed RES at the three field sites was attained from site visits, and load data was collected from on-site load monitoring. A final case study was conducted on a large-scale hotel to assess whether the results from the first three case studies were pertinent to large-scale operations. The survey results show that the tourist operators sampled had a positive attitude towards the concept of RES. Nevertheless, perceived barriers to RES uptake included technical feasibility, lack of reliability and questionable economic viability. However, the results of the second survey, which interviewed tourist operators with RES, showed that in the majority of cases examined, installed RES technology was reported as operational and reliable. It indicated that the attitudes of tourist operators in the first survey may be unfounded. The sample of tourists surveyed in the third survey suggested that tourists had a more positive attitude to RES than was perceived by tourist operators. The analyses of RES equipped tourist operations demonstrated that RES was technically feasible for both the sample of small and medium-sized operations. Furthermore, the RES installations examined were economically competitive with generator-only alternatives. Optimisation analyses identified that improved system configurations were possible in all three case studies, offering increased RF, lower NPC and attractive payback time in comparison with the installed configuration or generator-only configurations. An assessment of the influence of carbon tax on NPC demonstrated that the taxes need to be as high as those imposed by Sweden before an impact is reflected in NPC. Optimisation modeling consistently determined that WECS/hybrid set-ups were the most economically viable option in comparison to PV for the sample case studies. Modeling of a large-scale resort using RES as either a stand-alone supply, or in conjunction with grid electricity, led to similar conclusions. Modeling also indicated that hydrogen technologies are not an economically viable RES at present. In conclusion, the existing operational RES installations in the case studies, which were competitive with thermal supply, indicate that the negative sentiment expressed by tourist operators as a whole appears unjustified. Furthermore, modeling illustrates that improved financial return is possible through system optimisation, and this indicates the importance of correct system design prior to installation. Finally, the results show that WECS and WECS/hybrid systems should be more widely considered as a micro-generation RES technology.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158752</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploration and Analysis of the Origins, Nature and Development of the Sufi Movement in Australia</field><field name="creator">Genn, Celia Anne</field><field name="description">Between 1910 and 1926, Hazrat Inayat Khan, a musician and Sufi master from the Chishtiyya order in India, introduced Sufism to the United States of America and Europe. He established a Western Sufi order, the International Sufi Movement, with groups in America, England, and across Europe. In the early 1930s this Western Sufism was introduced into Australia. The aim of this study is to explore and analyse the origins, nature and development of the Sufi Movement in Australia with particular attention to the relationship between the spiritual teacher and the disciple. The study, in its various aspects, and as a whole, makes a contribution to understanding religious change, religion and New Religious Movements in Australia, Sufism in the West and the murshid-mureed relationship. Using what has been termed a &#147;dynamic of religions&#148; framework and Baumann&#146;s model of religious adaptation in cross-cultural circumstances, the study employs a combination of in-depth fieldwork, participant observation, interviews and historiography to identify and analyse both continuity and change in Sufi Movement groups in contemporary Australia. The study found that the early phases of transplantation from India to Europe and America, as well as the struggles within the group after the death of Inayat Khan, substantially shaped the Western Sufism that arrived in Australia. The most significant early adaptations included redefining the relationship between Sufism and exoteric Islam, gender equality, formation of a formal organisation, and the use of music to spread the Sufi Message. Addressing issues identified in the literature on the master-disciple relationship in Eastern traditions in the West, the study describes and analyses the murshid-mureed (master-disciple, spiritual teacher-student) relationship in Inayat Khan&#146;s time, and in contemporary Australia. It shows that Sufism&#146;s development in the West has been interconnected with understandings and practice of this central relationship. The study shows that the continued strength of the murshid-mureed relationship alongside emerging alternatives, the factors affecting change generally in the Sufi Movement, as well as the growing popularity of Sufism in Australia, demonstrate the need to consider not only East-West aspects of transplantation, but also the influences of modernity on spiritual traditions. As well as documenting the Australian history, the study describes the details of the variety of practices and rituals, forms of community and organisation, and forms of the murshid-mureed relationship, found in contemporary Australian groups. This provides insight into the intricacies of Sufi practice in Australia and provides a basis for comparison with other groups. Sufi practice within these groups in Australia includes highly innovative developments alongside preservation of the tradition as taught by Inayat Khan. It also reflects a tension between the spiritual and organisational hierarchy, and concerns for democracy and local autonomy.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">440206 Studies in Other Religious Traditions</field><field name="subject">780199 Other</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158753</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predicting weed seed persistence: towards a technique for rapid and reliable assessment</field><field name="creator">Long, Rowena Louise</field><field name="description">Management of weed species is often complicated by the unknown status of their soil seed banks. Field trials for evaluating seed persistence, whilst accurate in their context, are timeconsuming and expensive. Weed scientists and land managers alike would benefit from a more rapid method for estimating weed seed longevity. This study aimed to develop a laboratory-based method for predicting weed seed persistence in the field. The accelerated ageing test, which ages seeds at high relative humidity (RH) and temperature, is used at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, UK, to predict the rate of death of seeds kept in cold dry storage for conservation purposes. In this study, a field seed burial experiment, laboratory experiments, and longevity data provided by other research organisations were used to thoroughly assess whether results of the accelerated ageing test correlate with field persistence of seeds. Initially, the seed persistence of three weed species in the field was compared to their longevity in the accelerated ageing test. A 21-month field trial was established to evaluate the persistence of Avena sterilis L. ssp. ludoviciana (Dur.) Nyman (wild oats), Gomphocarpus physocarpus E.Mey. (balloon cotton bush) and Ligustrum lucidum W.T.Aiton (broadleaf privet) seeds in three contrasting soil types introduced to the same location. The viability and vigour of filled seeds retrieved from the field trial were monitored, as were the physical and chemical characteristics of the soils. Seed persistence and vigour of each species varied according to soil type in the trial. However, species had the same order of life expectancy (shortest-lived to longest-lived) within each soil type. Importantly, field persistence of species supported the order of seed longevity for species in the accelerated ageing test. Moreover, a comparison of larger externally available data sets verified the observed correlation, indicating that the accelerated ageing test could be an informative predictor of seed persistence in the field. The correlation between seed persistence in the field and longevity in the accelerated ageing test, although positive, did not explain all of the variation in the field persistence data. Moisture fluctuations experienced by seeds in the field but not in the laboratory were hypothesised to influence seed persistence, and further laboratory studies were conducted to elucidate the effects of wetting and drying cycles on seed longevity. When seeds of G. physocarpus were hydrated to 94% RH or higher then re-dried, their longevity was extended, suggesting that rain may extend the persistence of seeds of some species. In other laboratory tests, the physiological basis for the correlation between field and accelerated ageing results was investigated. As seeds age, deteriorative processes such as lipid peroxidation and free radical accumulation cause membranes to become more permeable and the redox status of antioxidants to change. Membrane integrity and antioxidant capacity differed between A. sterilis seeds that were aged in the field and those aged in the accelerated ageing test. The disparities were attributed to differences in the moisture content of seeds between the two environments. Thus, despite the correlation between the longevity of seeds under natural and artificial ageing, the physiological basis for the relationship was dubious. To better simulate field ageing conditions on seeds in the laboratory, a new laboratory test was developed. In the soil-specific accelerated ageing test (SSAAT), more factors from natural environments, including soils, were introduced to the accelerated ageing regime. When RH and temperature were controlled, no differences in seed longevity were observed between soil types. These results suggest that temperature and seed moisture content are the two major factors affecting seed longevity in moist unsaturated soils; soils interact with climate to alter these parameters and affect seed ageing in situ. Thus the SSAAT conferred no advantages over the standard accelerated ageing test protocol. Based on its positive correlation with field persistence and the lack of improved predictions arising from SSAAT, the standard accelerated ageing test was re-embraced as an informative predictor of weed seed persistence. Comparison of the seed longevity of 13 Queensland weed species in the accelerated ageing test with field persistence data enabled three persistence categories to be defined. Results of the 3-month accelerated ageing test may now be used to predict the maximum likely field persistence of a seed lot within the categories of ;&amp;lt 1 year, 1 to 3 years, and ;&amp;gt 3 years. In summary, this study identified a laboratory-based test for estimating seed persistence in the field, and improved our understanding of the physiology of natural seed ageing. In the future, these advances should enable better-informed weed management decisions, as the appropriate duration of weed monitoring programmes can now be readily estimated.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158754</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Leisure of Young Adults: Exploring health and leisure links and how leisure is used to relieve a bored or depressed mood state</field><field name="creator">Han, Ji-Sook</field><field name="description">Young people&#146;s experience of boredom and/or depression is often reported as a negative factor that influences their health. Although leisure has a number of psychological benefits that have the potential to assist young people to cope with their negative mood states, there has been little research to investigate how these benefits are utilised in their daily life. From this perspective, this study explored the role that leisure plays in relieving boredom and depression of young adults and how their health status is linked to the leisure behaviours. The question of how leisure involves young adults when they attempt to relieve a bored and/or depressed mood state was firstly explored through focus group interviews. Secondly, a questionnaire survey was conducted using a total of 433 university students to investigate the different characteristics associated with their leisure behaviours and to determine their relationships with health related variables. Other related leisure and psychological variables were tested to search for the positive factors that contributed to their healthy leisure participation and to provide relief from their boredom and/or depression states. The results demonstrated that the high frequency types of leisure that young adults participated in to relieve a bored or depressed mood state were casual, unstructured or passive home types of leisure such as listening to music, watching TV, surfing the Internet, going out with friends, eating, doing nothing, or sleeping. Other positive leisure types were also identified in the middle ranking of choice. These included sports and physical activities, outdoor activities, travel, creative activities, housework and school related reading. In addition, other types of risky health leisure involvement such as drinking, smoking, and/or drug use were identified at a lower ranking. Factor analysis further demonstrated that there were eight boredom relief leisure types &#150; &#145;active &#8901; social,&#146; &#145;work related,&#146; &#145;creative,&#146; &#145;sports &#8901; physical,&#146; &#145;outdoor travel,&#146; &#145;casual,&#146; &#145;passive technology&#146; and &#145;passive home&#146; leisure. Similarly, eight depression relief leisure types were also identified - &#145;active &#8901; social,&#146; &#145;work related,&#146; &#145;sports &#8901; physical,&#146; &#145;creative,&#146; &#145;outdoor travel,&#146; &#145;relaxing,&#146; &#145;deviant&#146; and &#145;passive technology&#146; leisure. Similarities as well as differences were found between young adults&#146; boredom and depression relief leisure behaviour, while gender differences were identified in both boredom and depression relief leisure behaviour. Significant relationships were verified between young adults&#146; leisure behaviour that was engaged in to relieve a bored and/or depressed mood state and their health. Positive, active or healthy leisure behaviour engaged in to relieve boredom or depression (e.g., active &#8901; social, work related, creative, sports &#8901; physical, or outdoor travel leisure participation) was found to positively influence health. On the other hand, comparatively negative, passive or unhealthy types of leisure behaviour engaged in to relieve a bored and/or depressed mood state (e.g., passive home, passive technology, deviant, or relaxing leisure) were found to have a negative impact on a young person&#146;s health. Leisure awareness was identified as a significant positive factor for wise leisure behaviour in relieving boredom and/or depression. Practical leisure awareness (leisure skills or wise leisure participation) had a stronger impact than the cognitive or attitudinal variables (knowledge of leisure or leisure attitudes). The leisure behaviour that was engaged in to relieve boredom and/or depression also had a significant relationship with several psychological variables. Positive or healthy types of leisure behaviour used to relieve boredom or depression were positively related to higher negative mood regulation and a lower level of experiencing boredom or depression. Empirical models of leisure, health and psychological variables were developed in which the levels of impact of each study variable on health variables were demonstrated. Leisure awareness was found to have a stronger impact than other variables on both psychological wellbeing and perceived health. Negative or unhealthy boredom or depression relief leisure behaviour factors such as passive home, passive technology, deviant or relaxing leisure were found to have a stronger negative impact on both psychological wellbeing and perceived health than others. However, &#145;sports &#8901; physical&#146; boredom or depression relief leisure behaviour factor had a stronger positive impact on perceived health. Young adults&#146; leisure styles that are engaged in to relieve a bored or depressed mood state were also explored. Five boredom relief leisure styles were identified as &#145;creative,&#146; &#145;work related,&#146; &#145;multiple,&#146; &#145;active&#146; and &#145;passive&#146; and four depression relief leisure styles identified as &#145;inactive,&#146; &#145;deviant,&#146; &#145;work related&#146; and &#145;active.&#146; Significant differences in leisure, health and psychological variables were demonstrated according to different leisure involvement styles.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158755</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fundamental processes affecting aquatic rare earth element chemistry; new experimental and empirical observations towards a proxy for anthropogenic change</field><field name="creator">Lawrence, Michael Glen</field><field name="description">Previous research has indicated that coral can be used as an in situ biogeochemical archive of palaeoclimatic and paleaoenvironmental change. The rare earth elements have been used in geologic and groundwater studies as provenance indicators, and recent observations suggest that their concentrations in coral may show a secular change. It has further been proposed that the change in coral rare earth element concentration over time is indicative of anthropogenic change. In this thesis, I examine the use of the rare earth elements and yttrium (REY), with a view towards further establishing the REY as a widely accepted proxy for change in the near-shore ocean environment. The thesis takes a fundamental approach to that goal. I first develop methods for the analysis of the REY in fresh and saline water. Then I apply these methods to the understanding of REY behaviour in freshwater catchments and through the estuary. In the course of these experiments, I discovered that the REY do indeed show provincial behaviour in freshwater, and that aspects of the REY pattern can be altered due to anthropogenic change in the environment. I also discovered further aspects of REY chemistry that had, hitherto, not been explicitly stated. These include the pseudo conservative behaviour (relative to the other REY) of europium and gadolinium during estuarine mixing and the correlation of the cerium anomaly with reduced iron, signalling the importance of pore water to the overall biogeochemical budget of the coastal ocean. These experimental observations lead to the conclusion that from theoretical prediction at least, the REY may indeed be suitable tools for investigating palaeoclimatic or palaeoenvironmental change (anthropogenic or otherwise) in coral (and other proxies) that were subject to such change. Only after establishing this framework did I attempt to analyse a coral core, from which temporal variability of the REY content was investigated. Prior to trace element analysis, the coral core chronology was established, and the core examined for diagenetic alteration. The coral core was then analysed by laser ablation ICP-MS. I compare the baseline and flood event REY patterns and concentration throughout the core, especially in the pre- and post-European periods (pre- and post-1860). However, despite flood events and baseline REY incorporation resulting in distinct REY patterns, there is no evidence to suggest a secular change in either the concentration of the REY or a shift in the shape of the REY pattern (for either the flood events or the baseline winter incorporation) that could indicate an alteration of the REY supply to the location of this coral core. This contrasts with recent results from coral under the influence of the Burdekin River discharge, suggesting that inland agricultural activity (largely grazing) apparently has a more detrimental effect on coastal water quality than crop agriculture along the shore. My research has demonstrated that aspects of REY chemistry may indeed provide useful proxies for anthropogenic or environmental change. Especially the cerium, europium and gadolinium anomalies and in some cases Y/Ho fractionation may eventually become useful features to investigate. However, while the analytical protocol developed for this study was able to obtain in situ REY data for a coral, I was unable, in the coastal coral selected for this study, to discover any evidence for secular change. Further studies are required along the entire North Queensland shore to carefully map out the areas that are most threatened by deteriorating water quality.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158756</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MOLECULAR MODELLING OF POLAR AND NON-POLAR ADSORPTION ON CARBON ADSORBENTS</field><field name="creator">Birkett, Greg</field><field name="description">Adsorption is an industrially important process that remains a vibrant and continuing area of research. The current state of the art in theoretical adsorption studies is molecular simulation with its molecular level determinism of thermodynamic behaviour. This thesis aims to investigate a range of adsorption behaviour through the use of Monte Carlo simulation. Through the duration of this project the thermodynamic properties of adsorption isotherms, heats of adsorption and adsorbed phase heat capacities have been studied for a range of fluids from argon to water. Isotherm behaviour has been studied in two different scenarios. The first was to investigate the use of super critical methane adsorption in the determination of an activated carbon pore size distribution (PSD). It was found that this method was viable in the determination of the PSD in only the micropore range. However it was also shown that the use of absolute amounts adsorbed in the fitting of the PSD results in a better estimation of the accessible volume of and adsorption cell compared with the helium expansion method. Isotherms were also studied for polar compounds on highly graphitised surfaces. Isotherms were shown to be sensitive to the type, amount and configuration of functional groups. It was also shown that currently used interaction models for water adsorption on graphite are inadequate and cannot reproduce any feature of experimental isotherms. A clear and unambiguous derivation of the heat of adsorption equations are presented together with equations for the combination of individual simulation isotherms with a PSD to give the heat of adsorption for a solid. Heat of adsorption behaviour is presented for model carbon surfaces and porous solids and their irreducible features examined. The final large constituent of this study is the investigation of the heat capacity of adsorbed layers for argon and polar compounds. The molecular origins of the interesting heat capacity behaviour are clearly demonstrated and for the case of polar compounds are shown to be a clear indicator in the type of clustering occurring on the surface.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158757</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Long Timescale Path Integral Molecular Dynamics from Equations of Motion.</field><field name="creator">Gladwin, Benjamin Angus</field><field name="description">Simulation of molecular systems is often limited by the time scale over which they can be analysed. Traditionally, analysis of these systems is done using atom based models and a process called Molecular Dynamics. In this method the initial position and momentum of each atom is specified and an equation of motion, such as Newton&#146;s equation, is integrated forward in time. In the last several years Molecular Dynamics has become a standard laboratory tool and has helped to bridge the knowledge gap between molecular structure and biological function. Despite its widespread use, accurate simulation using the initial value formulation of traditional Molecular Dynamics is limited computationally to the investigation of small molecules or short timescales of approximately tens of nanoseconds. Many interesting biological and chemical processes take place over times which can be tens of seconds and this large disparity of timescales represents one of the most significant limitations facing simulation. A surprisingly small body of work has focussed on techniques which recast the search for dynamic trajectories as a boundary value problem. Addressing the dynamics in this sense, allows a broad overview of the whole trajectory to be obtained using a course sampling of points independent of the systems natural timescale. From an experimental viewpoint, this approach requires specification of initial and final positions of the atoms, and an estimate of the timescale. These properties of the system are more accessible using laboratory techniques such as X-ray crystallography. Any system in which the atoms initial and final positions are known and the transition path is required is well suited to this technique. This includes reaction mechanics, where the educts and products are known, or functional molecular machinery such as molecular motors which undergo well defined conformational changes. Boundary condition techniques are based on the least action approach proposed by Hamilton which has been used in classical mechanics as a means for determining particle trajectories. The majority of existing techniques use conservation of energy at each time in the trajectory as a measure to determine the suitability of a particular path. Conservation of energy represents a necessary condition for a dynamic path but is not, unfortunately, sufficient to guarantee that the path will satisfy equations of motion. In a molecular setting, the least action principle has been recast in terms of the deviation of a molecules path from a classical Newtonian trajectory. By defining an approximate long time scale trajectory for each atom in terms of some adjustable initial set of parameters, it becomes possible to calculate a classical action for the approximate path. The deviation from a classical Newtonian path can be measured and the trajectory can be iteratively improved. In this form, a resulting zero action path will conserve energy at each point in the path and satisfy the classical Newton&#146;s equation of motion. In real biological systems, the effect of solvents play an important role in the behaviour of the molecule. Ideally, this effect would be accounted for by explicit modeling of each solvent molecule however, this is very computationally expensive. One way of cheaply accounting for the influence of the solvent is to use stochastic dynamics and Langevin&#146;s equation of motion. In stochastic dynamics the energy of the system is only conserved as the long term average and therefore arguments which utilise moment to moment energy conservation are no longer valid. One outcome of this thesis has been the development of a new approach in the stochastic setting which is analogous to molecular dynamics using least action. This technique is developed in the spirit of the classical boundary condition based molecular dynamics and accounts for solvent effects. The overall purpose of this work has been the development of techniques to find atomic trajectories with minimum deviation from those which are governed by equations of motion. These approaches provide coarse grained approximate trajectories for systems over arbitrarily long time scales, and in conjunction with existing methods allow for detailed investigation of bio-molecular processes. Implementation of this work will aid in the understanding of mechanisms that underlie molecular transitions in biochemical systems and provide details which are less easily accessible using experimental techniques. Future applications may include specifically, the investigation of processes such as ion transfer and the motion of binding sites for proteins and ligands.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158758</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seeds of opportunity: Towards a sustainable, consultative and ethically justified use of genetically modified plants</field><field name="creator">Carter, Lucy</field><field name="description">Public debate about the ethical acceptability of genetically modified (GM) plants in general and GM food in particular, is highly polarized. Proponents of GM products passionately argue that novel gene technologies have the potential to contribute to more efficient agricultural processes, promote environmental sustainability, and curb malnutrition in the developing world. Opponents of novel plant biotechnologies, counter with equal vehemence, that GM products are unnatural, potentially harmful to humans, and capable of catastrophic environmental injury. As more uses for GM products are realised, and investment in plant biotechnologies continues to grow, both groups have stepped up advocacy of their respective views in academic and public forums. Both sides continue to be at loggerheads with one another, in trying to force the public to choose between their two opposing views. This research discusses in detail the most prominent arguments put forward in favour of, and in opposition to, the development and use of novel plant biotechnologies. It covers developing and industrialized contexts and describes the most likely applications of GM products within these contexts. The principal approach used in this analysis is one that embraces a spirit of pragmatism in its commitment to moving forward through the traditional impasse in which ethical and policy debates often finds themselves. This project sets out to clarify the issues, explore the most salient of these, and make suggestions about the best ways to move the debate forward. Early on in this work it is established that within specified constraints, novel plant technologies have the capacity to make a substantial contribution to agricultural practices, the environment, and the wider community. These assumptions are carried throughout the project and serve as points of departure in discussions about the ethical concerns raised by the application of novel genetic technologies to plants. One of the aims of this research is to produce a piece of work that can inform future policy decisions related to agricultural and environmental applications of GM technologies in Australia and elsewhere. I hope that the discussion presented here goes some way to achieving this goal and that it provides a coherent and plausible articulation of the issues.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158759</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antimicrobial Resistance Mechanisms in Canine Multidrug-Resistant Escherichia coli and Enterobacter spp.</field><field name="creator">Sidjabat, Hanna</field><field name="description">Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Enterobacteriaceae exhibiting resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins have recently emerged as a cause of opportunistic infections in hospitalised dogs. At the University of Queensland Veterinary Teaching Hospital (UQVTH) and other referral veterinary hospitals in Brisbane Australia, MDR E. coli (MDREC) and MDR Enterobacter spp were the most commonly isolated strains. Plasmid-mediated resistance genes and clonality were determined for 11 MDREC and 10 MDR Enterobacter spp. isolates associated with opportunistic infections in hospitalised dogs. Phenotypic (broth microdilution and disc susceptibility testing, modified disc diffusion testing and IEF for ~Iactamases) and genotypic tests (pCR and sequencing, plasmid analysis and Southern blot hybridisation, bacterial conjugation and transformation) were used to identify and localise specific antimicrobial resistance genes to plasmids. The clonality of the isolates was investigated by PFGE and plasmid analysis. MDREC isolates could be divided into two clonal groups (CG 1 and 2) with distinct PFGE and plasmid profiles. In all MDREC stmins, resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins was imparted by an AmpC ~Iactamase gene, blacMY_7 which was located on a nonconjugative ~93 kb plasmid that did not contain any other known resistance genes. There was a marked difference in the distribution of plasmid-mediated resistance genes between CG 1 and CG 2. The identified resistance genes located on ~170 kb plasmid in MOREC CG 1 strains were blaTEM, catAl and class I integron-associated genes (sull and dfrA17-aadA5). In MDREC CG 2 strains, a second -93 kb plasmid contained biaTEM and co-transferred resistance to sulfonamide/trimethoprim, tetracycline and streptomycin. This plasmid also contained a class I integron, but the gene cassette could not be identified, except for the presence of dfrV in a single isolate. Canine MDR Enterobacter spp. clinical isolates were genotypically diverse based on PFGE; and belonged to either Enterobacter cloacae or Enterobacter hormaechei based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Of the ten canine Enterobacter spp., nine isolates carried plasmid-mediated blasHv.12 on -140 kb plasmid and the remaining one isolate possessed blacMY_2 on a ~93 kb plasmid. The blasHV_12-carrying plasmid also co-transferred resistance to chloramphenicol (cauV), streptomycin/spectinomycin (aadA2), gentamicin, tetracycline, sulfonamide/trimethoprim; whereas, the blacMY.2-carrying plasmid did not contain any known resistance genes to other antimicrobials. Both blaSHV.12 and blaCM'{.2 carrying plasmids were both readily transmissible. This is the first report of plasmid-mediated blaCM'{.7 in MDREC and blaSHV'12 and blaCM&#165;.2 in Enterobacter spp. isolated from animals. The fact that the blaSHV.12 carrying plasmid can transfer readily and could be co-selected by several traditional antimicrobials provides an exceptional threat of rapid spread of this plasmid between bacteria causing extraintestinal infections in both humans and animals. In contrast, the blaCM'{'2 or blaCM'{.7 carrying plasmids will only be spread when there is selection pressure created by use of expandedspectrum cephalosporins or broad spectrum ~-Iactam/clavulanic acid combinations. A I-year infection control study was conducted to limit further occurrence of extraintestinal infections and determine the molecular epidemiology of MDREC, and, to a lesser extent, MDR Enterobacter spp. emergence and spread within UQVTH. Selective media were used to obtain MDR coliform isolates from the hospital environment and rectal swabs of hospitalised dogs and hospital employees. Furthermore, a multiplex PCR was designed to identify the MDR coliform isolates as E. coli, and to determine their clonality. A subset of representative isolates was characterised by PFGE, plasmid analysis and serotyping. Similar to the MDREC clinical cases, only two COs were identified. The clinical infections were therefore likely to be endogenous and influenced by prolonged hospitalisation periods and concurrent antimicrobial therapy. Direct, dog-to-dog, faecal-oral transmission was likely to have occurred as well as exposure to a contaminated environment for MDREC CG I and Enterobacter spp. strains. More importantly, the isolation of MDREC CG 2 from two hospital employees showed the possibility ofMDREC transfer between dogs and humans via the faecal-oral route. The clinical cases caused by MDREC and MDREC spread within hospitalised dogs and the hospital environment were therefore resultant from clonal dissemination oftwo distinct clonal lineages. A human clinical MDREC strain isolated from a Brisbane patient with a urmary tract infection Was shown to be genotypically related to MDREC CG I and possessed the same blaCMY.7 plasmid, confirming that dog-to-human, or indeed, human-to-dog MDREC transmission, can also be hypothesised for MDREC CG 1 strains. The level of blaCMY.7 RNA expression and plasmid copy number were determined for representative canine and human MDREC CG 1 and CG 2 strains. It was compared with relative expression in Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium (S. typhimurium) strain 100 and laboratory E. coli strains containing the native blaCMY.7 plasmid or the cloned blaCM'{.7 gene plus the transcriptional start site. The constitutive expression level per gene copy of blaCM'{.7 in canine MDREC CG 1 (-1 copy per cell) and CG 2 (-2 copies per cell) Was 100-fold and ISO-fold greater than chromosomal ampC expression in the C. freundii wild-type, respectively. The constitutive expression per copy number of cloned blaCMY.7 insert (-15 copies) was IS-fold lower than corresponding expression in both the E. coli laboratory strain containing the blacMY.7 native plasmid (-2 copies) and the original clinical donor strain. The constitutive expression data correlated with the expanded-spectrum cephalosporin MICs and high-level AmpC expression did not compromise the growth rate of E. coli. Typical ExPEC virulence genes were identified in the three human, 25 canme and 6 environmental MDREC isolates. Regardless of sample source, ExPEC VFs were distributed according to clonality and phylotype. MDREC CG 1 strains belonged to phylogenetic group A (typical commensal E. coli phylotype) and possessed only iutA and traT; whereas MDREC CG 2 were all phylogenetic group D (typical ExPEC phylotype) and possessed iutA, ibeA, fimH, and kpsAfT K5, which are important virulence genes in extraintestinal infections. The fact that MDREC CG 2 possessed type 1 :fimbriae and flagella in comparison to CG 1 isolates may contribute to colonisation ability and virulence, both in the gastrointestinal tract and extraintestinal sites, such as bladder. This is confirmed in three different mouse models (gastrointestinal colonisation, extraintestinal virulence and urinary tract infection) in which CG 1 and CG 2 index strains were compared. Both CGs of MDREC strains isolated from extraintestinal infections in dogs were not only important sources of plasmid-mediated antimicrobial resistance genes, but strong evidence was obtained supporting their ability to colonise and cause extraintestinal infection in humans. Dogs therefore represent an important reservoir of MDR coliforms that cause opportunistic infections and the transfer of strains and/or their plasmid-mediated resistance genes, particularly AmpC j3-lactamase and ESBL genes commonly occurs between humans and dogs. This finding has important public health implications and must be considered in treatment and prevention strategies in human and veterinary settings.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158760</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental systems analysis as an aid to policy development, application and auditing</field><field name="creator">Hill, Richard J.</field><field name="description">Environmental management in modern industry entails much more than simply measuring the level of contaminants at the discharge point of a chimney stack or pipeline and operating within defined licence limits. It involves: 1) Understanding the environmental risks associated with the industrial operation; 2) Quantifying the environmental assets at risk; 3) Evaluating the environmental challenge from the industry (determining the likely effect of particular emission levels on different environments); 4) Monitoring the condition of environmental assets in response to this challenge; 5) Devising appropriate remedial action where necessary. This study aimed to provide a rigorous and effective framework for decision making concerning vegetated landscapes surrounding industrial premises, particularly those associated with emissions of pollutants to air. Three Alcoa of Australia managed facilities in Victoria were used to develop and test the procedures, namely a coastal site at Point Henry, Geelong, a hinterland forest and heath site at Anglesea and a coastal heath site at Portland. The three facilities were involved in the aluminium smelting industry and the major atmospheric emissions were gaseous and particulate fluorides and sulfur dioxide. Analyses of vegetation distribution and condition were undertaken in order to establish whether the industrial activities at the three sites could be identified as the causes of changes in vegetation. A geographic information system (GIS) was implemented at each facility, to contain cadastral information as well as records of the physical environment and plant and animal species occurrences and condition, where appropriate. The GIS was used to create a surface of vegetation condition over the area of interest at the time of assessment and then over time to evaluate vegetation change and relationship to meteorological and production data. Baseline vegetation condition was established for each facility using large-scale high quality aerial photography and multi-spectral imagery. The photography for each site contained large amounts of latent information on vegetation distribution and condition. When properly rectified and geo-referenced, the images became accessible and open to manipulation within the GIS. At each of the three sites investigated, image classes were selected that provided appropriate detail for the vegetation type. In effect the image became a surrogate of the vegetation frozen in time and space. The ability to extract information on past vegetation condition was shown to be a very valuable asset providing the opportunity to generate new contemporaneous data to augment poor or lost historical data. The process was illustrated by developing vegetation change maps and trend information using past and current photography and limited historical field data. A verified emission model was applied to two of the facilities (Anglesea and Portland) to predict emission effects over the vegetated areas. These were used to evaluate current vegetation condition and change in terms of industrial challenge and other change agencies known or suspected. In each case, further developments of the model were required in order to achieve acceptable predictions of known atmospheric and air pollutant conditions. The investigations at Anglesea demonstrated the importance of fine-scale topographic description and meteorological modelling in order to reconcile modelled and observed environmental conditions in hilly coastal terrain. At Portland, the study revealed the importance of marine aerosols in the distribution and deposition of fluoride in the vicinity of the source. Within the broad framework of vegetation type and general condition at Anglesea and Portland, differences at the micro-scale of individual plants and clumps of plants were examined using multi-spectral imagery. Here differences in image characteristics that related to increased pigmentation and loss of chlorophyll in leaves and increased amounts of dead tissue on plants were evaluated. The change agents for the detected differences within sets and between sets of imagery were analysed and again shown to be mainly non-industrial. Only at Portland did atmospheric emissions from the aluminium smelter play a role at some locations, and then only because the effect was being reinforced by other factors (lack of burning and drought). At Portland, population data for associated fauna and an orchid were examined in relation to the baseline vegetation condition, vegetation change and industrial impact. The distribution and welfare of these species were shown to be generally dependent on vegetation condition and other non-industrial factors. If the vegetation overall was maintained in a condition of vigorous growth and structural diversity, it could be expected that specific dependant flora and fauna would thrive within it. The exception was the orchid, which was shown to be sensitive to emissions and could only thrive in its natural habitat in the vicinity of the smelter if protected by screening vegetation or nurtured by an intensive set of cultural practices that were developed as a result of this study.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300804 Environmental Impact Assessment</field><field name="subject">300800 Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">300801 Environmental Management and Rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Alcoa</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158761</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Life in a corridor": An archaeological investigation of the Diamantina channel country - a western Queensland corridor</field><field name="creator">Simmons, Anthony</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">2101 Archaeology</field><field name="subject">Archaeology -- Queensland -- Channel Country</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Antiquities -- Queensland -- Channel Country</field><field name="subject">Archaeology -- Queensland -- Channel Country</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158762</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms involved in functional interactions between the Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1 and &amp;mu; opioid receptor</field><field name="creator">Vetter, Irina</field><field name="description">Peripheral sensitisation contributes to the development of persistent pain and involves numerous cellular processes. An important receptor in this process is the vanilloid receptor 1 or transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1). TRPV1 is a nociceptive calcium (Ca2+) channel that is activated by capsaicin, the pungent constituent of chilli peppers, as well as protons and heat. TRPV1 is mainly expressed on nociceptive peripheral neurons and appears to be critical in the development of inflammatory and neuropathic hyperalgesia. Several receptors, including the NGF receptor trkA, the prostaglandin receptor EP1 and the insulin receptor, may functionally interact with TRPV1 to effect sensitisation of TRPV1 in inflammation or neuropathy. Although sensitisation of TRPV1 responses is important, the concept of preventing sensitisation may also be important in modulating signalling through TRPV1. However, few studies have investigated pathways that interact with TRPV1 to prevent sensitisation. As a prototypical G-protein coupled receptor that produces analgesic effects upon activation, one such potential modulator is the &#956; opioid receptor or MOP. This thesis thus aims to provide insight into the pathways involved in putative functional interactions between TRPV1 and MOP. This thesis describes confirmation of co-expression of TRPV1 and MOP in a substantial proportion of TRPV1-expressing cultured adult rat dorsal root ganglion neurons using immunofluorescence studies, thus forming the basis for a functional interaction of the nociceptive TRPV1 and antinociceptive MOP in neuronal cells. However, owing to the heterogeneity of TRPV1 and MOP expression in neuronal subsets, a human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK) cell line stably expressing TRPV1 and MOP was generated to enable study of the pathways and mechanisms involved in putative functional interactions between the receptors. The effect of the MOP agonist morphine on TRPV1 function was assessed by measurement of TRPV1-mediated Ca2+ responses in Fluo-3-loaded cells using a fluorescent microplate reader. Although morphine did not affect unpotentiated TRPV1 responses, based on the observation that opioids are particularly effective in inflammation, but ineffective in neuropathies, the ability of morphine to inhibit TRPV1 responses sensitised by cAMP-dependent PKA as well as PKC and insulin was assessed. Pre-treatment with morphine inhibited TRPV1-mediated capsaicin responses potentiated by the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin. However, TRPV1-mediated Ca2+ responses potentiated by the direct PKA activator 8-Br-cAMP, the PKC activator Phorbol-12- myristate-13-acetate and ethanol were not modulated by morphine. The results presented here indicate that the MOP agonist morphine acts via inhibition of adenylate cyclase to inhibit PKA-potentiated TRPV1 responses. In light of increased PKA activity in inflammation, MOP-mediated inhibition of TRPV1 responses sensitised by cAMPdependent PKA may be of particular relevance to inflammatory hyperalgesia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158764</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MULTIVARIATE SIMULATION OF CHANNEL IRON ORE DEPOSITS AT BUNGAROO AND YANDICOOGINA, WESTERN AUSTRALIA</field><field name="creator">Boyle, Cameron McLaren Wilson</field><field name="description">Geostatistical conditional simulation has wide potential applications in the iron ore industry and is the favoured tool to assess variability and risk. Multivariate relationships are important in such simulation, for example between Fe and impurities such as Al2O3, SiO2 and P. Turning bands has been the main conditional simulation algorithm used in the Western Australian iron ore industry. In this thesis a more recent approach using minimum/maximum autocorrelation factors (MAF) and sequential Gaussian simulation (SGS) are used together and performance comparisons are made with turning bands at Yandicoogina, a channel iron ore deposit (CID) in Western Australia. MAF-SGS and turning bands algorithms both performed well in simulating Fe, SiO2, Al2O3 and P at Yandicoogina. Extensive checking of simulations showed both approaches could reasonably reproduce multivariate statistics and spatial continuity of composites including means, variances, histograms, quantile-quantile plots, scatter plots and variography in normal scores and data space, as well as in MAF space for the MAFSGS approach. MAF generated from transformed composites were largely uncorrelated and able to be considered independent for variography and simulation. Later back transformation from MAF space to normal scores space then to data space successfully reintroduced joint relationships seen in the conditioning data. While the MAF-SGS approach needs additional transformations compared with turning bands, a linear model of coregionalisation and hence the modelling of cross semivariograms is not required. If there are a high number of variables then construction of a linear model of coregionalisation becomes more difficult and the MAF approach may be preferred. In this study four variables were considered and a linear model of coregionalisation could be built. Turning bands transformations are from data space to normal scores space only, with no need to calculate or check any decorrelated factors. The two main methods currently used in the mining industry for determining optimum drillhole spacing with the use of conditional simulation were compared at the Test Pit area of the Bungaroo channel iron ore deposit, also in Western Australia. The &amp;quot simulation-simulation&amp;quot method generates precisions for various drillhole spacing using two stages of simulation, whereas the &amp;quot simulation-estimation&amp;quot approach calculates expected relative errors for different spacings via a simulation stage followed by an estimation step. Clear differences exist between the relative errors from the simulation-estimation method and the precisions calculated from the simulation-simulation method. The simulationestimation method appears more insensitive to the grid spacing with only moderate improvements in relative error as the drillhole spacing is tightened. The simulationsimulation method shows more marked improvement in precision with closer spacing and appears more realistic in this study. Al2O3 is the main variable to consider at Bungaroo when choosing a suitable drillhole spacing. SiO2 grades of composites are mainly below the SiO2 cut off grade for ore whereas the mean Al2O3 is grade is quite close to the Al2O3 cut off grade for ore. Hence although SiO2 has higher variability, it is not as critical as Al2O3 for determination of drillhole spacing. Fe and P have greater spatial continuity than Al2O3 and SiO2 and do not require such close drillhole spacing. Fifteen percent precision, based on a volume representing a quarter&#146;s production and using the simulation-simulation method, may be regarded as acceptable for mine planning purposes. A resource evaluation drilling spacing of 150m along strike and 50m across strike appears appropriate for a precision of less than 15% for a quarterly mining volume in determining Al2O3 grade at Bungaroo.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158765</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DEVELOPING ONTOLOGIES IN THE BIOLOGICAL DOMAIN</field><field name="creator">Castro, Alexander Garcia</field><field name="description">The development of &amp;quot omic&amp;quot technologies and its applications into biological sciences has increased the need for an integrated view of bio-related information. The flood of information as well as the technological availability has made it necessary for researchers to share resources and join efforts more than ever in order to understand the function of genes, proteins and biological systems in general. Integrating biological information has been addressed mainly from a syntactical perspective. However, as we enter into the post-genomic era integration has acquired a meaning more related to the capacity of inference (finding hidden information) and sharebility in large web-based information systems. Ontologies play a central role when addressing both syntactic and semantic aspects of information integration. The purpose of this research has been to investigate how the biological community could develop those highly needed ontologies in a way that ensures both, maintainability and usability. Although the need for ontologies, as well as the benefits of having them, is obvious; it has proven to be difficult for the biological community not only to develop but also to effectively use them. Why? How should they be developed in such a way that they are maintainable and usable by existing and novel information systems? A feasible methodology elucidated from the careful study whilst developing biological ontologies is proposed. Methodological extensions gathered from the acquired experience are also presented. Throughout the chapters of this thesis diverse integrative approaches have also been analysed from different perspectives; a workflow-based solution to the integration of analytical tools was consequently proposed. This made it possible to better understand the need for welldefined semantics in biological information systems as well as the importance of a thoughtful understanding of the relationship between the semantic structure and the syntactic scaffold that should ultimately host the former. The role of communities in the construction of biological ontologies as well as the argumentative structure that takes place during the development and maintenance of them have been extensively studied in this thesis. What is the role of the domain expert when developing ontologies within the biological domain? Different scenarios in which ontologies were developed have been studied in order to answer this question. The relationship between domain experts and knowledge engineers was analyzed during the development of loosely centralised ontologies. As a consequence of those direct experiences developing ontologies a viable use for concept maps supporting collaboration and annotation was anticipated; consequent software developments are also part of this investigation. From this investigation several conclusions have been drawn, one of them with a particular significance is the relevance of collaboration between two asymmetric, yet not antagonist, communities; computer scientists and biologists may work and achieve results in different ways, nevertheless both communities hold valuable information that could be of mutual benefit. Within the context of biological ontologies &amp;quot Romeo and Juliet&amp;quot proved to be an apt metaphor that illustrates not only the importance of the collaboration, but also how we may avoid heading towards &amp;quot A hundred years of solitude&amp;quot .</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158766</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors Associated with Continuity and Change in Tobacco Use Among Women During Young Adulthood</field><field name="creator">McDermott, Liane</field><field name="description">Tobacco smoking is a recognised risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and for a range of other cancers, diseases and conditions. For women, smoking also has detrimental effects on reproductive outcomes, including decreased fertility, pregnancy complications and poorer birth outcomes. While the prevalence of smoking among women is declining in many developed countries, smoking prevalence remains high among women in young adulthood. A review of literature examining factors associated with women&#146;s smoking found a wide range of factors influencing smoking behaviour, including nicotine dependence and demographic, psychosocial, lifestyle, social and environmental factors. Young women&#146;s smoking behaviour has also been related to various life-stage transitions, such as changes in living arrangements, and marriage and parenthood. Young adulthood has been identified as a critical period in establishing patterns of subsequent tobacco use. Prospective studies have shown that the progression to regular smoking continues from adolescence to young adulthood, and that there is instability in smoking behaviour during the young adult years. These prospective studies have largely focussed on the development of smoking behaviour from adolescence to early adulthood, and generally reported the findings for both women and men. Less attention has been paid to the smoking patterns of young adult women and the influences on their smoking behaviour during this stage of their lives. This knowledge is important in order to identify opportunities for targeted tobacco control interventions and to identify the risk factors that need to be addressed through public health policy initiatives, programs and campaigns, to reduce tobacco smoking among young women. This thesis adopted a life-stage perspective to understand continuity and change in young women&#146;s smoking behaviour as they experienced events such as leaving home, employment or going to college or university, romantic relationships and marriage, and parenthood. The main aims of this thesis were to explore in more depth the possible influences on young women&#146;s smoking behaviour as they experienced different lifestage transitions; to examine, prospectively, patterns, trends and transitions in smoking behaviour among women during young adulthood; and, to identify the factors associated with continuity and change in smoking behaviour. These aims were achieved through a qualitative study of young women who were participants in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women&#146;s Health (ALSWH), and through analyses of data from the 1996, 2000 and 2003 surveys of ALSWH young women. The qualitative study reported in Chapter 3 found that the social context of smoking (socialising with other smokers, drinking alcohol and going to bars and clubs) was perceived to be a predominant influence on smoking from the time young women left home until they settled into a committed relationship or started their own family. Stress was also identified as an important factor as they experienced such lifestyle changes. They reported an increased sensitivity to the negative aspects of smoking after turning 21, and around their mid 20&#146;s became concerned about the addictive nature of cigarettes. Motherhood was seen to carry increased responsibilities to protect children from passive smoking and there was a perceived importance of positive role modelling to protect children from becoming smokers themselves. The prospective study reported in Chapter 4 found that 14% of young women initially aged 18-23 years continued smoking over a seven-year period, 5% remained exsmokers and 59% were never smokers. There was instability in smoking behaviour for around 21% who either quit, initiated and quit, re-started, or adopted smoking. The most consistent association with continuity and change in smoking behaviour was the recent use of illicit drugs, which was a predictor of current and continued smoking, adoption and experimentation of smoking, and a predictor of re-starting to smoke. The findings reported in Chapter 4 also showed that transitions in smoking behaviour among young women were strongly related to major life-stage transitions. Being married or getting married was significantly associated with never smoking and with quitting smoking. There were also significant associations between parenthood and smoking transitions, however, these relationships were less clear: being a parent was associated with current smoking as well as with quitting smoking. Not working or studying was associated with re-starting smoking and lower educational qualifications were associated with current and continued smoking. Of the psychosocial and demographic variables considered, high levels of perceived stress and living in a rural or remote area were the only other factors strongly associated with smoking. The study reported in Chapter 5 examined transitions in smoking behaviour among young women who were occasional smokers. Over a seven-year period, approximately half of the women who were occasional smokers at the baseline survey stopped smoking by their mid to late twenties, one-quarter changed to daily smoking and the remainder reported continuing non-daily smoking. Recent use of illicit drugs was predictive of becoming a daily or a non-daily smoker, while alcohol consumption was associated with being a non-daily smoker only. Life-stage transitions such as relationship commitment, marriage and becoming a parent increased the odds of cessation. Compared to stopping smoking, the change to daily smoking was significantly associated with having a trade, apprenticeship, certificate or diploma. More than half of the women who changed from occasional smoking to daily smoking had previously smoked daily, suggesting that for them occasional smoking had been a phase of reduced smoking rather than a progression towards daily smoking. There were no significant associations with depression and perceived stress in the multivariable analysis. The final prospective study reported in Chapter 6 examined transitions in smoking behaviour among young women who were daily smokers. Over a seven-year period, one-quarter of baseline daily smokers reduced and maintained a lower level of smoking, 12% stopped smoking, 23% maintained or increased their baseline level of smoking and the remaining 40% moved in and out of these categories of behaviour. Those who reduced smoking were most likely to have been heavy smokers at baseline and to have used illicit drugs in the past year, compared to those who stopped smoking. The strongest predictor of smoking cessation among those who were initially daily smokers was a reported reduction to non-daily smoking in the survey before they reported having quit. Getting married also increased the odds of cessation, while illicit drug use reduced the odds of cessation. No significant associations were found between these smoking transitions and the psychosocial factors considered. From the prospective analyses reported in this thesis, lifestyle and life-stage factors emerged as more important determinants of smoking behaviour, than the psychosocial factors examined in the studies. Life-stage transitions (changes in educational and vocational factors, marriage and parenthood) were significantly associated with changes in smoking behaviour, generally in the directions of reductions or cessation. The overall pattern of findings from the studies suggests that tobacco control interventions should focus on smoking prevention and cessation programmes when there is instability in young women&#146;s smoking behaviour, as they make the transition to adult roles and responsibilities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158767</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Disarmament Diplomacy: the Role of Non-Governmental Organisations in International Arms Control</field><field name="creator">Barrow, Kristie</field><field name="description">The rise to prominence of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) as international political actors is one of the most remarkable features of the post- Cold War world. NGOs are now participating in almost every facet of international political life with unprecedented levels of access and influence. In addition to growing activity in their traditional service-orientated roles of development and welfare provision, NGOs are frequently engaging in political advocacy. Indeed, international advocacy NGOs are becoming increasingly active and vocal players in international decision-making fora, and making forays into what was traditionally the state-centric arena of security, including arms control. While realists claim that NGOs have no substantial role in decision-making in issues of international security, it is the contention of this thesis that NGOs are in fact playing a useful and increasingly prominent role in international affairs. Through their ability to influence governments by lobbying and advocacy, international advocacy NGOs are increasingly able to pressure states to adhere to certain norms of behaviour which constrain state action in situations of conflict and warfare. This thesis demonstrates that international advocacy NGOs are able to propel issues onto the international political agenda, to participate in multilateral fora for decision-making, and to pressure states to adhere to norms of behaviour. In this thesis these NGO activities are examined in relation to international campaigns against landmines, biological weapons and nuclear testing. The impact of NGO activities varies according to the different issues being considered in arms control. Yet taken overall, the activities of advocacy NGOs in the field of arms control suggest a noteworthy trend towards greater involvement and integration of NGOs in the security sector of international politics in the post- Cold War period.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158768</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EFFECTS OF VARIOUS CARBON SOURCES ON THE PERFORMANCE AND PROPERTIES OF DENITRIFIYING SLUDGE</field><field name="creator">Paxman, Jason Trevor</field><field name="description">Biological denitrification is one of the most cost effective and widely used methods for nitrogen removal in municipal wastewater treatment plants. Under new stricter South East Queensland effluent guidelines the performance of wastewater treatment plants has to improve significantly to meet effluent total N restrictions of 5 mg N/L. The organic carbon contained in municipal wastewater that was utilised to carry out denitrification is often not sufficient to meet these stricter guidelines. As such the addition of an external carbon source is becoming a viable option to increase the COD (chemical oxygen demand) supply to a treatment plant to enhance denitrification. The choice of carbon source has long been a question of cost and performance. Often methanol has been the preferred choice of operators because of its relatively low cost per carbon mole, and the stability it provides with long term use. However other carbon sources are attractive in some cases because of their comparatively low cost, their ability to enhance denitrification. Such carbon sources include, among others, molasses and sludge hydrolysate. This thesis investigated the long-term effects of methanol, molasses and sludge hydrolysate on the performance and properties of denitrifying sludge when used as external carbon sources. Studies were carried out on both full-scale wastewater treatment plants and lab-scale reactor systems fed with real wastewater. The denitrification performance as well as a number of key properties of the sludge&#146;s receiving an external carbon source were monitored and compared to those of a reference system. An effort was made to design fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH) probes using the stable isotope probing (SIP) method for the measurement of the entire denitrifying community. In addition, the impact of various storage conditions on the maintenance of denitrification activities was investigated. The key outcomes are summarised below. Ethanol as an alternative carbon source for methanol adapted denitrifiers At the South Caboolture Water Reclamation Plant a 2 sludge post-denitrification reactor is used to polish the effluent before discharge, with methanol used as the primary external carbon source. The capability of the bio-films to denitrify with methanol, ethanol and acetate as sole or dual carbon sources was monitored for a period of one year using batch tests. On average the highest rates of denitrification were achieved using methanol, however ethanol supported denitrification rates were very similar to those with methanol (&amp;gt90%). Acetate supported denitrification varied considerably during the study period being as low as 15% of the average rate achieved with methanol, however after 2 weeks of ethanol addition the acetate supported denitrification rate had increased to be identical to the rate achieved with ethanol. The experimental results suggest that three functional bacterial groups were present within the microbial community of the biofilms, with the dominating group being able to use both methanol and ethanol as carbon sources for denitrification. The results of this study indicate that the use of ethanol as a short-term replacement for methanol in times of methanol unavailability is a sound operating option. Long term addition of molasses and fermented molasses: Impact on nitrogen removal and activated sludge properties The long term addition of molasses and fermented molasses were investigated for their impact on nitrogen removal and other operating parameters. The study was conducted in a bench scale SBR reactor operating as single sludge pre-denitrification system in parallel with a control reactor. The results of the study showed that fermented molasses was the better carbon source for enhancing nitrogen removal, removing 8.69 mg N/L more than the control reactor receiving no external carbon at a COD addition of 100 mg TCOD per litre wastewater added. The long term addition of fermented molasses led to periods of bad settling however resulting in high SVI values throughout the addition period which appeared to be the result of the enumeration of filamentous organisms. Biomass washout was a feature of the long term addition of both fermented and non fermented molasses as a result of the poor settling. Long term addition of molasses/fermented molasses resulted in adaptation of the biomass, resulting in the biomass having an increased ability to denitrify with acetate, butyrate and wastewater COD. The use of either fermented and non-fermented molasses caused problems with the sludge settling characteristics of activated sludge in the lab scale SBR reactor. Long term addition of sludge hydrolysate: Impact on nitrogen removal and activated sludge properties The long term effect of the addition of sludge hydrolysate on the nitrogen removal and other operating parameters was investigated in this study. The study was conducted in a bench scale SBR reactor operating as a single sludge pre-denitrification system in parallel with a control reactor. The liquid from a rotary sludge thickener (RST) at a full-scale wastewater treatment plant was used as the hydrolysate. The RST liquid was found to contain a large fraction of volatile fatty acids, with acetate being the dominant species. The long term addition of the sludge hydrolysate was found to enhance biological denitrification with a removal rate of 3.64 mg N/L with a hydrolysate addition of 40 mg COD per litre wastewater added. During the long term addition of the hydrolysate a decrease in the nitrification performance led to an accumulation of ammonium up to 30 mg NH4-N/L. It was unclear if this was a result of the hydrolysate addition. A period of 2 weeks was required for the nitrification performance to return to normal and the excess ammonium removed. The formation of pin flocs with poor settling was also a feature of long term hydrolysate addition which is potentially related to the addition of acetate in the hydrolysate. It would appear that high VFA containing sludge hydrolysates would make a better short term carbon source, in preference to long term addition. Impact of aerobic, anoxic, intermittently aerated and anaerobic storage conditions on denitrification activity of activated sludge The storage of excess sludge has been shown to be a reliable method for reducing the size of treatment plants. Under storage however the activity of bacteria can deteriorate. The rate at which this deterioration occurs is an important factor in determining the method of storage applied. This study investigated the impact of four storage conditions (aerobic, anoxic, intermittent aeration and anaerobic) on the activity of denitrifiers. The aerobic storage conditions yielded the highest VSS decay rate of 0.028 d-1, followed by the intermittent aeration (0.020 d-1), anoxic (0.012 d-1) and anaerobic (0.009 d-1) storage conditions. Storage under intermittently aerobic conditions resulted in the lowest denitrification rates measured in the study, with a maximum nitrate reduction rate of 4.97 mg NO3-N/gVSS/h compared to the seed sludge nitrate reduction rate of 9.62 mg NO3- N/gVSS/h. The storage of sludge under anoxic conditions yielded the most stable denitrification rates with a nitrate reduction rate almost identical to the rates measured on day 1 (6.39 mg NO3-N/gVSS/h) even after 21 days (6.97 mg NO3-N/gVSS/h). For each storage condition tested an unusual trend over the first 5 days was measured with the denitrification rates all increasing. After day 5 the maximum denitrification rates decreased with the rate of decrease varying dependant on the storage conditions. Modified 15N-SIP method to investigate &#145;natural&#146; denitrifiers in activated sludge using carbon sources contained in wastewater 15N-SIP is a SIP method which can be applied to complex microbial systems which cannot be targeted using a carbon based SIP approach. A methodology was developed for this study, which involved (1) identifying a method that could remove the ammonium contained in raw wastewater, while retaining a significant amount of the natural soluble COD to provide an 14N-ammonium free wastewater feed source for the SIP incubation, (2) the incubation of a fresh sample of activated sludge from a full scale wastewater treatment plant with 15NH4 15NO3 to ensure only 15N was supplied to actively growing bacteria under anoxic conditions, and (3) to carry out RNA SIP because it is considered a more responsive biomarker that labels active bacteria more efficiently than DNA SIP. The development of an ion-exchange column for treating the wastewater to remove the 14N-Ammonium while retaining 50% of the volatile fatty acids to provide a natural carbon feed source for the SIP incubation was achieved. The SIP incubation appeared to be successful based on the cyclic studies conducted over the course of the incubation. However, the complete analysis of the RNA samples collected could not be achieved because the labelling efficiency of the incubation could not be confirmed and the experiment was deemed unsuccessful. While the overall experiment was a failure it is believed that it would be possible to successfully apply this method in the future with the knowledge gained.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158769</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measuring cause-specific mortality in developing countries: Concepts and challenges</field><field name="creator">Rao, Chalapati</field><field name="description">Complete and efficient vital registration systems with medical certification of causes of death are the gold standard data source for mortality statistics.

The past two decades have seen an increasing need for accurate mortality statistics to facilitate planning, implementation and monitoring of health development strategies. However, there has been negligible improvement in the availability of empirical data from large tracts of the developing world. This thesis provides a methodological basis to investigate the problems with mortality data availability in detail, and suggests solutions to improve this situation. A review of the historical development of vital registration systems in western countries and the evolution in the use of these data introduces the subject. Following a discussion of the current availability of national cause of death statistics according to different categories of data quality, the thesis addresses three essential challenges. Firstly, for those populations that have very limited data, there is a need to develop an initial estimate of the levels of mortality and causes of death, as a starting point in assessing population health status and implementing basic health interventions. This challenge is addressed in the first theme of the thesis, which describes the methods to estimate cause-specific mortality in two different data availability settings, and the policy implications of such estimates. Secondly, about a third of the world&#146;s countries produce some annual data, and this creates the second challenge, which lies in evaluating the quality of these data to assess their usability. This is addressed by the second argument of the thesis, which proposes a framework to evaluate national cause of death statistics using specific criteria, and demonstrates application of these findings as well as additional research to strengthen mortality measurement and estimation. A third challenge lies in solving the basic problem, which is the inadequate functioning of vital registration and statistics systems in developing countries. The thesis proposes another framework to assess the operational characteristics of these systems across administrative, technical and societal dimensions, the results of which are useful in developing system strengthening strategies. The challenges in establishing sample registration systems and verbal autopsy methods for ascertaining cause of death are also discussed here, given their popular perception as interim measures towards developing complete vital registration systems. In conclusion, the thesis outlines additional research activities that would build upon its arguments, and defines the way forward towards improving death registration and mortality statistics systems in developing countries, taking into account the different contributory roles of international organizations, national governments, academia, and local communities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158770</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Technological Analysis of a Neolithic Lithic Workshop at Bai Ben, Vietnam</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Dong</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the issue of how stone &#145;drill points&#146; were manufactured at the Late Neolithic workshop of Bai Ben, Northeastern Vietnam, from a technological perspective, and with the aim of understanding the organisation of technology at the site. Within this organisational approach, the issue is investigated in a comprehensive manner from raw material procurement to drill manufacture, use, maintenance, and discard. Attribute based statistical methods are developed to observe the time-ordering of dimensional and morphological changes of classes of cores and drills with the ultimate aim of reconstructing the reduction sequences so that the position of drill points within these sequences is better identified. The analyses show that raw material used to produce drill points is variable in size as well as locally available and readily accessible in the region. The availability and the variation of raw material size are in turn shown to be key factors that strongly affect the whole process of core reduction at Bai Ben. It can be seen in both freehand and bipolar core populations that there is not a simple single reduction trajectory but a complex reduction process that involves reduction sequences of varying lengths. Raw material of different sizes could be transformed either by first employing freehand percussion followed by bipolar percussion, or by directly employing a bipolar technique. Cores could be discarded at many points along the reduction continuum, creating a complex pattern of core size and reduction intensity. In contrast to core reduction, drill reduction was not substantially influenced by raw material selection, but by the initial size and shape of drill blanks. This determined how much reduction was necessary to create a standardized product. The time-ordering of dimensional and morphological changes in various artefact classes thus permits us to understand the causes of assemblage variability at the site. This research represents the first application of a technological approach to the archaeological record of Vietnam. This study illustrates the benefits of conducting future technological investigations at the numerous other workshop sites known from Vietnam. It is argued that such investigations are required to build an understanding of the nature and importance of specialized lithic activities, trade, and exchange in this period of significant cultural change.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158771</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ethnography of Play in a Massively Multi-Player Online Role Playing Game: Marketplaces, Team Work and Free Play</field><field name="creator">Drennan, Penelope</field><field name="description">Massively Multi-player Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) such as Guild Wars and World of Warcraft are persistent virtual fantasy environments, which account for a large portion of the revenue generated by the games industry. Development of MMORPGs often involves significant costs in terms of funding, resources and people and an MMORPG requires a committed and stable player base in order to be successful. Due to these constraints, understanding why people choose to play MMORPGs and how players make use of the game environment can ensure that player behaviour is fully supported through effective game design. The purpose of this research was to explore whether current game design in MMORPGs supports player behaviour in social interactions and Team Work, and if not, to propose some ways to more fully support player activities in these areas. Participant observations were undertaken in order to develop a corpus of evidence of player behaviour in MMORPGs. The main study in this thesis provides detailed evidence of the social play behaviour of players in Guild Wars using a virtual ethnographic approach. The results of the ethnographic study revealed three foci of social behaviour in Guild Wars, which have been categorised as: the Marketplace, Team Work and Free Play. The Marketplace category of behaviour describes the ways that players make use of the game&#146;s communication channels to engage in trade activities such as buying and selling in-game goods and services. The Marketplace also includes profession related activities such as joining guilds and sharing knowledge. The Team Work category of behaviour describes the activities of players in relation to teams: the language of teams, leadership, role negotiation and conflict resolution. These two types of play behaviour &#150; the Marketplace and Team Work &#150; represent instrumental play in Guild Wars. The language used in these situations changes as the nature of the community changes: it is open to new players and characterised by expertise in game mechanics and the use of jargon at high levels. Finally, the Free Play category of behaviour describes the social activities of players that is free-form and not governed by rules. This type of play includes imaginary and fun play, as well as play that involves mockery and gamesmanship. The ethnography that was undertaken in Guild Wars was evaluated as to the quality of the study, using a concept analysis of player interactions which confirms the three foci as relevant to the player population in general. The final study in the research reported in this thesis was undertaken to contextualise the results within one of the more prominent descriptions of player behaviour: Bartle&#146;s (1996) taxonomy of player types. This study demonstrated that Bartle&#146;s taxonomy of player types was incomplete without Team Work, as Team Work is a significant aspect of play in most, if not all, currently available MMORPGs. The contributions of this thesis include demonstrating that many of the forms of play that exist in the real world are intrinsic forms within online games as well. In particular, players engage in forms of play that allow them to develop skills that are valuable to the game community, a type of play that is identified as &#147;play as progress&#148; by Sutton-Smith (2001). Players also engage in other forms of play, such as identityrelated play, imaginary play and play as power, which incorporates grief play identified in previous work (Bartle, 1996; Foo &amp; Koivisto, 2004). The studies that were conducted for this thesis provide evidence that players in Guild Wars have developed a complex community with its own language and social norms. Many aspects of this community are supported by game design, but there are aspects which can be improved upon, an issue which applies to other MMORPGs. The implications for design of future MMORPGs are 1) designing to avoid profession imbalance, where the community of players both relies on and is antagonistic towards one player profession and 2) the need to fully support the expectations of the player community as play and social activities develop from simple and accessible to dependant on expertise and understanding of jargon.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158772</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Testing a Group Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for Depression in Malaysia</field><field name="creator">Mamat Mukhtar, Firdaus</field><field name="description">The main aim of this thesis was to explore the assessment and treatment of depression among the Malay population of Malaysia, especially in relation to the cognitive behavioural perspective. A review of the depression literature in Malaysia (Chapter 2) suggests that the lack of depression-related instruments has prevented researchers from adequately testing the extent to which depressionrelated variables (such as automatic thoughts and dysfunctional attitude) exist among patients with depression, as well as lowering the efficacy of Group Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (GCBT) in reducing symptoms of depression and maladaptive cognitions, and also hindering investigation into the variables that predict treatment outcomes for depression. So this thesis aimed to validate one measuring instrument for assessing symptoms of depression, and two instruments for assessing cognitions; to then use these and other measures to test a range of depression variables in non-clinical and clinical samples; to present a study on the efficacy of a GCBT program for patients with mood disorders; and to finish with a study on the predictors of the outcomes of depression treatment. Chapter 3, on the Beck Depression Inventory-Malay (BDIMalay), Chapter 4, on the Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire-Malay (ATQ-Malay), and Chapter 5 on the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale- Malay (DAS-Malay) aimed at validating these three instruments to assess symptom of depression and cognitions, respectively. All three instruments were validated, using a sample size of 1090 that included both clinical and non-clinical subjects. All three scales were assessed using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses and were found to have good reliabilities and validities. Chapter 6 shows that Treatment As Usual (TAU) plus GCBT significantly reduce symptoms of depression and cognitions, and can maintain these changes for at least 6 months. The TAU plus GCBT group also showed larger effect sizes and clinically significant changes, compared with the TAU group. Chapter 7 describes the predictor variables of treatment outcome for depression, using total and subscale scores. The strengths, weaknesses, implications and recommendations for each of the studies contained in this thesis are discussed in the relevant chapters and a general discussion is presented in Chapter 8. The studies contained in this thesis were unique investigations in Malaysia in this area. They will not only add considerably to this growing area of the depression literature, but also assist in designing and conducting preventative and treatment programs, as well as contributing to future studies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158773</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DEVELOPMENT AND FUNDAMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS OF INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES FOR BIOLOGICAL NUTRIENT REMOVAL FROM ABATTOIR WASTEWATER.</field><field name="creator">Lemaire, Romain Louis Gilles</field><field name="description">The meat processing industry requires large quantities of water, much of which is discharged as wastewater containing high levels of COD and nutrients such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). These nutrients must be removed to very low levels before any discharge into local waterways to avoid causing eutrophication in receiving aquatic systems. Reliable biological COD and nitrogen removal systems have been developed and applied for abattoir wastewater treatment using continuous activated sludge systems. However, P removal is achieved primarily through chemical precipitation with the addition of large amounts of iron or alum salts. Biological P removal is often consider as being a cheaper and more sustainable option as no chemical dosing is required and the quality of the excess sludge is usually suitable for land fertilisation purposes. Compare to well established continuous wastewater treatment systems, sequencing batch reactor (SBR) technology offers a great deal of operational flexibility and appears to be a promising vehicle for achieving high levels of N and P removal from abattoir wastewater. The overall objective of this thesis is to develop a biological process that achieves high level of COD, N and P removal from abattoir wastewater, producing effluent suitable for being discharged into river systems (i.e. over 95% of the N and P contents removed). Achieving stable and reliable biological P removal from a wastewater containing high level of nitrogen is the main obstacle to overcome to achieve this objective. This study also investigate the feasibility of using two innovative technologies, namely the simultaneous nitrification, denitrification and phosphorus removal (SNDPR) process and the aerobic granular sludge technology, to further enhance the performance of the SBR system designed. In this thesis, three different lab-scale SBRs were operated to demonstrate the feasibility to achieve high-levels of biological COD, N and P removal from abattoir wastewater. The first SBR was employed to experiment novel strategies, which can easily be implemented to current water treatment facilities used by the meat industry, to produce an effluent suitable for river discharge. The second SBR was operated to provide a platform for an in-depth investigation of the previously proposed SNDPR process, which has the potential for application to the treatment of abattoir wastewater. The third SBR was operated for the treatment of abattoir wastewater by combining together the aerobic granular sludge technology and the SNDPR process. A wide range of techniques was employed in this thesis which includes reactor process studies, microbial investigations (fluorescent in-situ hybridisation combined with confocal laser scanning microscopy) and several micro-scale techniques (e.g. microsensors, electron microscopy and light microscopy). The combination of these multi-disciplinary techniques has helped deliver significant insightful information. The main contributions of this thesis are as follow. An SBR system was demonstrated to effectively remove 95%, 97% and 98% of the total COD, total N and total P present in abattoir wastewater. It could provide a real alternative to chemical P removal, which is the common practice in the meat industry. A multi-step feeding strategy was employed to prevent the accumulation of nitrate or nitrite in the SBR providing the right condition for the development of a stable biological P removal. The incorporation of a high-rate pre-fermentor as an integrated component of the nutrient removal system was found to be important. This stream, which contains a high-level of volatile fatty acids, provides supplementary carbon sources critical for both P and N removal. Further, an aeration control strategy consisting of stopping the aeration in the SBR immediately after ammonia is fully oxidised was effective in achieving stable N removal via the nitrite pathway. It benefited the nutrient removal performance of the SBR by saving some valuable amount of COD. The investigation of the SNDPR process revealed that the production of N2O, often observed in lab-scale SNDPR bioreactors and source of concern due to the high global warming potential of N2O, was found to be linked to the loss of diversity amongst the denitrifying microbial community due to the use of synthetic wastewater containing only a single carbon source. N2O accumulation is unlikely to be an issue in a SNDPR bioreactor treating real wastewater which contains a large variety of different carbon sources. The SNDPR process and the aerobic granular sludge technology were successfully combined in a single SBR process. The size and the dense structure of aerobic granules positively contributed to the oxygen mass transfer limitation required to achieve reliable SNDPR. It was also demonstrated that the minimum hydraulic retention time (HRT) for a granular sludge system is not governed by the sludge settleability, as is the case in a system with floccular sludge. Mass transfer limitations in granules are an important factor to be considered in the design of the HRT and the COD and nutrient loading rate in a granular sludge system. The in-depth study of the structure and function of these aerobic granules fed with abattoir wastewater revealed interesting structural features that have not been reported in synthetic-fed granules. These observations initiated new hypotheses regarding the microbial structure and the fate of mature granules, the effect of pH on the granule structure stability and the role played by protozoa in the overall system performance. It also provided some new directions and recommendations for further experimental studies on aerobic granules in relation to their structure and behaviour in real systems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158774</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using participatory action research in an ecologically sensitive approach to improving service delivery to people with co-occurring mental health and substance use problems.</field><field name="creator">Knightbridge, Stephen Mitchell</field><field name="description">Background The term dual diagnosis has been used to refer to the co-occurrence of mental health disorders and problematic substance use. The term has been linked with efforts to improve the interfaces between service delivery systems that have different philosophies, models of treatment and resource bases. This thesis employed the Social Ecological Model in a project that investigated community-wide issues relating to improving service delivery to people living with dual diagnosis across Southern Victoria. Method Over a period of twenty-eight months, 226 representatives from service providing agencies, carers and consumers participated in the development and implementation of this community project. The project took place over three phases. The Phase 1 study involved Participatory Action Research (PAR) that engaged stakeholders in the generation of an explanatory model concerning the state of service delivery to the target population encompassing multiple levels of social ecological analysis. A series of focus groups produced 108 statements describing what can be done to improve the system&#146;s capacity for working with complexity generally and dual diagnosis specifically. The Phase 2 study then focused on developing an ecologically relevant program to improve system responses. The resulting program involved three elements: (a) training and education, (b) consultation and mentoring, and (c) system and program development. The Phase 3 study then evaluated the effectiveness of the resulting interventions using a combination of a three (treatment groups&#151;brief training, multi-session training and multi-session plus mentoring) by three (times of testing&#151;pre-training, post training and three month follow-up) quasi-experimental design and systematic community observations. Results Qualitative themes analysis of statements generated in Phase 2 yielded four core priority areas for intervention. These were: (a) reducing system fragmentation, (b) improving integrative case management practices, (c) improving community attitudes, and (d) addressing the lack of money and resources. Evaluation of the training intervention showed that, consistent with previous research, a three-day training program enhanced workers attitudes and self-efficacy for working with dual diagnosis. This improvement was maintained at the three-month follow-up, whereas a control group that received a more standard one-day training workshop had returned to baseline levels. The inclusion of supportive follow-up and mentoring was not found to produce additional benefits. Improved attitudes and self-efficacy did not result in improvements in collaborative work practices of individual training participants. At the broader systems level, agencies that participated in the training and mentoring were found to have made considerable progress towards developing structures and processes for improving inter-sectorial linkages in the interest of delivering a more comprehensive continuum of care. The number of service initiatives targeting complex needs was found to have grown considerably through the life of the project. As the number of programs increased, the ratio of collaborative interconnections was found to have declined. This and other structural factors were identified as major targets for future evaluation cycles of the project.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158776</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations into the Structure and Function of Inhibitory Glycine and GABAA Receptors</field><field name="creator">Yang, Zhe</field><field name="description">This thesis investigated three related questions regarding the structure and function of glycine receptor (GlyR) and GABAA receptor (GABAAR) chloride channels. The first and second concerned the binding sites for the GlyR modulators, tropisetron and picrotoxin (PTX), respectively, and the third concerned the nature of structural changes in the pore of the GABAAR during gating. The main findings are summarized as follows. Study 1. The S-hydroxytryptamine type-3 receptor antagonist, tropisetron, is in clinical use as an anti-emetic drug. This compound also exerts both potentiating and inhibitory effects on the GlyR. The inhibitory effects occur at micromolar concentrations whereas the potentiating effects are shown here to occur at femtomolar concentrations at the homomeric al GlyR. Potentiation occurred only when tropisetron was applied in the presence of glycine. We also sought to identify molecular determinants oftropisetron inhibition at the al GlyR by serially mutating residues located in or near known ligand-binding sites. We discovered that conservative mutations to NI02 ablated tropisetron inhibition without affecting the magnitude or sensitivity of tropisetron potentiation. Several lines of evidence, including a structureactivity analysis of tropisetron, atropine and SB203186, suggest that NI02 may bind to the tropisetron tropane nitrogen via H-bonding. Mutation of the Nl2S residue in the Psubunit, which corresponds to N102 in the al subunit, had little effect on tropisetron inhibitory potency. These results show that N102 is required for tropisetron inhibition but not potentiation and that inhibitory tropisetron binds in different orientations at different subunit interfaces. To our knowledge, tropisetron is the most exquisitely sensitive compound yet identified for a Ligand-gated Ion Channel. Study 2. PTX is an equimolar mixture of picrotoxinin (PTXININ) and picrotin (PTN). They share common structures except that PTN possesses an extra water group. PTXININ is highly selective over PTN at the GABAAR but they are equally potent as inhibitors of the GlyR. This study sought to probe the location of their binding sites in the GlyR pore. By comparing the sensitivities of PTXININ and PTN at wild type GlyRs relative to those incorporating mutations to the G2' and T6' residues, we found that the PTXININ variable group interacts directly with the 2' residue, whereas the structurally-similar parts of PTXININ and PTN interact with T6'. This defines the orientation of PTX binding in the GlyR pore, and suggests that GABAARs exclude PTN from the pore because of its larger size. The differential sensitivity to PTN and PTXININ block provides a means of pharmacologically discriminating between a3- and ai-containing GlyRs. Study 3. Several functional approaches have shown that surface exposure of pore-lining sidechains does not change significantly during activation. Nevertheless, a disulfide trapping study conducted on al T6'Cp IT6'C GABAARs found that adjacent p subunits crosslink in the open state only. This implied that gating was mediated by psubunits contra-rotating through a summed angle of ~120&#176;. Such a large rotation is not easily reconciled with other evidence. The present study initially sought to investigate an observation that appeared to be inconsistent with the disulfide trapping results: namely that al T6'Cp I T6'C GABAARs expressed in HEK293 cells form 6' disulfide bonds in the closed state. On the basis of both electrophysiological and Western blotting experiments, we conclude that adjacent p T6'C subunits dimerise efficiently in the closed state via 6' disulfide bond formation. This finding questions the psubunit contra-rotation model of activation but raises the question of how the closed state crosslinks form. Because p T6'C subunit dimer formation is also observed in structurally symmetrical P3 GABAAR homomers, we rule out the possibility that 6' cysteines on adjacent p subunits may face towards each other in the closed state. Instead, we propose that p subunit 6' cysteines can move into sufficiently close proximity for disulfide formation via a large amplitude random thermal motion that appears to be a unique feature of psubunits. This identifies a novel feature of GABAAR gating that may have ramifications for understanding the gating mechanism of other ligand-gated ion channels. Together these studies provide new insights into the structure and function of the pore and ligand-binding domain of inhibitory glycine and GABAAreceptors.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158777</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Production and characterisation of polyclonal antiserum and monoclonal antibodies against Strongyloides ratti antigens and their utility for diagnosis of strongyloidiasis by coproantigen detection</field><field name="creator">Sykes, Alexander</field><field name="description">Human strongyloidiasis is commonly referred to as &#145;threadworm infection&#146;. Most cases of strongyloidiasis manifest as chronic mild, or asymptomatic intestinal infection that last many years. However, in certain circumstances, parasites can rapidly multiply in a patient, disseminate more widely to other organs, and cause life threatening infection. Diagnosis of strongyloidiasis can generally be undertaken by parasitological diagnosis, usually microscopy, coproculture (Harada Mori, or Baermann), or by detection of parasitespecific antibodies by ELISA. Each of these approaches have drawbacks. Similar problems have been encountered with the diagnosis of many other intestinal parasites. One way of overcoming the shortfalls of diagnostic tests of other intestine infections has been the use of coproantigen assays. Coproantigen assays are commercially available for diagnosis of a range of human and animal helminth, protozoan, bacterial and viral infections, where their sensitivity and specificity is satisfactory. For the detection of Strongyloides spp in faeces, only one coproantigen detection assay has been published for the detection of S. ratti. In this assay, whole parasitic worm antigen was used to raise polyclonal antiserum. However, the assay was relatively insensitive, and its utility to detect human Strongyloides was not investigated. In addition, compared to research undertaken in other well-studied parasites such as Hookworms, Taenia spp. and Echinococcus spp, little is known about the identity and function of E/S proteins or indeed other proteins of Strongyloides spp. In this study, a panel of antibodies was raised against S. ratti to explore the utility of Strongyloides specific antibodies for the development of a diagnostic assay and to study the biology of the parasite. The first results chapter reports the development and optimisation of a technique to isolate S. ratti excretory/secretory (E/S) antigens, and the generation of high titre antiserum in both rabbits (&#945;-E/S Ab) and mice (StrE/S MAb). &#945;-E/S Ab contained antibodies that cross-reacted with rat intestinal proteins and the dominant contaminant at ~75 kDa was determined to be rat serum albumin. Many techniques were attempted to reduce the level of cross-reactive antibodies within the antibody preparation and the successful technique utilised adsorption against a combination of uninfected rat faecal supernatant, sham E/S and uninfected rat serum. This final serum was used in a faecal supernatant immunoprecipitation experiment to purify Strongyloides coproantigen. This immunoprecipitation/coproantigen complex was utilised for the generation of monoclonal antibodies. One specific monoclonal antibody (StrE/S MAb) was generated and displayed high levels of immunoreactivity with S. ratti and S. stercoralis larval and parasitic adult worm antigens, while not cross-reacting with any rat proteins. In immunolocalisation experiments, StrE/S MAb was observed to bind to specific cells in the ovaries, including the ova. In the second results chapter the utility of a polyclonal &#945;-E/S antibody raised against S. ratti E/S to detect coproantigen is reported. High levels of cross-reactivity was observed when faecal supernatants were extracted in a common extraction buffer PBS-T or 70% Ethanol. In contrast with many published coproantigen ELISAs, the addition of foetal calf serum or rat serum in the assay did not improve the signal:noise ratio. However, when faecal supernatants were extracted in formalin levels cross-reactivity with faecal components was eliminated, while preserving the positive signal in infected samples. Coproantigen stability was explored with a panel of faecal samples preserved at 4&#176;C, extracted and unextracted in formalin. Interestingly, formalin-extracted faecal supernatants stored at 4&#176;C tested negative, whereas faecal samples preserved, unextracted in formalin remained coproELISA positive. Finally, three consecutive stool samples were collected from a patient infected with S. stercoralis and extracted in formalin. The stool samples collected tested negative for larvae by sodium nitrate flotation and Baermann concentration, suggesting a sub-patent infection. All three faecal supernatants tested coproELISA positive at the standard assay dilution namely 1/4 and remained positive when diluted further to 1/8. The final results chapter describes the characterisation of a monoclonal antibody raised against S. ratti parasitic adult worm extract (MAb 8C3) by molecular, histochemical and proteomic techniques. Specificity for the parasitic adult worm lifecycle stage alone was demonstrated by immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation and immunohistochemistry. Using immunohistochemistry the target organ of MAb 8C3 was identified as nerve cords in the parasitic adult worm hypodermis. Proteomic analysis identified MAb 8C3&#146;s target antigen as the 10 kDa chaperone protein, CPN10. The validity of standard proteomic analysis for the characterization of nematode proteins and the characterization of S. ratti CPN10 is discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158778</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The physiology of phosphorus uptake and the role of specialised dauciform roots in Caustis blakei</field><field name="creator">Playsted, Cameron</field><field name="description">The impoverished nature of the phosphorus-poor soils which dominate the Australian continent has given rise to an abundant array of adaptations in Australian flora which help to overcome the phosphorus (P) limiting conditions. Attempts to domesticate Australian native plants into conventional nursery production systems have been hampered by the sensitivity of a number of species to the essential mineral element P. Enhanced P uptake and high internal P use efficiency of Australian plants is often ironically linked with sensitivity to even slight increases in P availability, producing symptoms of P toxicity. The non-mycorrhizal Australian native sedge Caustis blakei K&#252;k. (Cyperaceae) occurs on nutrient-poor deep sands and soils derived from weathered sandstones on the east coast of Australia. As a species with commercial potential in the cut flower industry, an understanding of the P nutrition of C. blakei is essential to its viable cultivation. The objective of this study was to characterise the high P-use efficiency of C. blakei, and to examine its extreme sensitivity to P fertilisation. We hypothesised that the feedback mechanism which triggers the downregulation of P uptake in C. blakei is ineffective and leads to increased sensitivity to P toxicity under application of highly soluble P. The influence of external P supply on two low-P adapted Australian native plants, C. blakei and Chamelaucium uncinatum Schauer. (waxflower), and on the fast-growing crop species Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. (tomato) was determined. Increased P-absorption rates in waxflower and tomato were associated with increasing relative growth rates (RGR); however, the RGR for C. blakei peaked at the lowest P-absorption rate, and due to P toxicity at higher P supply, increasing absorption rates lowered its RGR. These results suggest that, unlike tomato and waxflower, C. blakei may not be able to down-regulate its P uptake, and hence solution P concentrations greater than 10 &#956;M become toxic; C. blakei grown at 250 &#956;M P accumulated P to toxic concentrations as high as 12 mg g-1 DM in the shoots. In contrast, at lower solution P concentrations, C. blakei appeared to be highly efficient in its acquisition and internal use of P, where the highest biomass was produced at the low solution [P] of 1.0 &#956;M. Furthermore, low-P adaptations included an increased root mass ratio and the formation of &#145;dauciform&#146; roots when plants were grown at low solution [P] of 1.0 &#956;M and below. The intriguing discovery of swollen lateral, hairy, dauciform roots has enabled the elucidation of physiological processes central to the P economy of C. blakei. We tested the hypothesis that these hairy, swollen lateral roots play a similar role to cluster roots in the exudation of organic chelators and ectoenzymes known to aid the chemical mobilisation of sparingly available soil nutrients, such as P. Dauciform-root development and exudate composition (carboxylates and acid phosphatase activity) were analysed in C. blakei plants grown in nutrient solution under P-starved conditions. The distribution of dauciform roots in the field was determined in relation to soil profile depth and matrix. The percentage of dauciform roots of the entire root mass was greatest at the lowest [P] in solution, and was suppressed with increasing solution [P], while in the field, dauciform roots were predominately located in the upper soil horizons, and decreased with increasing soil depth. Citrate was the major carboxylate released in an exudative burst from mature dauciform roots, which also produced elevated levels of acid phosphatase activity. Malonate was the dominant internal carboxylate present, with the highest concentration in young dauciform roots. The root expression of two putative high affinity P transporters CbPT1 and CbPT2 was assessed in relation to the net-P uptake rate from C. blakei plants after pre-treatment at a range of solution P concentrations (0.01-10&#956;M). Net-P uptake rates were unchanged across the whole range of pre-treatment concentrations, even in plants grown at 10 &#956;M P which showed symptoms of P toxicity. Both CbPT1 and CbPT2 were induced by low P concentrations (0.01-0.1&#956;M) and while CbPT2 was suppressed under increased P concentrations, CbPT1 was less responsive and appeared to down-regulate only at extremely high solution [P] between 100 and 250&#956;M. Expression analysis during dauciform-root development revealed that CbPT2 expression gradually increased in alignment with dauciform root age, reaching its highest expression in mature dauciform roots. The P uptake system of C. blakei is able to respond at a morphological and molecular level to P limiting conditions through the induction of dauciform roots with enhanced expression of P transporters. The high concentration of carboxylates and phosphatases released from dauciform roots, combined with their prolific distribution in the organic surface layer of nutrient-impoverished soils, provides an ecophysiological advantage for enhancing nutrient acquisition. The refined low-P sensing of C. blakei is contrasted by an inability to down-regulate the P uptake system under luxury P supply, which may be a consequence of natural selection in ecosystems devoid of P in excess of plant demand. The adaptations to low-P environments of Australian plants such as C. blakei produced through many generations of natural selection may indicate potential areas to be harnessed in the breeding and selection of crops growing in the many P depleted soils of the world. In particular, further unravelling of the intricate nature of dauciform root physiology may provide useful insights into the low-P tolerance of plants.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158779</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Other Country: A Father&#146;s Journey with Autism.</field><field name="creator">Whelan, Michael</field><field name="description">The memoir &#147;The Other Country&#148; and the essay &#147;Inspiration is Power&#148; examine i) contemporary experiences of autism and ii) the representation of autism disorder in scientific and autobiographical writing. &#147;The Other Country&#148; is a memoir of four years in the life of its author Michael Whelan, and his family, in the care of his son, Charlie. In February 1998, Charlie was diagnosed with autism, and in that moment Michael and his family&#146;s lives changed. The memoir describes in four parts a four-year journey through a father&#146;s experiences: Part 1, &#145;Welcome to Holland&#146;, the family&#146;s feelings of fear, grief and dislocation following diagnosis; Part 2, &#145;Look at Me&#146;, the chaotic process of research and treatment, and intense early intervention programs; Part 3, &#145;The Enchanted Cottage&#146;, the slow process of recovery that the family went through; and Part 4, &#145;The Long Way Home&#146;, the transformation of Charlie, Michael and his family and notions of home and normalcy. The title, &#147;The Other Country&#148;, in this context refers to the largely invisible parallel society inhabited by anyone who lives outside the mainstream. The accompanying critical essay, &#147;Inspiration is Power&#148;, examines the influence of the discourses of biomedical science and parental pathology on the representation and understanding of autism. Specifically, among autism narratives, the medical voice has an overwhelming authority and power in characterizing autistic disorder and experience for the lay reader. This discourse contests the moral authority of parental autobiographical writing, which, by contrast, characterizes autism as a personalized invading &#147;other&#148; and thief of their child. Through a critique of specific aspects of identity, narrative, evidence and authority, the essay suggests a register of rhetorical moves that may be employed to influence, and consequently empower, the reader of autism narratives.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158780</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of White Patch Syndrome, a putative disease affecting corals in the genus Porites on the Great Barrier Reef</field><field name="creator">Davy, Joanne</field><field name="description">Coral reefs around the globe are increasingly threatened by a number of natural and anthropogenic factors, and coral cover on many reefs has already been greatly reduced due to mortality associated with bleaching events and coral disease outbreaks. Understanding the potential effects of disease is, in most instances, hampered by a lack of knowledge. The pathogens causing the majority of coral diseases have yet to be identified and little is known about the effects of environmental factors on disease initiation and progression. In general, reefs in the Caribbean and Western Atlantic have suffered the greatest losses due to coral disease and the majority of research has focused on these regions. However, reports of disease outbreaks in the Indo-Pacific have increased in recent years and the need to understand the potential risks to reefs in this region is no less important. The aim of this research was to characterise a newly discovered disease-like state affecting corals in the genus Porites at Heron and Wistari reefs, at the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Results of the study revealed that this disease is dissimilar to other coral diseases in several respects. Named White Patch Syndrome (WPS), it manifests as discrete bleached foci on colonies of the common massive corals Porites australiensis, P. lobata and P. lutea. The results of a long-term monitoring programme of tagged corals indicated a discrete and dynamic (yet persistent) pattern of lesion formation that could suggest a chronic, recurring infection, but which importantly was not observed to result in colony mortality. The erratic pattern of lesion progression and regression was not linked to seawater temperature fluctuations, and colonies in close proximity to each other showed markedly different patterns of disease occurrence. Analysis of physiological variables, such as host protein content (i.e. tissue biomass), Symbiodinium density and Symbiodinium photosynthetic capacity was performed to clarify how the host and symbionts differed in the lesion tissue as compared to the healthy tissue surrounding it. Symbiont density was found to be reduced by approximately two thirds in lesion tissue when compared to the visibly healthy tissue, but symbiont cells remaining within WPS lesions photosynthesised efficiently and no host tissue loss was evident. Furthermore, there was no difference in the sub-clade of Symbiodinium sp. contained within lesion or visibly healthy tissue. Microscopic examination of diseased, visibly healthy and healthy control tissues, using a range of microscopic techniques, was carried out to further clarify if and how both partners in the symbiosis were affected by WPS. A bacterial role in the disease was not evident using histopathology or fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). However, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed the presence of virus-like particles (VLPs) in both visibly healthy and diseased tissue. TEM also revealed that both apoptosis and necrosis were occurring at a low level in both the host and symbiont. TEM analysis of VLPs associated with the coral surface microlayer (CSM) of visibly healthy and diseased tissues showed that while a single viral morphotype was present within the coral tissue more than 14 morphotypes were identifiable in the CSM. No discernible difference between the viral communities of the CSM of diseased and visibly healthy tissues was apparent, however. A methodology combining density gradient centrifugation and TEM was established to isolate the DNA from VLPs in the tissues of Porites corals. Preliminary phylogenetic analysis of the protein sequence of a fragment of the ribonucleoside reductase (small sub-unit) gene (rr2) indicated that the virus may be unique, but further characterisation is needed to confirm this. Important aspects of a previously undocumented disease affecting a major genus of reefbuilding coral on the GBR were determined through the course of this study. Most notably, the disease does not exhibit temporal changes that are related to seawater temperature, which is in contrast to the majority of other coral diseases, nor does it result in coral colony mortality. The discovery of a putative virus within tissues of Porites colonies affected by WPS could be indicative of a chronic viral infection, and this may or may not be related to the appearance of the bleached foci. The discovery of a coral tissue-associated VLP represents the first such discovery for wild corals. Further research is now required to complete the molecular characterisation of the Porites virus and to establish what role, if any, it plays in WPS.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158781</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE CATTLE GRAZING WITHIN A CULTURE OF PRODUCTIVISM? A SOCIOLOGICAL STUDY OF BROADSCALE BEEF PRODUCTION IN CENTRAL QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA</field><field name="creator">Richards, Carol Ann</field><field name="description">Accompanying the rise of environmentalism in the public consciousness since the 1970s, is a growing concern about the impact of primary production on Australia&#146;s natural resource base. Within scientific discourses, it has been argued that the introduction of European-style agricultural and pastoral practices to Australia has proven to be unsuited to a dry and arid land, and that this has resulted in large-scale environmental degradation. Activities that are associated with the production of beef, such as broadscale tree clearing and the overgrazing of pastures, have been linked to problems such as climate change, increased soil salinity, soil erosion and the degradation of waterways. Despite claims that scientific knowledge contains the solutions to environmental problems, it has long been recognised that farmers and graziers do not readily &#145;adopt&#146; recommended practices. In response to these concerns, this thesis focuses upon the social dimensions of the environmental problems related to beef production in Australia and asks; &#145;What social, cultural, political and economic factors prevent or facilitate sustainable land management practices within the cattle grazing industry of the Fitzroy Basin, Central Queensland?&#146; Within social science disciplines, the issue of &#145;adoption&#146; has largely been examined through the epistemological traditions of structure (political economy) and agency (values, attitudes and beliefs). In political economy terms, it is argued that primary production is not profitable due to the external constraints of the global market economy. As a result, graziers are required to make up this financial shortfall through the production of more beef from the same resource base which has, in turn, resulted in the unsustainable exploitation of natural resources. Actor-level conceptualisations of &#145;adoption&#146; focus upon individuals and groups and their propensity to adopt or reject recommended practices. These agency and structure perspectives are found to be largely unsatisfactory, due to their artificially polarised accounts of the social world. Instead, it is argued that the problem of environmental sustainability can be better explained using a theory of culture, which recognises how agency and structure are bound together in social practices. This is achieved through the application of Bourdieu&#146;s theory of practice and, more specifically, his concepts of habitus and field. The components of sustainability are explored through in-depth interviews with 40 graziers who own and operate pastoral beef properties in the Fitzroy Basin area of Central Queensland &#150; an area whose regional centre, Rockhampton, is colloquially referred to as the &#145;beef capital of Australia&#146;. By examining discourse as a social practice, it is shown that different groups variously construct the concept of sustainability and that these constructions lead to conflict in the &#145;rival principles of legitimacy&#146; between fields of cultural production &#150; in this case, relating to sustainable beef grazing practices. It is demonstrated that a shared habitus among graziers within Central Queensland is the product of the cumulative assimilation of an established ethos of productivism. As such, alternative practices available to graziers are rendered unthinkable, often precluding the implementation of sustainable practices as identified by those &#145;outside&#146; rural industries. Graziers regularly draw upon discursive resources to both defend the current format of primary production and refute environmental &#145;truth-claims&#146;. This is achieved by challenging the validity of scientific knowledge, denying the existence of an environmental problem, and questioning the agendas of the government, &#145;greenies&#146; and urban people, who are perceived to be the key proponents of environmental &#145;misinformation&#146;. A small group of landholders who have broken away from traditional practices and ventured into a form of beef production known as cell grazing &#150; which is said to be both ecologically and economically sustainable &#150; have been subject to criticism by &#145;conventional&#146; graziers for flouting the received wisdom of traditional grazing methods. By &#145;enculturating&#146; actor and political economy accounts of &#145;adoption&#146;, this research offers a unique contribution to an emerging body of knowledge that is concerned with the way in which culture intersects with land management practices. More specifically, it is found that: land management practices are characterised by a culturally embedded ethic of productivism that is incompatible with broader politics of environmentalism; sustainability is a problematic concept that is variably constructed according to the habitus of producers and others; discursive techniques, which reflect habitus, are deployed by graziers to both deny the existence of an environmental problem and deflect criticism by &#145;condemning the condemners&#146;; and, finally, cell graziers possess a more flexible habitus that renders them as &#145;outsiders&#146; but also enables them to experiment with new grazing practices and off-farm entrepreneurialism, and withstand the criticism from the conventional grazing community. Given these discoveries, it is argued that current practices &#150; deeply embedded as they are in a culture of productivism &#150; are resistant to change. Whilst cultural change is possible, it is unlikely to occur at the rate necessary to produce desirable sustainability outcomes in the short to medium term. This does not bode well for a wholesale shift towards more ecologically sustainable beef production in Central Queensland or, more widely, in Australia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158782</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE ECONOMICS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY POLICY WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO AUSTRALIA</field><field name="creator">Ivanova, Galina</field><field name="description">This thesis examines some aspects of the economics of the Australian Federal Government&#146;s Mandatory Renewable Energy Target (MRET) policy with a special reference to Queensland. The objective of this policy is to increase the market share of renewable energy technologies in the Electricity Supply Industry (ESI) in Australia. The Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) market was established to achieve the desired market share of renewable energy technologies. These certificates are issued to renewable energy generators for each megawatt hour of eligible renewable electricity produced by generators. In Australia, electricity retailers and other large consumers of electricity have to buy a certain amount of RECs and then surrender RECs to the renewable energy regulator in order to comply with the policy. If retailers and other large consumers of electricity do not have the required amount of RECs by a certain day they have to pay a specified penalty. Renewable energy technologies are less emission intensive than conventional fossil-fuel electricity generation technologies. Therefore, the increased market share of renewable energy technologies is expected to result in reduced emissions from the electricity industry and corresponding improvements in environmental quality. The problem, however, is that private costs of producing electricity from renewable energy technologies are in general more expensive than private costs of producing electricity from conventional fossil-fuel generation technologies. Further, the recent structural reforms of the Australian electricity sector and removal of legal barriers to entry in generation have contributed to the private cost advantage which fossil - fuel electricity generation has in general over renewable technologies. This thesis investigates the options available to policymakers to internalise externalities in the ESI, the cost of emissions from the ESI, and benefits of increasing the market share of renewable energy technologies. It also looks at the renewable energy policies adopted in various countries. The thesis presents simulation models examining the impact of the MRET policy as if it were a state based scheme adopted by the state of Queensland. Models also illustrate how a carbon tax can change the merit order of the Queensland ESI. It highlights the advantages and disadvantages of the MRET policy. This thesis looks at the supply side by examining main components and effects of the Australian MRET policy including, using the methodology of experimental economics, the effects of the penalty for non-compliance in the context of a specific market structure. Increasing the market share of the renewable energy technologies is also approached from the demand side. This thesis examines consumers&#146; willingness to pay (WTP) to protect the environment. Important influences on WTP higher prices in order to protect the environment were analysed on the international and Australian levels using the 1993 and 2000 International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) data and the Australian data from the 2003 Australian Survey of Social Attitudes (AuSSA). This thesis also employs a contingent valuation survey that was developed to determine the extent to which consumers are willing to pay to protect the environment, to support the MRET policy and to pay for electricity generated from renewable energy. The contingent valuation survey was administered in Queensland. The simulation results indicated that there were enough available low cost renewable energy resources (such as biomass) in Queensland if the state were to adopt the Federal Government&#146;s MRET scheme policy objectives and policy instruments (such as RECs market and a penalty for non-compliance) as a state scheme. However, it is unlikely that all these resources will be employed due to several factors (e.g., the seasonal nature of some of the biomass resources, such as waste from sugar mills). Therefore the price of RECs could be quite high and just below the penalty. It was also concluded that the presence of a penalty for non-compliance in the RECs market can lead to a high RECs price. Wrong market price signals could lead to inefficient investments in renewable energy technologies. Several important results emerged from the analysis of WTP for the protection of the environment: 1) in most countries considered, marginal willingness to pay to protect the environment was less in 2000, than in 1993; 2) respondents were more inclined to state that they were willing to pay higher prices in order to protect the environment than they were to pay higher taxes; 3) respondents were more reluctant to pay for an environmental good if the good is provided on a very large scale, such as the global environment, compared with an environmental good provided on a small scale which impacts mainly the local environment; 4) WTP to protect the environment is associated strongly with perceptions of the risk of environmental destruction; and 5) although there are many similarities among the characteristics of the consumers in different countries who are willing to pay more for environmental protection, the country specific research is required to account for local specifics. The analysis of the data obtained by the Queensland survey showed that the demand side can support some investments in low cost renewable energy technologies. Consumers indicated a strong preference for voluntary support of support renewable energy technologies compared with the mandatory support as required by the MRET policy.

Creative thinking is characterised by the ability to find solutions, from outside of the existing norms, that are both novel and useful. This ability is increasingly seen as an important component of engineering problem solving and a necessary component of innovation. The investigation was broadly divided into three stages. The first stage consisted of an exploratory case study in a small design team and involved participant-observation of design tasks. Another important aspect of this engagement was the development of a software tool for use by the design team, called the Tool for Embedding Systems engineering in Small teams (TESS). This engagement allowed an alternative perspective on the problem, that of the tool developer rather than the tool user. In the second stage, a theoretical analysis of creativity was undertaken where the aim was to develop a synthesised and idealised Model of Creativity. This allowed access to a theoretical viewpoint on the problem, and provided an opportunity to place the findings into the context of the wider literature. The third and final stage consisted of the collection of data through an online survey, the aim of which was to test the findings of the case study in a wider forum. Evidence was found the suggests that there are ways in which modern engineering design software, particularly CAD, can both assist and impede the creative problem solving process in engineering design. The evidence was based on observations that were made which were supported by the theoretical model and the survey. Firstly, CAD has a significant potential to enhance the visualisation of potential design solutions, assisting individual designers in their creative output, as well as the creative output of design teams. This advantage is tempered by the inappropriateness of CAD for handling the fast generation of ambiguous ideas which characterises the early stages of creative problem solving. Secondly, the use of CAD has the potential to create a kind of artificial design fixation, known as premature fixation, which can be a significant barrier to the creative process. This is particularly the case for modern CAD tools which encourage the user to generate highly parameterised, interconnected models, which tend to be flexible to small changes but inflexible to large structural changes after they have been implemented. The third finding is known as circumscribed thinking, and it describes the phenomenon whereby the design process is significantly driven by the capabilities and characteristics of the CAD package and its user, rather than by the requirements of the task. Finally, it was found that the mode of working that is usually experienced by CAD designers, which can often be solitary and frustrating work, can affect the motivation of the designer to the extent that it affects their ability and willingness to be creative in their design process, creating what is known as bounded ideation. These findings are significant in several ways. There has been little previous acknowledgement of the importance of these issues. Engineering software tools in general, and CAD in particular, are generally assumed to always have a positive influence on both the quality of work of engineering designers and their productivity; the only &#147;costs&#148; are assumed to be financial ones. It is hoped that this work will raise awareness among engineering designers and software tool developers of the importance and nature of creative problem solving in engineering design and show that without sufficient caution the tools that designers increasingly rely on may unintentionally act as barriers to that process. By designing and using our tools in the right way we can avoid these problems. This is an exploratory study and it is hoped that future studies will extend and solidify the findings of this thesis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158784</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Data Partitioning Approach To Frequent Pattern Mining</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Son Nhu</field><field name="description">Data mining uses algorithms to extract knowledge from a large and complex data set. Due to the large volume of data, efficiency has become an important issue in data analysis. Two basic aspects of computing including algorithmic (time and space complexity) and performance (effectiveness and efficiency) will be considered for new data mining methods. During the last decade, many techniques have been developed to deal with data mining problems. However, because the computational resources are limited, most of the state-of-the-art techniques face the difficulties and drawbacks when mining with very large and complex input data sets. In our research, we focus our considerations on a data partitioning approach to tackle the scalable challenges of frequent pattern mining. The basic idea of the data partitioning approach is quite simple. The data set is initially partitioned into fragments and the whole process is divided into two main phases. At the first phase, the data mining methods are applied to process individual fragments (in isolation from the other data fragments) to get a local result. At the second phase, a combinated step generates the global result. The main technical challenge is to achieve the same computational results (as would be executed on the entire data set) but to gain some efficiency features from the adopted data partitioning approach. Hence, the main research question is how to partition the data set so that data partitioning will be beneficial. Firstly, we present our research of a data partitioning approach to frequent itemset mining, one of the most commonly performed data mining tasks. In particular, we will consider frequent itemset mining and sequential pattern mining where substantial effectiveness benefits have been gained. We will also discuss some further potential efficiency improvements that can be gained by our pre-processing data techniques, such as incremental clustering algorithm. The next step is to extend our research into the formulation of research problems, including more advanced optimisation of the currently successfully applied procedures and deployment of the data partitioning concepts into the sequential pattern mining. It seems very natural to keep data in some well-defined sectors that should assist in the identification of efficient maintenance methods. Because a database is often dynamic in reality, maintaining sequential patterns (over a significantly long period) becomes essential for sequential pattern mining. We study incremental sequential pattern mining. We propose a new improvement to overcome the drawbacks of current incremental mining techniques. In the final part of our work, we extend our scope of research to structure mining such as tree mining and graph mining, particularly presenting the data partitioning approach to graph mining. We also discuss the completeness and correctness of the other well-known approaches to graph mining.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158785</field></doc><doc><field name="title">REDOX PROPERTIES AND MEMBRANE LOCALIZATION OF HUMAN RECOMBINANT CYTOCHROME P450 SYSTEMS</field><field name="creator">Shukla, Alka</field><field name="description">Human cytochrome P450s are responsible for the metabolism of approximately 90% of drugs and carcinogens. Their activity dictates the effective concentrations of drugs in the body, the length of time for which they act and the beneficial or the toxic effects mediated by metabolites. Drug metabolizing P450s are present in the liver along with NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) which acts as a redox partner. P450s have been successfully expressed in various recombinant systems. It is difficult to isolate individual P450s in large amounts from microsomes, limiting the use of the native enzymes in drug development and discovery. The heterologous expression of human P450s, particularly in Escherichia coli (E. coli), provides an abundant and economical source of P450s that can be used for studying the structure and function of these enzymes and exploring their biotechnological potential. P450s have been successfully expressed in E. coli by incorporating certain modifications in the N-terminal region. In the present work, I have addressed fundamental questions related to the basic biology of these enzymes: their redox properties and degree of membrane integration. The redox properties of P450s 2C9, 2C18 and 2C19, and human and rat CPR were determined by immobilizing the enzyme on an electrode surface in the presence of didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB) surfactant film. A single pair of reversible redox couples was observed in case of P450s whereas, two pairs of well separated redox couples were observed in case of human and rat CPR. The protein was strongly adsorbed on the electrode surface in all cases as evidenced by the linear dependence of current on scan rate. The redox potential was pH dependent for both P450s and CPR with a variation of -59 mv/pH unit in the range of 6pH 9. The redox potential of P450s remained unaffected by saturating concentration of its substrate, phenytoin. Amongst P450 2C members, P450 2C19 showed highest redox potential followed by P450 2C18 and then P450 2C9. In this work, we have also demonstrated the high potential FMNox/FMNsq response of CPR, which was not shown for CPR isolated from any other source by direct electrochemical studies. Several N-terminal modifications have been incorporated for successful expression of P450s in E. coli such as changing the second codon to encode an alanine residue, enhancing AT content, truncation, replacing N-terminal sequence with other well expressed forms such as P450 17A, 2C3, 2E1. Membrane integration properties were assessed by immunoblotting and fluorescence microscopy techniques. P450s with N-terminal sequence hydrophobicity comparable with the native sequence (recombinant forms 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9 (MALLLAVFL), 2C18, 2C19 (MALLLAVFLL), 2D6 (DB4) and 3A4 (3-12) and 3A5 (3-12) were shown to be integral membrane proteins whereas those in which the N-terminal sequence had reduced hydrophobicity (recombinant P450s 2A13, 2C9 (3-20), 2C19 (3-20), 2D6 (DB11) and 2E1) were loosely attached to the membrane. So, the hydrophobicity and the length of N-terminal sequence play a crucial role in membrane integration. Attempts were also made to study the interaction between P450 and CPR in bacterial membrane using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Fusion expression constructs were made for P450 3A4 and CPR with yellow and cyan fluorescent proteins. However, apparent toxicity to cells and poor spectroscopic properties of the CFP fusion proteins obviated an investigation of the interaction between P450 and CPR by FRET. In conclusion, the studies done in this thesis will help us to understand the mechanism of electron transfer between P450s and CPR and also in fabricating new kinds of biosensor and biomedical devices. This study has also shown the importance of expressing P450s in E.coli with N-terminal sequences as close as possible to native sequence and confirming the degree of membrane integration of recombinant forms with modified N-terminal amino acid sequences.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158786</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genomic profiling of tumour recurrence in non-small-cell lung carcinoma</field><field name="creator">Larsen, Jill</field><field name="description">Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death in Western countries with an overall 5- year survival of 10-15%, due largely to late stage detection where indiscernible residual disease is commonly present. Complete surgical resection remains the most effective treatment; however, disease recurrence remains the major reason for treatment failure. Nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) comprises approximately 80% of all lung cancers. Generally, early stage tumours have better clinical outcome, with stage I NSCLC having a 5- year survival of approximately 65% after surgery. However, disease recurrence has been reported to occur in up to 30-40% of stage I NSCLCs, indicating that despite aiding treatment planning, there are limitations in current clinical staging techniques. This study addressed the hypothesis that genomic alterations present in the primary tumour of NSCLCs may promote rapid disease recurrence and therefore, the genomic profile of the primary tumour may predict the likelihood of tumour recurrence. The primary aim of this study was to characterise genomic differences between lung cancers that demonstrate considerable differences in clinical outcome despite similar tumour stage and treatment. Specifically, tumours were defined as either &#8216;recurrent&#8217; (disease recurrence within 3-18 months of surgical resection) or &#8216;non-recurrent&#8217; (no evidence of disease recurrence for at least 36 months following surgical resection). Two whole-genome microarray platforms were used to identify gene expression and DNA copy-number changes associated with recurrence in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma (AC), the two main histological subtypes of NSCLC. Gene expression data was analysed to determine if gene expression signatures were present in the primary tumour that can predict the likelihood of tumour recurrence. DNA copy-number data derived from array-comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH) microarrays were compared to identify discriminating aberrations between the two recurrence phenotypes. The secondary aim of this study was to explore genomic aberrations and expression patterns in NSCLC, irrespective of recurrence phenotype, to extend upon current knowledge of molecular aberrations in this tumour type. 139 tumour samples from resected primary NSCLCs were used in this study. Of these, 99 samples (51 SCC, 48 AC) fit to either the &#8216;recurrent&#8217; or &#8216;non-recurrent&#8217; phenotype: 57 &#8216;nonrecurrent&#8217; NSCLCs (32 SCC, 25 AC) and 42 &#8216;recurrent&#8217; NSCLCs (19 SCC, 23 AC). Gene expression profiling was performed by hybridising total RNA extracted from each tumour to 22K Human Operon microarrays, containing 14,159 known genes. Cox proportional hazards modelling was used to develop a signature to predict recurrence, identifying genes whose expression correlated with time to recurrence. The predictive capability of the AC and SCC signatures were assessed by predicting outcome in independent tumour samples (test sets) using publicly available microarray data. Copy-number variation (CNV) (DNA gain/loss) was identified using a Human Genome CGH Microarray 44B (Agilent Technologies Inc.), containing ~43,000 probes, hybridising genomic DNA against normal female DNA. Significant regions of CNV were identified using an aberration detection algorithm (Agilent Technologies Inc.). AC and SCC subtypes were analysed separately to prevent the identification of histotype rather than recurrence-associated changes. Two gene expression signatures were identified &#8211; a 54-gene signature in ACs and a 111-gene signature in SCCs &#8211; that accurately predicted outcome in independent test sets, independently of conventional indicators such as stage. The 54-gene AC signature was validated in two independent AC cohorts. Patients predicted to recur had significantly shorter survival in 55 stage I-III ACs (log-rank p=0.039; hazard ratio (HR), 2.2; 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI), 1.1-4.7) and 40 stage I-III ACs (p=0.044; HR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.4-7.9). The 111-gene SCC signature was tested in another independent cohort of 58 stage I-III SCCs, and patients predicted to recur also had significantly shorter survival (p=0.001; HR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.6-8.7). Furthermore, the signatures had predictive ability in stage I ACs and SCCs, identifying a subset of samples with significantly poorer outcome (AC stage I: p=0.021; HR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.1-10.7; and p=0.042; HR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.0-8.0; and SCC stage I: p=0.031; HR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.1-8.5), demonstrating superiority to current clinicopathologic indicators. Five previously published gene expression signatures reported to predict outcome in NSCLC were also tested in the study cohort of 99 NSCLCs. Four of the five signatures demonstrated some measure of prognostic prediction capability. aCGH analysis identified CNVs that discriminate between recurrence phenotypes. In ACs, 15 CNVs discriminated between &#8216;recurrent&#8217; and &#8216;non-recurrent&#8217; tumours. They include gain of 9q34.3 and 10p15.3 and loss of 21q11.2-q21.1, which were more common recurrent ACs, and gain of 4p13-4p12 and loss of 14q23.3-q32.33 which were more common in non-recurrent ACs (p&lt;0.05, P2). In SCCs, 17 CNVs discriminated between recurrence phenotypes, including gain of 2q22.1-q24.2 and 8q24.3 in recurrent SCCs and loss of 3p26.3-p24.3 and 8p23.1-8p12 in non-recurrent SCCs (p&lt;0.05, P2). Thirty-one genes with aCGH and expression probes binding to the same genomic location were selected to examine DNA copy-number driven expression. A subset of genes demonstrated correlation between copy-number and mRNA transcript level in tumour samples. In relation to the secondary aim, gene expression profiling determined that primary SCCs staged N1 by direct extension were biologically more similar to SCCs staged N0 compared with SCCs staged N1 by lymphatic metastasis. The aCGH analysis of 139 NSCLCs, irrespective of recurrence phenotype, identified frequent CNV such as 1q, 3q and 5p gain and 3p, 6q, 8p and 9p loss. Additionally, 62 high level amplifications and 19 putative hemizygous/homozygous deletions were identified containing both known and novel NSCLC genes. Comparison of AC and SCC subtypes also identified discriminating CNVs. In conclusion, this study used a whole-genome approach to characterise primary NSCLCs as a whole, and in relation to histotype and tumour recurrence. Expression profiling identified signatures that could predict recurrence in independent (test set) tumour samples. Highresolution aCGH analysis identified CNVs that were significantly associated with disease recurrence. Genes located in these regions, especially those identified by the integration of gene expression and copy-number data, has refined target loci/genes, and represent novel targets for future research including therapeutic design.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158787</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimising the assessment of renal function and determining the renal elimination of drugs using various methodologies</field><field name="creator">Roos, Juliana</field><field name="description">The global aim of this PhD thesis is to explore a number of methodologies to optimise the assessment of renal function and investigate the renal elimination of drugs. It is unclear in the literature whether cystatin C (CysC) is a better predictor of renal impairment than serum creatinine (SCr). A systematic review was undertaken to compare the diagnostic accuracy of CysC versus SCr which identified 27 population-groups in 24 studies (total number of people, n=2007) that compared the diagnostic accuracy of CysC with SCr. Metatest&#239;&#191;&#189; and RevMan&#239;&#191;&#189; were the softwares applied in this meta-analysis study. The diagnostic odds ratios (DORs) (95%CI) of predicting renal dysfunction derived from a Moses-Littenberg linear regression model were 3.99 (3.41-4.57) for CysC and 2.79 (2.12-3.46) for SCr. The diagnostic accuracy for impaired renal function favours CysC, however, CysC does not offer a statistically significant advantage over SCr, the confidence intervals of the DORs overlap. Further studies should be undertaken to find an endogenous marker of GFR that has a higher accuracy of predicting renal dysfunction than CysC and SCr. It has been suggested that Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients have different pharmacokinetics (PK) compared to healthy volunteers, which could be the result of supra-physiological renal function for renally eliminated drugs. Two population pharmacokinetic (popPK) models were developed for cefepime and cefpirome administered as 2 g every 12 h as a 3 min. intravenous infusion. Both popPK models for cefepime and cefpirome were 3-compartment with zeroorder input which best described the concentration-time data and accounted for between subject and between occasion variability in this population. The popPK models were used to simulate, via Monte Carlo simulations (n=1000), free-drug concentrations of cefepime and cefpirome for two administration methods: (1) intermittent bolus administration (IBA); (2) continuous infusion (CI). Concentration-time profiles were evaluated by the probability of achieving free-drug concentrations above the MIC for greater than 65% of the dosing interval, defined as the probability of target attainment (PTA). Finally, the PTA expectation values for each antimicrobial and each dosing administration were evaluated using MIC distributions of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii. When cefepime and cefpirome are administered via IBA or CI for E. coli and K. pneumoniae, both should be successful in current dosing scheduled in achieving the bactericidal target. However, against P. aeruginosa, a daily dose of 4 g/day of cefepime administered as CI is required to achieve a PTA expectation value of &gt;90%, while for cefpirome, doses greater than 6 g/day administered as CI may need to be considered to optimise therapy in ICU patients. For the treatment of A. baumannii, doses of cefepime and cefpirome greater than 6 g/day administered as CI are required to maximize therapeutic outcome in ICU patients. Pharmaceutical companies are often not able to optimally use data obtained from phase I PK studies to design their future phase II studies. Using fluconazole as an example drug, two existing studies were identified and used to illustrate techniques for achieving this, i) fluconazole administered to healthy volunteers (analogous to a phase I study) and ii) fluconazole administered to people with HIV infection (analogous to a phase II study). Optimal study design techniques were used to develop a parsimonious phase II study design based on minimising dosing arms and number of blood samples per patient that were present from the actual HIV study. Those involved in optimising the study design were blinded to the actual HIV study results. Five (competing) models were developed from the phase I (healthy volunteer) data that were expected to accommodate for possible differences that may be present in the phase II (HIV) study. A parsimonious design was found that performed well across all five competing models and this design was compared against the actual HIV study (full design). The model developed from the optimised parsimonious design was shown to perform as well as the model developed from the HIV full study design. The study design presented illustrates that cost-effective studies that provide acceptable parameter precision are achievable even when there is considerable uncertainty in the model and parameter space. This provides a useful way for phase II studies to be designed based on data obtained during preliminary phase I studies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158788</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Carcinogenicity of monomethylarsonous acid (MMAIII) and sodium arsenate (AsV) and identification of early warning biomarkers.</field><field name="creator">Krishnamohan, Manonmanii</field><field name="description">Although inorganic arsenic is classified as a human carcinogen, lack of an appropriate animal model till recently made it difficult to understand the mechanism of its carcinogenicity. The first inorganic arsenic-induced tumour study was reported by Ng et al. (1998) in C57Bl/6J mice exposed to 500 &#956;g/L sodium arsenate in drinking water. Subsequently, Waalkes et al. (2003) demonstrated arsenite as a transplacental carcinogen in C3H mice exposed to 42.5 or 85 mg/L sodium arsenite between the 8th to 18th days of gestation. Recently monomethylarsonous acid (MMAIII), an intermediate metabolite of the arsenic methylation pathway was shown to be more acutely toxic and genotoxic in both in vitro and in vivo studies. However, its carcinogenic effect was unknown. The first aim of the present study is to investigate whether MMAIII was carcinogenic in a mouse model. The second aim was to investigate whether there was a difference between the spontaneous tumour seen in the controls and arsenic induced tumour which occurred in the test. The third aim was to confirm the carcinogenic effects reported by Ng et al. (1998) by exposing mice to three different concentrations of sodium arsenate (AsV) or Monomethylarsonous acid (MMAIII) in drinking water and to establish a dose response relationship for both arsenate and MMAIII in this mouse strain; and finally to investigate if porphyrin profile can be used as an early warning biomarker for chronic arsenic exposure prior to the onset of carcinogenesis. Female C57Bl/6J mice were exposed to drinking water containing AsV (sodium arsenate) or MMAIII (monomethylarsonous acid) at 0,100, 250 and 500 &#956;g/L ad libitum respectively for two years. 24 hrs pooled urine samples were collected every 2 months for urinary arsenic and porphyrin analyses. Dimethylarsinic acid (DMAV) was found to be a major urinary metabolite in both AsV and MMAIII-treated mice. The study confirmed the carcinogenic effects of AsV in this mouse strain and for the first time, demonstrated MMAIII to be similarly carcinogenic. Significant increases in the level of urinary prophyrins were observed in both AsV and MMAIII-treated mice compared to the control group. Histological examination of tumour masses and tumour bearing organs showed lymphoma was the major type of tumour observed in both control and treated groups. Tumours generally occurred 18 months post treatment. Tumour-bearing animals appeared to remain healthy until the terminal stages of the experiment. The increased incidences of lymphomas were dose dependent for both AsV and MMAIII -treated groups. Other types of tumours and multiplicity of tumours also showed a significant dose response relationship in the AsVtreated groups. Mesenteric lymph node lymphoma and metastatic lymphoma in the liver showed significant dose response relationship in MMAIII-treated mice. The incidence of other types of tumours histiocytic sarcoma was higher in both AsV and MMAIII-treated mice compared to the controls. Plasmacytoid lymphomas were observed only in treated mice. Chronic dermatitis and other degenerative skin lesions were seen only in the AsV and MMAIII-treated mice and not in the control. Keratoacanthoma of the skin, epidermoid carcinoma and rhabdomyosarcoma were only seen in the MMAIII treated mice and not in the AsV-treated mice. Immunohistological examination showed the lymphomas to be of B cell origin. Microarray was performed in selected tumour and non-tumour liver tissues from control, 100 and 500 &#956;g/L groups from both AsV and MMAIII-treated animals. Oncogenes, genes involved in cell division and cell proliferation, chemokines, cyclin dependent kinases, tumour necrosis factor genes (TNF), Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) family genes, Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family genes and DNA damage genes were highly expressed in the MMAIII-treated groups compared to the control group. Genes involved in the Nuclear factor of kappa light chain gene enhancer in B-cells (NF&#954;B) signaling pathway like TNF receptorassociated factor (TRAF), I&#954;BK&#946;, TRAF family member-associated NF-kappa B activator (TANK) and B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) showed more than 32 fold increases in the MMAIII-treated tumours compared to the control tumours. Also inflammatory and B-cell leukaemia and lymphoma genes were expressed in MMAIIItreated tumours only. Genes expressed in the MMAIII-treated tumours showed interesting pathways, the antiapoptotic signaling mediated by the TNF-&#945; induced AKT pathway and prosurvival pathway by TNF-&#945; induced TRAF1 and TRAF2 mediated NF&#954;B activation. The present study is the first low dose chronic study of MMAIII, and both AsV and MMAIII demonstrated to be carcinogenic in C57Bl/6J female mice. Higher incidences of all types of tumours in MMAIII-treated mice and incidences of various types of tumours only in MMAIII-treated groups suggested that MMAIII could be more carcinogenic in vivo than AsV. MMAIII also appeared to have induced a greater variety of genes involved in tumorigenesis compared to AsV. In conclusion, this study supports the contention that the arsenic methylation pathway is not necessarily a detoxification pathway but may in fact in some circumstances enhance the toxicity of the element, and that MMAIII might play a significant role in mammalian arsenic carcinogenicity.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158790</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE ROLE OF GENERALISATION AND CONTEXTUAL CUES IN MOTOR ADAPTATION TO NOVEL VISUAL ENVIRONMENTS</field><field name="creator">Woolley, Daniel Graham</field><field name="description">The series of experiments which form this thesis investigate the generalisation of visuomotor learning. The thesis consists of seven chapters, with the first chapter providing a general introduction to the research program, and the final chapter a summary of the main research findings. Chapters 2 to 6 each represent stand-alone scientific works. Chapter 2 is a review of previous work examining the constraints imposed by the central nervous system on the generalisation of visuomotor learning in behavioural tasks. Particular consideration is given to tasks which have investigated how adaptation to a visuomotor rotation transfers to new visual target locations and movement directions. The role of contextual information in facilitating dual adaptation to opposing novel environments which are initially prone to interference is also discussed. The study described in Chapter 3 first assessed if movements made with a custom designed two degree of freedom isometric torque manipulandum would manifest a typical pattern of motor adaptation when subjects were exposed to a single visuomotor rotation. Two groups of subjects were trained to a single visuomotor rotation, which were of a different magnitude and in opposite directions for each group. Following a rapid improvement in performance to the rotated environment over the course of the training block, directional after-effects were observed on return to the non-rotated environment. Once it was confirmed that our task produced a typical pattern of adaptation to a single visuomotor rotation, we then examined if colour cues provided a suitable source of contextual information to facilitate dual adaptation to two directionally opposed visuomotor rotations of unequal magnitude, which were concurrently presented to the same set of visual targets. A performance improvement over the course of training occurred to only one of the visuomotor rotations, with the possibility of a performance decrement to the other. The absence of after-effects following training indicated that adaptation did not occur in a similar manner to that observed in the single visuomotor rotation groups. The study presented in chapter 4 further investigated constraints on the ability of subjects to dual adapt to opposing visuomotor rotations. We tested if colour cues, a separation in workspace, and presentation schedule, could be used to distinguish between two opposing visuomotor rotations and enable dual adaptation. The opposing visuomotor rotations were either presented in the same region of workspace and each associated with colour cues, presented in different regions of workspace in addition to colour cues, or presented in different regions of workspace only. We also assessed the effectiveness of the workspace separation with both randomised and alternating presentation schedules. The results indicated that colour cues were not effective at enabling dual adaptation when each of the visuomotor rotations was associated with the same region of workspace. When associated with different regions of workspace, however, dual adaptation to the opposing rotations was successful regardless of whether colour cues were present or the type of presentation schedule. The purpose of the study described in chapter 5 was to determine if target amplitude would serve as an appropriate source of contextual information to enable dual adaptation. This was tested by associating two opposing visuomotor rotations with a set of visual targets that were matched in angular direction but of different amplitude. The two sets of visual target amplitudes also resulted in movements of different amplitude. The results indicated that visual target and movement amplitude is not a suitable source of contextual information to enable dual adaptation. Interference was observed in groups who were exposed to opposing visuomotor rotations, or a visuomotor rotation and no rotation, both when the onset of the visuomotor rotations was sudden, or occurred gradually over the course of training. Furthermore, the pattern of interference indicated that the inability to dual adapt was the result of the generalisation of learning between the two visual target and movement amplitudes. Chapter 6 describes a series of experiments in which we used a dual adaptation paradigm to assess if distinct patterns of generalisation for visuomotor learning were manifested in the visual and motor workspaces. By manipulating the position of the visual targets and the magnitude and direction of the visuomotor rotations, we were able to independently determine the extent of generalisation in the visual and motor workspaces during the adaptation phase of the task. When the set of targets associated with each of the opposing visuomotor rotations were near in the visual workspace and separate in the motor workspace, extensive interference was observed. In the reverse scenario when the targets were separate in the visual workspace and near in the motor workspace, only a limited degree of interference was present. The dominance of generalisation in the visual workspace was supported by the result that dual adaptation to opposing visuomotor rotations was found to occur when separate targets in the visual workspace required movements to overlapping targets in the motor workspace.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158791</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Journey to Re-Empowerment: A Phenomenological Description of the Experiences of Male Victims of Crime</field><field name="creator">Haynes, Jennifer</field><field name="description">There has been, to date, minimal research on the experiences of male victims of crime. The research into gender differences in the experiences of criminal victimization have tended to focus on women leaving the male experience to be extrapolated from that of women. This study uses phenomenology to describe the experiences of men who are criminally victimized. The men described an eight phase process of victimization: &#147;What Happened Was&#148;, the &#147;Emotional Wince&#148;, &#147;He Stole My Power&#148;, &#147;Let Me Tell You How It Felt&#148;, Coming To An Understanding Of The Crime&#148;, &#147;Regaining Control&#148;, &#147;Consciously Taking Back Power&#148; and &#147;It&#146;s Over Now, It&#146;s Not Important&#148;. The main goal of the men was to reclaim their lost sense of personal empowerment, stolen in the instance of the crime. The men also had a need to talk through the crime and its aftermath. A supportive listener assisted the man through the process to re-empowerment, whilst a non-supportive listener could complicate the criminal experience, invalidate the victim and result in the man either disengaging from the support process or adopting the non-confirmatory reactions of the listener. Thus the listener held considerable power. Recommendations include police in-service training and the increased use of community conferencing. It is particularly recommended that some attention be paid to rehabilitating the term &#147;victim&#148; given that men do not easily accept the notion of being a victim.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158792</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Around 1988: History and/as Fiction and the Australian Bicentenary</field><field name="creator">Marks de Marques, Eduardo</field><field name="description">Throughout the 1980s, Australia was preparing for its biggest national celebration yet: that of the Bicentenary of the arrival of the first European settlers. The Australian Bicentenary can be seen as a media event, which is defined as a construct, rather than a representation of the social order (Couldry 56) and, as such, this generated an interesting conflict between the many different, sometimes contrasting, versions of Australian history to be presented as official. The controversy was mainly centred on the representation of Aborigines, ethnic minorities and, to a certain degree, the involvement of women throughout history which, in turn, exposed the fragility of historical narratives as truth and fact. Academic historians were well aware of the necessity to reorient the historiographic process since the so-called poststructural turn, but as these debates were strongly connected to the Bicentenary, this was arguably the first time that the Australian public was made aware of them. An interesting consequence of the shift of these debates from academia to society was the massive increase in the writing and publication of historical fiction. Novelists became key figures in the process of reassessing and reconstructing Australian history, demonstrating, thus, the fluidity of the boundaries between history and fiction. This thesis examines the many ways in which historical fiction was used to question and undermine the &#147;legend&#148; form of Australian national identity (as defined, primarily, by Russel Ward) as creator and holder of history, how this dynamic connects with the political project of the Labor government of the 1980s in its attempt to promote historic heteroglossia and social polyphony in the continent, and how the Bicentenary acted as an important catalyst for these debates. Chapter One provides a context of the political and institutional making of the Bicentenary from the creation of the Australian Bicentennial Authority in 1979, also looking at the historical and broader literary projects associated with it. Chapter Two examines in more detail the changes in the discipline of history (from constructionist to reconstructionist to deconstructionist modes of historiography) and the postmodern influence of metafictional historiography. The following chapters are analytical and examine the many ways in which the classical notion of Australian identity was questioned by novelists. Chapter Three focuses on the rise and influence of second-wave feminism in history and historical fiction. Chapter Four deals with the displacement of manliness from the defining centre of identity. Chapter Five looks at the notion of Aboriginality and how it was being defined and redefined in the 1980s. Chapter Six examines the rise of ethnic literatures in the early stages of Australian multiculturalism. The conclusion briefly looks at how these debates about the boundaries between history and fiction have changed in the 1990s and 2000s, paying particular attention to the contemporary resurgence of these debates seen since the publication of The Secret River in 2005.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158793</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of labour hire arrangements: A study of Queensland labour hire agencies</field><field name="creator">Graham, Daniel</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Labor -- Laws and legislation -- Queensland</field><field name="subject">Labor contractors -- Legal status, laws, etc. -- Queensland</field><field name="subject">Labor contractors -- Queensland</field><field name="subject">Employment agencies -- Laws and legislation -- Queensland</field><field name="subject">Employment agencies -- Queensland.</field><field name="subject">Industrial relations -- Queensland.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158794</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA BIOFILM FORMATION IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS AND THE EFFECT OF MUCOIDY AND AZITHROMYCIN</field><field name="creator">Semple, Katherine Leah</field><field name="description">Chronic lung infection with P. aeruginosa is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF). Most CF patients initially acquire a unique nonmucoid strain of P. aeruginosa. The subsequent conversion to a mucoid phenotype is associated with an accelerated decline in lung function. This thesis explored the role of mucoid and non-mucoid P. aeruginosa biofilm formation in CF lung disease. The initial objective was to find a reliable way of quantifying biofilm formation in vitro to assess P. aeruginosa clinical isolates. A microtitre assay was modified to study biofilm formation by isogenic mucoid and non-mucoid strains from clinical isolates. The CF isolates were slow to form biofilm resulting in the assay being extended to 72 hours. A group of genomically diverse P. aeruginosa isolates formed different amounts of biofilm in vitro. Genotype did not predict biofilm morphotype suggesting factors such as differential gene expression are important. Mucoid conversion and biofilm formation are both important in the pathogenesis of CF bronchiectasis, however the relationship between the two is not clear. Recent studies comparing genetically manipulated isogenic mucoid and non-mucoid P. aeruginosa stains reached conflicting conclusions. Multiple clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa have not been examined before. Biofilm produced by isogenic mucoid and non-mucoid P. aeruginosa strains isolated from CF patients (n=10) was quantified to determine if: (1) CF isolates produced different amounts of biofilm; and (2) mucoid clinical isolates form more biofilm than their isogenic non-mucoid parent strain. Factors with a role in biofilm formation: flagellar motility; twitching motility and growth were assessed. The reproducibility of the modified microtitre assay was confirmed (Spearman&#146;s correlation coefficient 0.884 p&lt;0.001). CF P. aeruginosa isolates displayed significant differences in biofilm formation, and took &gt;24 hours to form significant amounts. CF P. aeruginosa isolates showed reduced motility and planktonic growth compared to the laboratory reference strain PAO1. Isolates from three patients did not form any biofilm at 72hours. These isolates were not deficient in growth, flagellar activity or twitching motility. There was no difference in biofilm formation between isogenic mucoid and non-mucoid isolates (p= 0.80 at 24 hours, 0.96 at 48 hours and 0.74 at 72 hours). Mucoid P. aeruginosa CF isolates did not produce more biofilm than isogenic non-mucoid isolates. Long term Azithromycin (AZM), a macrolide antibiotic, improves outcomes in CF patients. The mechanisms remain unclear but may include antibiofilm effects on P. aeruginosa. The effect of sub-MIC AZM (2Gg/ml, 8Gg/ml and 32Gg/ml) on 72 hour biofilm formation by seven isogenic mucoid and non-mucoid P. aeruginosa isolates from CF patients was studied. Biomass, as indicated by crystal violet (CV) staining, was determined by the modified microtitre assay. AZM resulted in increased P. aeruginosa biofilm biomass. There was a 150% increase in non-mucoid isolate biomass with exposure to AZM 32Gg/ml (95% CI for difference 0.10 to 0.66, p=0.005). Mucoid isolates showed a similar (91%) increase in biomass with AZM although this did not achieve statistical significance (95% CI -0.039 to 0.94, p=0.079). Active metabolism by biofilm bacteria was measured using the respiratory indicator 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (CTC). Overall AZM had no significant effect on CTC staining (p=0.141). However, when CTC activity was considered per unit of biomass (CTC/CV), there was a significant reduction in activity seen with increasing AZM concentration in mucoid and non-mucoid isolates (p=0.007). Although AZM caused an increase in biomass, there was reduction in the metabolic activity of the biofilm. There was no difference between isogenic mucoid and nonmucoid isolates in response to AZM (p=0.514), suggesting the effect of Azithromycin on biofilms is independent of mucoidy. Using a reliable and reproducible modified microtitre plate assay the above data show that mucoid clinical P. aeruginosa isolates did not form more biofilm than the isogenic non-mucoid parent strain. Clinical P. aeruginosa isolates exposed to AZM produced thicker biofilms with reduced metabolic activity. The effects were similar in both mucoid and non-mucoid isogenic isolates suggesting AZM activity is independent of mucoidy. Enhanced biofilm formation does not appear to explain the accelerated lung disease seen in CF patients after mucoid conversion of P. aeruginosa. The above studies highlight the complexity of biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa and the need to evaluate clinical isolates.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158795</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Psychotherapy for people with chronic schizophrenia</field><field name="creator">Berquier, Anne Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Multiple difficulties have been identified with current psychotherapeutic models and treatments for schizophrenia. The current study reviewed the validity and the influence of aetiological theories and diagnosis of primary and secondary symptoms on psychotherapeutic models and treatments, and the relative efficacy of different psychotherapeutic treatments. Based on the identified difficulties associated with current psychotherapeutic models and treatments for schizophrenia, a new psychotherapeutic treatment for people with chronic schizophrenia based on the principles of Supportive and Analytic Psychotherapies was developed, conducted and evaluated. In this study, a treatment programme was developed to evaluate the effects of ward Supportive Psychotherapy and individual Supportive Psychotherapy and Analytic Psychotherapy on positive symptoms, negative symptoms, general psychopathology, behavioural disturbances, client satisfaction with treatment, and psychosocial variables in a group of hospitalised participants with chronic schizophrenia. The current study sought to address identified problems by assessing both primary and secondary symptoms, using a lengthy follow-up period, using therapists trained and experienced in the therapy under consideration, and including detailed descriptions of procedures for both therapies. Fifty-six participants residing in a tertiary mental institution consented to participate in the study. Participants had previously been treated with usual care, Behaviour Therapy, and some Cognitive Behaviour Therapy conducted by a trained and experienced therapist. The therapy was conducted in two phases. Phase 1 involved ward Supportive Psychotherapy (ward SPT) for all participants while, for Phase 2, participants were randomly assigned to either individual Supportive Psychotherapy (SPT) or Analytic Psychotherapy (APT). Efficacy of the therapies was evaluated using the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) measures of positive symptoms, negative symptoms and general psychopathology, and measures of behavioural disturbances (incidents of self-harm, physical and verbal aggression, seclusions, absconding and days on constant observation). Levels of regular and extra medication were also recorded during each phase. Participants were asked to complete a Client Satisfaction Questionnaire specifically developed for the study. Psychosocial variables such as rates of successful discharge into the community and rates of completed suicide were also recorded for two years prior to instigation of the current treatment, during the current treatment phases, and for a two-year follow-up period. Results of repeated measures MANOVA's and planned comparisons for each of the PANSS scales showed that all scales decreased significantly over time for both therapy groups with overall measures decreasing following each phase of treatment. Participants in the APTgroup showed greater decreases in symptom severity for Positive Symptoms and for General Psychopathology for the group with high levels of initial behavioural disturbance. For all PANSS scales, participants with high levels of behavioural disturbance showed a significant reduction in symptom severity following ward SPT and individual therapy and at follow-up assessment. Results of Discriminant Analyses of individual items in the General Psychopathology Scale showed that depression and anxiety were the most important variables at the pre-treatment phase, but were no longer significant at any other assessment time. Similar decreases were observed for levels of behavioural disturbances, regular and extra medication levels, completed suicides and rates of worker's compensation claims for staff following assault for each treatment phase. Results for client satisfaction showed a significant increase during the Ward Psychotherapy treatment and showed a further increase following individual therapy. A differential increase in client satisfaction with treatment by group over time was found with the APT group showing a larger increase in satisfaction with treatment than the SPT group. These results were maintained when the item specific to assistance with past problems was removed prior to analysis. Results of the current study strongly support the efficacy of both Supportive Psychotherapy and Analytic Psychotherapy in reducing symptom severity, behavioural disturbances, and the associated distress to people with schizophrenia, psychiatric staff, family members, and carers. Results are also discussed in terms of the limitations of the current study, that is, the lack of an adequate control group, and the possible effects of therapist characteristics on participation rates, retention and efficacy.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158796</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implementation and Evaluation of the Parenting Program Stepping Stones Triple P for children with Autism Spectrum Disorders</field><field name="creator">Whittingham, Koa Lou</field><field name="description">This research project consisted of an evaluation of the parenting program Stepping Stones Triple P for the Autism Spectrum Disorders population as well as an investigation of the role that parental attributions play in determining treatment outcome. Whilst the Triple P Positive Parenting Program has a large evidence base (Sanders, 1999; Sanders, Markie-Dadds, Tully &amp; Bor, 2000) and preliminary evidence indicates that Stepping Stones is also efficacious (Roberts, Mazzucchelli, Studman &amp; Sanders, 2006), to date neither Stepping Stones nor Triple P have been evaluated with the ASD population. Although specific parenting programs have been used with the ASD population for a number of years (Koegel, Schreibman, Britten, Burke, &amp; O'Neill, 1982) the experience of parents of children with ASD in standard Parenting Programs that are more widely disseminated has not been researched. Parental attributions refer to a parent's search for the meaning of their child's behaviour and the parent's use of attributed causal factors in framing their response to their child's behaviour (Bugental, New, Johnston, &amp; Silvester, 1998). There is some evidence that parental attributions are associated with parenting styles (Dix, Ruble, Grusec, &amp; Nixon, 1986; Smith &amp; O'Leary, 1995), child behaviour (Roberts, &amp; Hallbert-Rowe, 1992) and outcomes in child mental health treatment (Watson, 1986). Morrissey-Kane and Prinz (1999) developed the "beginnings" of a model of the relationship between parental attributions and parental engagement in child mental health treatment. They focus on three of the four dimensions of Weiner (1980), namely locus, stability and controllability. Initially, a pilot study was conducted that involved forty-two parents of children with ASD viewing a DVD showing Stepping Stones parenting strategies. Parents were asked to rate each strategy for acceptability, usability and their intention to try the strategy. Additionally, parental attributions and parental perceived control were explored as possible barriers to positive evaluations of the strategies. A focus group of parents was used to gather qualitative information. The results from the pilot study indicated that parent response to Stepping Stones was generally positive. In addition, it was found that parental attributions of child behaviour to uncontrollable factors predicted higher ratings of usability. The second study was a randomised controlled trial of Stepping Stones for the ASD population. Fifty-nine families participated in this trial and were randomly allocated to treatment and wait-list control groups. The results demonstrate significant improvements in child behaviour, parenting styles, parental satisfaction and conflict about parenting as well as a sleeper effect for parental efficacy. The treatment effect was maintained at follow-up six months later and for a third of participants the change in child behaviour or parenting styles was clinically significant. The third study focused on the role of parental attributions in determining treatment outcome. The fifty-nine families that participated in the trial also completed measures of parental attributions before and after completing Stepping Stones. A tendency for parents to generalise from ASD-related behaviour to misbehaviour was identified as well as the presence of the positivity effect for stability and controllability attributions but not for locus attributions. A relationship between parental autistic traits and internal parent-referent attributions for ASD-related behaviour and misbehaviour was demonstrated. Following participation in Stepping Stones parents were significantly less likely to believe that their child's misbehaviour was caused by factors intrinsic to their child and significantly more likely to believe that their child's ASD-related behaviour may change with time. Thus, Stepping Stones was found to alter parental attributions in a way that promotes parental engagement according to the model of Morrissey-Kane and Prinz (1999). Parental attributions before the intervention significantly predicted decreases in parental overreactivity and parental verbosity during treatment. The changes in parental overreactivity are consistent with the model of Morrissey-Kane and Prinz (1999), however, the changes in parental verbosity are not. It is suggested that the model needs to be expanded to include a greater variety of dysfunctional parenting styles, not merely over-reactivity. Overall, this research project has demonstrated that Stepping Stones Triple P is an effective intervention for behavioural problems and dysfunctional parenting within the ASD population. In addition, the evidence suggests that Stepping Stones Triple P can alter parental attributions such that the program is more likely to promote parental engagement.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158797</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epidemiological Factors in the Development of Epithelial Ovarian and Related Cancers</field><field name="creator">Jordan, Susan J.</field><field name="description">Background Epithelial ovarian cancer is associated with high mortality because it is frequently diagnosed late when treatment is unlikely to be curative. Efforts to facilitate early diagnosis have been hampered by a limited understanding of ovarian cancer pathogenesis. In particular, evidence for defined precursor lesions preceding cancer development is lacking and complicated by the possibility that pre-cancerous changes vary according to the histological subtype of ovarian cancer. Although epithelial ovarian cancer encompasses a number of histologically distinct subtypes, traditionally it has been considered as a single neoplastic entity. Evidence of some aetiological and molecular differences, particularly between the serous and mucinous subtypes, suggests that this is not the case and these subtypes may arise via different pathological sequences. The existence of benign and borderline ovarian tumours of both subtypes allows for the possibility that both develop via a classic adenoma-carcinoma sequence. However, despite apparent aetiological similarities between serous borderline and serous invasive cancers, molecular differences suggest they are not developmentally linked; how serous benign tumours are related to either borderline or invasive tumours is unknown. Serous invasive ovarian cancers in fact appear histologically and clinically more similar to serous fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancers, so it is likely that insight into the relationship between these three cancers will inform our understanding of how all three develop. Mucinous invasive and borderline ovarian tumours on the other hand, may have molecular and aetiological similarities, although little is known about benign mucinous tumours. In order to increase our understanding of the relationships between the epithelial ovarian tumours and related cancers, risk factors were investigated across the spectrum of serous and mucinous epithelial ovarian tumours and related serous gynaecological cancers. Methods Data from an Australian population-based case-control study of ovarian cancer and from a parallel study of benign ovarian tumours were used to compare risk factors across tumour types. The studies included 1508 control women from the general population as well as women with histologically confirmed benign (n=230), borderline (n=146) and invasive (n=623) serous ovarian tumours; those with benign (n=133), borderline (n=147) and invasive (n=43) mucinous ovarian tumours; and those with fallopian tube (n=45) and primary peritoneal (n=129) cancers. Participating women completed comprehensive health and lifestyle questionnaires and provided a sample of blood for genetic analyses. Unconditional multiple logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals and polytomous regression was used to directly compare the tumour types. Results As expected, parity, breast-feeding and use of hormonal contraceptives were inversely associated with decreased risks of invasive serous ovarian cancers. This was also the case for fallopian tube cancers. In contrast, the risk of peritoneal cancer was increased amongst parous women, while breast-feeding was unrelated to risk. Furthermore, obesity was associated with a doubling of risk of peritoneal cancer but not ovarian or fallopian tube cancer. The risk of serous benign and borderline tumours was inversely related to parity, but unrelated to hormonal contraceptive use or breast-feeding; both were associated with obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome and smoking. Parous women also had a decreased risk of benign, borderline and invasive mucinous tumours; while smoking and, to a lesser extent, obesity at age 20 increased the risk of the mucinous tumours. Conclusions The results suggest that serous invasive ovarian cancers have similar risk factors to fallopian tube cancers, but are aetiologically distinct not only from mucinous ovarian tumours, but also serous benign and borderline tumours and primary peritoneal cancers. These findings may have implications for our understanding how ovarian cancers develop. They suggest that serous invasive ovarian cancers are unlikely to arise from benign and borderline tumours but probably develop in similar ways to fallopian tube cancer. Primary peritoneal cancers appear have aetiologically differences suggesting that they may arise via a different pathogenic sequence. In general patterns of risk factors across mucinous benign, borderline and invasive ovarian tumours were consistent with an adenoma-to-carcinoma sequence as the developmental pathway for this subtype of ovarian cancer. Similarly, risks factors for serous benign and borderline ovarian tumours were consistent with the possibility that benign serous tumours can be precursors to borderline serous cancers. Overall, it seems likely that epithelial ovarian cancer is not one but several diseases, which probably arise through different sequences of pathological lesions. These findings may ultimately have implications for both primary cancer prevention and screening programs aimed at early cancer detection.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158798</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecological effects of the cyanobacterial toxin cylindrospermopsin</field><field name="creator">Seifert, Marc</field><field name="description">The occurrence of nuisance growths or blooms of cyanobacteria in reservoirs and other waterbodies poses a potential risk to the quality of water as many species are capable of producing secondary metabolites that may be toxic or impart unpleasant taste and odours. Cylindrospermopsin, a potent cytotoxic alkaloid produced by numerous cyanobacteria including Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, has gained increasing attention following its implication as the causative agent in a mass human intoxication event and numerous livestock mortalities. Cylindrospermopsin was also considered to pose significant risks to aquatic organisms, although the role of the cyanotoxin in aquatic ecosystems had received little attention. This thesis aimed to address this significant knowledge gap through a series of toxicity assays to determine the effects of the cyanotoxin in the reservoir and it receiving waters downstream within an ecological risk assessment framework. The cosmopolitan benthic cyanobacterium Lyngbya wollei, collected from Yabba Creek and the Brisbane River, was found to produce cylindrospermopsin (33 &lt;g g-1 dry weight) and its naturally occurring analogue deoxy-cylindrospermopsin (550 &lt;g g-1 dry weight). This is the first report of the production of the cylindrospermopsin analogues by a benthic cyanobacterium or any species of the Oscillatoriales. Screening of three other benthic cyanobacteria also identified, for the first time, toxicity associated with an Australian strain of Phormidium aerugineo-caeruleum. No known cyanotoxins were detected, although the observed effects were similar to that of neurotoxins. The comparative toxicity of the three cylindrospermopsin alkaloids; cylindrospermopsin, epi-cylindrospermopsin and deoxy-cylindrospermopsin was assessed using the brine shrimp nauplii bioassay. The toxicity of epi-cylindrospermopsin was an order of magnitude greater than cylindrospermopsin, although deoxy-cylindrospermopsin was substantially less toxic. These results compared favourably with the mouse bioassay and indicate that the hydroxyl group is required for the uptake or toxicity of the metabolite in whole organisms. The bioconcentration and bioaccumulation of cylindrospermopsin and deoxycylindrospermopsin was identified in a range of aquatic flora and fauna. Of particular interest was the discovery of cylindrospermopsin in the muscle and liver tissue of the eeltailed catfish (Tandanus tandanus) but not other fish species collected at the same site. This indicates that rather than extracellular uptake of the toxin, the source of cylindrospermopsin is dietary and possibly taken up through the consumption of freshwater bivalves. Importantly it suggests that cylindrospermopsin may be transferred through the aquatic food web. The accumulation of cylindrospermopsin in the tissue of a popular angling fish species also has implication for the exposure of humans to contaminated seafood. The toxicological effects of cylindrospermopsin and extracts of C. raciborskii were investigated through a series of acute exposure direct toxicity assessments using a floating macrophyte, green algae and a range of aquatic invertebrates from various trophic levels. Additionally, the effect of sub-lethal exposure was assessed using the growth and photosynthesis of green algae and an aquatic macrophyte, and the survival and reproductive success of the cladoceran Ceriodaphnia dubia. The effect of pure cylindrospermopsin was generally less that of C. raciborskii containing a comparable concentration of the toxin. An exception to this was the survival and reproduction of the cladoceran, Ceriodaphnia dubia, which may have benefited from increased levels of nutrition, in the form of bacteria and other micro-organisms, present in the extract. This may also explain the dominance of smaller daphnids during blooms of toxic C. raciborskii. Overall, concentrations of cylindrospermopsin required to elicit adverse effects were typically well above those which can be expected to occur in reservoirs. There is little evidence for significant ecological effects from exposure to cylindrospermopsin alone at concentrations below 100 &lt;g L-1. However, it is likely that other bioactive compounds present in C. raciborskii extracts and cells contributed to the toxicity of the cyanobacterium. The risk posed by cylindrospermopsin alone to aquatic organisms in reservoirs and their receiving waters is therefore considered low. Water quality guidelines or trigger levels for the protection of aquatic ecosystems based solely on the cylindrospermopsin concentration may therefore not capture the potential risk of exposure to entire C. raciborskii cells. Nevertheless, a total (i.e. intra- and extracellular) concentration of cylindrospermopsin of 100 &lt;g L-1 is suggested as an interim trigger level for the protection of aquatic ecosystems, although this should be revised following additional studies into the sub-lethal effects of chronic exposure to cylindrospermopsin and C. raciborskii.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158799</field></doc><doc><field name="title">REVISITING MOTIVATION IN ESP MASS EDUCATION (An Action Research Study at Trisakti University in Jakarta, Indonesia)</field><field name="creator">Lakawa, Agustin</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study is twofold. First, it aims to contribute to Second Language Acquisition (SLA) literature on motivation by investigating motivation among students enrolled in compulsory courses in English for Specific Purposes (ESP) in an Indonesian university setting. Second, by conducting an action research study it aims to find ways to improve the present circumstances within compulsory ESP courses in the industrial technology faculty of a large private university in Jakarta, Indonesia. The teaching of ESP at the university is faculty-based and aims to develop reading and writing skills and structural knowledge of English using language samples from content areas related to disciplines within each faculty. ESP courses were introduced on the assumption that interest in the content of the ESP language subject/course would motivate learners. However, at the outset of this study the students lacked motivation to learn ESP. The study revealed a large number of administrative, logistical and educational issues that have led to less than optimal learning conditions and have impacted on learner motivation. In the cycles of action research that were conducted as part of this study, interventions addressed issues relating to the content of materials used in language classes. The data presented show that the content of the new materials proved to be a motivating factor. SLA related findings include that while students were found to be instrumentally motivated, validating the intended purpose of ESP courses, their increased effort in the classroom also coincided with increased effort in their self-initiated informal learning activities outside the classroom, behaviour associated with integrative motivation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158800</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Men and manliness on the frontier: Queensland and British Columbia in the mid-nineteenth century</field><field name="creator">Hogg, Robert Paul</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Frontier and pioneer life -- British Columbia -- History -- 19th century.</field><field name="subject">Frontier and pioneer life -- Queensland -- History -- 19th century.</field><field name="subject">Pioneers -- British Columbia -- History -- 19th century.</field><field name="subject">Pioneers -- Queensland -- History -- 19th century</field><field name="subject">Masculinity -- Great Britain -- History -- 19th century.</field><field name="subject">Masculinity -- British Columbia -- History -- 19th century.</field><field name="subject">Masculinity -- Queensland -- History -- 19th century.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158801</field></doc><doc><field name="title">FAMILIAL AGGREGATION OF HUMAN HELMINTH INFECTION: A FOCUS ON GENETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY TO SCHISTOSOMIASIS JAPONICA AND ASSOCIATED MARKERS OF DISEASE</field><field name="creator">Ellis, Magda</field><field name="description">Human helminthiases are common in China, especially in rural areas where sanitation conditions are poor. The soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura, are two of the most common STHs in China and are found predominantly in the southern provinces. Also highly endemic to the Yangtze River basin region is Schistosoma japonicum. This research was primarily undertaken to investigate the genetic susceptibility of helminth infection in the Poyang Lake region, Jiangxi Province,, China with a particular focus on the genetics underlying risk of S. japonicum re-infection and acute infection. Further, candidate markers of fibrosis were investigated to assess their potential for assessing disease stage and the progression of schistosomiasis. A cross-sectional study was carried out in a population of 3205 individuals belonging to 498 families from 5 villages in the Poyang Lake. All individuals were assessed for helminth infection and interviewed to collect information on potential risk factors for infection. The prevalences for Ascaris lumbricoides, Schistosoma japonicum and Trichuris trichiura were 30.9%, 15.7% and 47%, respectively. Water contact was identified as a major risk factor for the three helminth species. In addition, significant associations were observed between T. trichiura infection and both A. lumbroicoides and S. japonicum infection. Variance components analysis was undertaken to investigate the aggregation of single, co- and multiple helminth species infections. While A. lumbricoides aggregated predominantly at a household level, T. trichiura was shown to cluster in families. Both genetic and household effects were important in determining the risk of infection with S. japonicum. Variance components analysis for A. lumbricoides/T. trichiura and S. japonicum/T. trichiura co- infections indicated a significant domestic environmental effect, attributable for 32.7% and 43.2% of the coinfection risk, respectively. The risk of infection with multiple helminth species, although mainly environmentally influenced, also demonstrated significant involvement of genetic and household components. The results of this study indicated that shared household was a major contributing risk factor for helminth co- infections and that susceptibility to one helminth infection was not completely independent of another, indicating that common genetic factors underlying infection with multiple helminth species may exist. Further, the results of the study emphasise the need for improved sanitation and hygiene conditions to prevent parasite transmission. Genetic studies of human susceptibility to Schistosoma infections have previously identified a genetic locus determining infection intensity with S. mansoni, in the 5q31-33 region of the human genome which contains the gene-cluster encoding IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 cytokines. In a nested case-control study, 31 tagged SNPs across this region were genotyped in individuals from the Poyang Lake area identified as putatively susceptible to re- infection or acute infection, or resistant to infection with S. japonicum. The results indicated no significant association at a global level between re-infection susceptibility and any individual tagged-SNPs or haplotype blocks in the IL-4, IL-5 or IL-13 genes. Two SNPs in IL-5, however, demonstrated a globally significant association with susceptibility to acute infection. These SNPs belong to the same haplotype block located in the 3&#146;-UTR region of IL-5 and suggest that variants in this region of IL-5 may modulate the acute response to infection observed in these individuals. Soluble ICAM-1 and TNF receptors I and II have shown association with liver inflammation in murine studies of schistosomal infection and in human hepatic schistosomiasis mansoni. Serum levels of sICAM-1, TNFR-I and TNFR-II were measured in 35 acute patients, 45 chronic patients, 34 advanced patients and 20 nonexposed controls. There were significantly elevated levels of all three markers in acute and advanced patients compared to the chronic and control groups. Both sTNFR-II and sICAM-1 levels correlated positively with infection intensity and there were also significant correlations observed between sICAM-1 levels and eosinophil count. Although there were significantly higher levels of antigen-specific IgG4 and IgG in infected individuals compared to controls, there was no correlation with infection intensity or between the acute and chronic groups. In conclusion, an active humoral immune response is typical of current infection whilst sTNFRs and sICAM-1 are involved in liver inflammation and disease progression. Consequently, measurement of sTNFR-II and sICAM-1 levels in serum could serve as additional markers for the diagnosis of acute stage disease and the monitoring of hepatic inflammation in human schistosomiasis japonica.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158678</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular ecology of rumen bacterial populations in steers fed molasses diets</field><field name="creator">Alvarez, Maria-Ximena Tolosa</field><field name="description">The rumen bacterial community structure and phylogenetic diversity of fluid- and solidassociated bacteria (FAB and SAB, respectively) was investigated in Brahman-cross steers fed several diets based on low-quality pangola grass hay and molasses. Diets used in Experiment 1 (as fed basis) consisted of 100% pangola hay (0M), 75:25 hay/molasses (25M), 50:50 hay/molasses (50M), and 25:75 hay/molasses (75M). Diets used in Experiment 2 (as fed basis) consisted of molasses/hay (HM, 50:50), hay/molasses/urea (MU, 50:48:2), hay/molasses/casein (MCAS, 50:45:5), and hay/molasses/cottonseed meal (MCSM, 30:50:20). In both experiments, four rumen-cannulated steers were fed once daily at 0800 h. Steers were allocated to one of the four diets in a 4x4 Latin square design. Rumen fluid samples were taken during the initial period of molasses introduction (Experiment 1). Following adaptation to the diets, rumen fluid and solid phase samples were taken immediately prior to feeding and 8 h after feeding over two consecutive days (Experiments 1 and 2). Rumen FAB and SAB communities were analysed by amplification of the V2-V3 region of the 16S rDNA gene, followed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Bacterial diversity was estimated by applying statistical ecology indices to DGGE data. Intake, digestibility, microbial protein production, fluid and solid fractional outflow rate, pH, NH3N and VFA content in the rumen were also measured. Monitoring changes in FAB structure during the period of gradual introduction of molasses to the diets indicated that bacteria responded slowly to a dietary change. Soon after the start of the dietary change (days 1-8), the appearance of transient dominant bands (species) became evident as these bands were not present three weeks after the diet change. Comparison of morning and afternoon DGGE bacterial profiles from steers adapted to the diets fed in Experiments 1 and 2 (after 27 and 20 days on the new diet, respectively) revealed that the structure of the rumen bacterial community was particularly stable over at least two days (days 27 and 28, for Experiment 1, and days 20 and 21 Experiment 2). These results indicate that the sampling time had no influence on the assessment of the bacterial community structure and diversity once the animal had adapted to a diet. The inclusion of different amounts of molasses in the diet resulted in significantly different FAB and SAB population structures, in terms of DGG banding patterns (i.e., differences in position and intensity of bands DGGE in the profile). The main finding in terms of estimated species diversity in samples of rumen contents from Experiment 1 was that steers fed hay-only (0M) or hay plus low levels of molasses (25M) displayed a more diverse FAB population when compared to steers consuming high levels of molasses (50M and 75M). Therefore, it appears that replacing slowly degradable low-quality fibre for readily available non-structural carbohydrate resulted in decreased FAB species diversity, as determined by diversity indexes calculated from the number and intensity of DGGE bands in each profile. FAB DGGE patterns were significantly different to SAB patterns for the 0M diet but not for the 75M diet. Feeding a diet of pangola hay and molasses (50:50) with or without different nitrogen sources (Experiment 2) had no effect on FAB structure; however, differences in SAB structure were detected between the HM and MCAS. The response of the SAB population to casein addition, a highly degradable true protein source may be associated with a greater supply of branched-chain fatty acids that became available after degradation of branched-chain amino acids. Diversity indices for FAB and SAB samples collected in Experiment 2 showed no diet or steer effect. No differences were found in the structure of FAB and SAB between steers consuming the same diet. Phylogenetic diversity in samples from Experiment 1 was assessed by cloning, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of excised DGGE bands. Between one and four bands were excised per profile. Dominant FAB and unique SAB bands were reamplified and cloned. A total of 269 partial 16S rDNA sequences were retrieved from FAB and SAB DGGE clone libraries. Phylogenetic relationships between unique sequences and their closest culturable rumen bacteria were estimated. The majority of the phylotypes (47-67%) belonged to the Firmicutes phylum and this result was independent of the diet the steer was fed. Phylotypes belonging to Bacteroidetes represented between 33-44% of the total phylotypes. The following phyla were also represented: Fibrobacteria (6%; detected in 25M only), and the proposed OP11 phylogenetic division (3% in both 0M and 25M diets). The majority of the phylotypes identified in this study were unknown species. Some of the phylotypes identified, although unknown, had been reported to be present in the gastrointestinal system of native African herbivores, Norwegian reindeer, and cattle and sheep consuming diverse diets. Of the 90 phylotypes identified, four had sequences identical to those of known culturable bacteria. These were: Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens (detected in 0M, 25M and 75M diets), Clostridium polysaccharolyticum (25M and 75M diets), Ruminococcus albus (0M diet), and Fibrobacter succinogenes (25M diet). Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that dominant bacterial populations in the rumen of steers fed hay and hay plus a small amount of molasses were different from those recovered from the rumen of steers fed high levels of molasses. In particular, phylotypes related to unclassified clostridia appeared to be present only when the proportion of hay in the diets was high; whereas Selenomonas-Quinella type bacteria were more prevalent in the rumen of steers fed high-molasses diets. The presence of Quinella ovalis-like bacteria as dominant organisms in high-molasses diets was confirmed by real time PCR enumeration and microscopy. Q. ovalis-like bacteria tended to increase as the percentage of molasses in the diet increased while the total rumen bacterial populations remained relatively stable. Q. ovalis-like bacteria comprised between 1 and 61% of the total bacteria population (20% average) in 75M. DM intake and digestible organic matter increased quadratically while DM digestibility of the diet, MPS production and the efficiency of MPS increased linearly with increasing level of molasses in the diet. Molasses inclusion in the diet had no effect on rumen pH, ammonia and VFA concentration in the rumen fluid, urine pH or fluid and solid outflow rate. Significant correlations were found between rumen fluid pH, total and individual volatile fatty acids content, fractional outflow rate of the fluid and solid phases, microbial protein synthesis, Isotricha population and changes in abundance of certain rumen FAB phylotypes. Thus the populations of Prevotella ruminicola-like bacteria were negatively correlated to MPS. It is possible that these bacteria, which were abundant in the rumen of low quality hay-fed steers, had low growth rates. The positive correlation between the populations of Quinella ovalis-like bacteria (dominant in 50M and 75M diets) and the proportion of propionate in the rumen fluid suggested that these organisms were associated with propionate production. The populations of Ruminococcus albus and Fibrobacter succinogenes were linked to the abundance of the ciliate Isotricha. The results from the present study have shown that the level of molasses influenced the structure of rumen bacterial populations. Phylogenetic shifts in dominant bacteria in contrasting diets were also identified. An increase in molasses resulted in significant changes in nutritional parameters, in particular, an increase in the supply of microbial protein, which the phylogenetic study has shown is comprised of different bacterial species and proportions thereof.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158677</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What Should Happen to the Future Accommodation of the Elderly in Malaysia?</field><field name="creator">Yusof, Yusnani Mohd</field><field name="description">Malaysia&#146;s export-oriented economy has developed rapidly from one based on agriculture to one that is supported by manufacturing, high tech industry and tourism. As a result of this modernization, living standards and behavioral patterns of the population are changing. This increase in living standards has demographic implications such as a decrease in fertility levels, increase in longevity and reductions in average household size. As a consequence of these changes, a rapid increase in number of elderly (people over 60 years of age) is predicted over the next 20 years. Traditionally the elderly in Malaysia lived as an extended family with their children, mainly in the rural areas. However as urbanization is growing, the young are moving to cities, leaving the elderly in a dilemma of whether to move with their children or to stay in their traditional rural environment. This situation raises the key research question &#150; what should happen to the future housingaccommodation of the elderly in Malaysia? Considering five main UN principles, that the elderly persons should be entitled to independence, participation, care, self-fulfillment and dignity, there is an evident potential for research targeting future accommodation for elderly in Malaysia. To establish the proportions of the research question, several key operational definitions are essential. They include those of the concepts of elderly persons, individual and population aging, aging indicators, dependency, social welfare, housing, cultural values and policy responses. To assess adequately the current conditions in Malaysia and to construct a model that could become the benchmark for accommodation for the elderly, a comprehensive literature review was conducted on current conceptual models of well-being. The search uncovered five major models; The Three-Pillar Retirement Income Model, The Social Model of Welfare, The Care Model, The Williams Ring Model and the Model of Housing. In addition, key insights from other societies were forwarded in order to understand the progress made in addressing issues in ageing, income, welfare, health, housing and service. The specific concept of culturalvalues which are pervasive in the multi-ethnic Malaysian population which includes Malays, Chinese and Bidayuh are analyzed in view of the link of the cultural-values dimensions with an overall housing-accommodation system. The newly developed Culturally Modified Housing-Accommodation Model (CMHAM) can become a tool for decision-makers and policy planners to catalogue housing preferences, and subsequently identify choices in housingaccommodation and features of the social environment most suitable for the elderly population. The elderly individual and members of the family can gauge their preparedness in accommodation needs in the face of the imminent demands of old age. Considering the application of the CMHAM in Malaysia, seven general assumptions were identified covering dimensions such as cultural values, the housing accommodation system, physical planning and policy responses. The architecture and content of the model were laid out. A stimulus-response approach in the motivation and operation of the CMHAM and an adapt-modifymove approach in decision making were employed. In the final stages of this study, a survey questionnaire testing the newly developed model was carried out on a sample of elderly Malaysians in a rural setting in Tebakang and an urban setting in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia. With the rural elderly population, the cultural values are immediately challenged. The basic difference is that whereas in urban areas elderly persons are integrated into a more fluid and eclectic urban environment, in rural areas elderly persons have an intimate relation with the traditional community around them. The type of accommodation in urban areas reflects a need for diverse design options and planning. But in the rural areas, cultural values demand a high degree of visual inclusiveness; the accommodation arrangements rely on barrier-free movement and ease in flow of interaction among members of the family and the community. Strategies in accommodation of the elderly, therefore, deal with ageing as a consciously planned process from both the private and public points of view, not something haphazard and incremental. The process should retain people&#146;s core beliefs and traditional cultural values, but with sufficient flexibility to incorporate changes along the way, and to the extent that resources permit, the process should feature ownership and guidance by the elderly individual and local community. Ageing in place can be validated as a desired and general modus operandi but will need augmentation by developments on the home to institution interface. Hence, results of this project are aimed at policy makers and the elderly individual and family to ensure preparedness in accommodation needs in old age.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158676</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Nineteenth Century in the Recent Australian Imaginary</field><field name="creator">Duthie, Fiona</field><field name="description">The nineteenth century has long been a source of fascination for Australian writers and historians as the origins of white settlement are continuously disentangled. As rapid changes in technology, economic restructuring and political innovations in the last thirty years have made the questions of values and future direction more urgent, re-evaluations of the past, focused by the Bicentennial of white settlement in 1988, have played a role in this quest. This thesis will discuss the ways in which certain aspects of the nineteenth century are represented in the recent Australian imaginary and what these representations imply about contemporary Australian culture. It will become clear that in recent times, Australian historical disciplines have been enriched by a proliferation of voices and methods. However, most historical novelists and historians do not paint the voices unmediated &#150; there is a system of ethics in most interpretative frameworks. This thesis will analyse fictional representations in terms of the ethical debates informing both modern literature and historiography. There will be three subject areas: &#147;Depictions of Britain&#148;, &#147;Convictism&#148; and &#147;Relations with Aborigines.&#148; The first chapter will examine various representations of nineteenth-century Britain in recent Australian literature. This will include examinations of the relevant sections in Barbara Hanrahan&#146;s The Albatross Muff (1977), Peter Carey&#146;s Oscar and Lucinda (1988), Michael Noonan&#146;s Magwitch (1982), Peter Carey&#146;s Jack Maggs (1997), David Malouf&#146;s The Conversations at Curlow Creek (1996) and Bryce Courtenay&#146;s The Potato Factory (1995). The prison settlements of colonial Australia have been an equally popular subject over the period under discussion. Therefore, the second chapter will examine Jessica Anderson&#146;s The Commandant (1975), Come Danger, Come Darkness (1978) by Ruth Park, Rodney Hall&#146;s The Second Bridegroom (1991), Gould&#146;s Book of Fish: A Novel in Twelve Fish (2001) by Richard Flanagan, Christopher Koch&#146;s Out of Ireland (1999) and Thomas Keneally&#146;s novel The Playmaker (1987). As interjections to these accounts will be the historical arguments of Robert Hughes, Michael Roe, Stephen Nicholas, Ian Duffield and Lloyd L. Robson. In the third chapter, recent representations of social and personal relations between Aborigines and white settlers will be examined. The chapter will focus upon Patrick White&#146;s A Fringe of Leaves (1976), Liam Davison&#146;s The White Woman (1994), Grace Bartram&#146;s Darker Grows the Valley (1981), Jack Davis&#146;s Kullark (1984), Rodney Hall&#146;s The Second Bridegroom (1991), David Malouf&#146;s Remembering Babylon (1993) and Thomas Keneally&#146;s The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith (1972). Representations of violent relations will also be examined. There are copious fictional accounts of settlers slaughtering Aboriginal people. Among others, the thesis will consider Mudrooroo&#146;s Dr Wooreddy&#146;s Prescription for Enduring the Ending of the World (1983), Mark Svendsen&#146;s Poison Under Their Lips (2001), Carmel Bird&#146;s Cape Grimm (2004), Queen Trucanini by Nancy Cato and Vivienne Rae Ellis (1976), Jack Davis&#146;s Kullark (1984), Eric Willmot&#146;s Pemulwuy: The Rainbow Warrior (1987), Kate Grenville&#146;s The Secret River (2005), Robert Drewe&#146;s The Savage Crows (1976), Thea Astley&#146;s A Kindness Cup (1975) and Sam Watson&#146;s The Kadaitcha Sung (1990). Parallel to these studies will be discussions of the historical works of Henry Reynolds, Geoffrey Blainey, Bain Attwood, Keith Windschuttle and Lyndall Ryan.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158675</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mitochondrial genomics of lice (Insecta: Phthiraptera)</field><field name="creator">Covacin, Catherine</field><field name="description">Mitochondria are semiautonomous organelles found in most eukaryotic cells. Mitochondria are essential for the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and play a role in apoptosis, disease and ageing. Mitochondria have their own genomes. Information from nucleotide sequences and gene arrangements of mitochondrial genomes are useful for understanding the evolution of animals. I studied factors that may have influenced or contributed to the extraordinary mt gene arrangements in lice. These factors included the number and type of mitochondrial (mt) nucleotide substitutions, insertions and deletions that accumulate during the lifetime of a louse, damage to mt genomes of lice by a mutagen and the presence and effect of the bacteria, Wolbachia, in lice. The arrangement of genes in the mt genomes of most insects is the same, or similar, to that inferred to be ancestral for insects. However, the arrangement of genes in the mt genome of the wallaby louse, Heterodoxus macropus (Suborder, Amblycera), was extraordinarily different to that of other insects. I sequenced the mt genome of the small pigeon louse, Campanulotes bidentatus (Suborder, Ischnocera), to determine the mitochondrial gene arrangement of a louse from another suborder, the suborder Ischnocera. Sequences of part the mt genomes of eight other species of lice from the three major suborders, Anoplura, Amblycera and Ischnocera, provided an understanding of the relationship within and between these suborders of lice. To investigate mutations in somatic mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA) during the lives of human clothes (body) lice, Pediculus humanus, I compared the mtDNA from adult female lice with the mtDNA from their first egg. I studied 469 bp of the gene for cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) and 438 bp of a non-coding region of the mt genomes of these lice. A single point-mutation was found in the 469 bp of the cox1 gene whereas 66 point-mutations were found in the 438 bp of the non-coding region. To further investigate mutations in somatic mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA), I fed P. humanus the blood of rabbits that had been laced with methylene blue. Methylene blue plus light in the presence of oxygen induces singlet-oxygen (102 ). Singletoxygen damages membranes, inhibits enzyme activity and causes DNA mutations. The lice fed methylene blue differed from the lice not fed methylene blue at one of the 469 sites in the cox1 gene and at 19 of the 438 sites in a non-coding region. These results suggested that lice protected the nucleotide sequence of the cox1 gene but did not protect the nucleotide sequence of the non-coding region. Inheritance of mtDNA haplotypes, in some species of insects, has been linked to the transmission of the bacteria Wolbachia, from infected females to their offspring. I studied six species of lice from the three main suborders of lice. These lice were infected with Wolbachia from supergroups A and F. This was the first report of an infection of Wolbachia supergroup F in lice. The phylogeny of the Wolbachia spp. that infect lice, with representatives of all Wolbachia supergroups, was inferred from the nucleotide sequences from the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU rRNA). There was no evidence of congruence between the taxon of lice and the Wolbachia that infects lice. There was also no correlation between Wolbachia spp. and the mt gene arrangement found in the different suborders of lice.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158674</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE SELF EVALUATION MAINTENANCE MODEL IN ADOLESCENT SIBLING AND TWIN RELATIONSHIPS</field><field name="creator">Blakeley-Smith, Anita Maria</field><field name="description">The project was designed to examine how nontwin and twin sibling adolescents deal with situations of competition and comparison between them. Using the Self Evaluation Maintenance Model (Tesser, 1988) as a framework, this project explored the reactions and strategies that adolescent nontwin and twin adolescents employ in order to maintain a positive selfevaluation. In addition, the potential mediating factors of sibling relationship quality and perceptions of differential parental treatment on adolescents&#146; reactions to competition and comparison to their self esteem was also investigated. Three studies were conducted. All three studies investigated the relevance of the SEM model to understanding nontwin and twin adolescents&#146; reactions to situations of competition and comparison, but employed different methodologies and samples. Study 1 involved both members of the sibling pair completing a questionnaire that included their emotional and behavioural reactions to selfgenerated situations of competition and comparison, counterbalanced by closeness, relevance and performance. In this study, closeness referred to either a sibling or friend comparator. Four hundred and sixty (232 pairs of) same sex nontwin and twin adolescents aged between 13 and 17 took part in Study 1. The results revealed that both sibling nontwin and twin adolescents were motivated to maintain a positive self evaluation. In line with the SEM model, both the comparison and reflection processes were evident for emotional reactions. However, closeness of the competitor did not interact with selfrelevance of the task to affect performance as predicted. Self evaluation was enhanced when both nontwin and twin adolescents were outperformed on tasks of low rather than high self relevance, indicating the presence of the reflection process. However, nontwin adolescents reported being more positive about being outperformed by their sibling than their friend suggesting that siblings may consider their friendships to be the closer relationship to them. Closeness of the competitor did not affect positive reactions to competition and comparison for twin adolescents. For negative emotional reactions and behavioural reactions, closeness of the competitor did not interact with relevance to affect performance for either nontwin or twin adolescents as predicted. Birth order was found to affect self evaluation, even in twin relationships. Both younger nontwin and twin adolescents were more able to preserve self evaluation when outperformed by their older sibling, while older nontwin and twin adolescents found being outperformed by their younger sibling to be particularly difficult. Zygosity effects were only found for positive but not negative emotional reactions. Contrary to expectations, perceptions of differential parental treatment did not mediate emotional reactions to self esteem for adolescents. Sibling relationship quality did not mediate emotional reactions to self esteem for nontwin adolescents. When outperformed by their twin, sibling relationship conflict and sibling relationship warmth was found to mediate emotional reactions to self esteem for monozygotic twins and dizygotic twins respectively. A subsample of Study 1 participants completed Study 2. The participants in Study 2 were one hundred and six (53 pairs of) nontwin and twin same sex adolescents. Study 2 explored nontwin and twin adolescent siblings&#146; emotional reactions to situations of competition and comparison in an experiential context, again using the SEM model (Tesser, 1988) as a framework. Sibling pairs were asked to orally discuss situations where they had competed with or compared themselves to their sibling/twin, to view themselves completing this discussion and then to complete a series of questions relating to Tesser&#146;s (1988) SEM model. Subjects completed the same questions for each of the four SEM conditions, counterbalanced by performance on the task and relevance of the task. As adolescents only competed against a close competitor (i.e. their sibling), the relevance of the task was the determining factor as to whether the processes of reflection and comparison would be utilised. The comparison and reflection processes were indicated for both positive and negative emotional reactions for nontwin and twin adolescents. Unlike Study 1, birth order, zygosity effects and mediating effects of sibling relationship quality were not found. Study 3 involved comparison of nontwin and twin adolescents in terms of self evaluation maintenance within the framework of the SEM model in both the retrospective and experiential context. In this study, closeness was assessed in terms of genetic similarity. Monozygotic twins showed the most positive emotional reactions to performance against their twin than dizygotic twins and siblings in both contexts. For retrospectively recalled situations, siblings, rather than twins, reported the most negative reactions to being outperformed on highly self relevant tasks compared to monozygotic and dizygotic twins. This project found that the SEM model (Tesser, 1988) provided a more valid framework for explaining both twin and nontwin adolescent siblings self evaluation maintenance than a strictly social comparison approach. The results of all three studies were interpreted as being generally consistent with the SEM model. The results contribute new insights into differences in self evaluation maintenance between nontwin and twin adolescent siblings and provide direction for future research into the potential role of birth order, sibling relationship quality and attachment in adolescents&#146; self evaluation maintenance.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158673</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ON-LINE HELP: An Aid to Effective Use of Software</field><field name="creator">Foster, Geoffrey Alan</field><field name="description">Abstract The main thrust of this study is to investigate how users of mass-market word-processing software go about using the built-in help systems provided in application packages as they work: how frequently they seek help with the functions they need, how they approach and access this help, how they perceive it, and in what ways their performance on tasks is improved as a result. The study concludes by suggesting how users&#146; confidence, effectiveness and approach to using on-line help systems might be improved, as well as recommending further investigations. The help facilities provided in computer software can take on varying forms: hints, help and coaching. To begin, I take hints to be small pieces of advice offered generally, at no particular time, but possibly ahead of the performance of the activity to which they relate. So the kind of information counted as hints would include what Word refers to as &#145;tool tips&#146;&#151;short messages that appear when the mouse pointer rests on a visible item, such as a button or an item on a window; as well as the &#145;tip of the day&#146; which is displayed when the program starts up. As well as these explicit hints, there are also implicit ones, such as those embodied in the names of menu items (if any one doubts their effect, let them try using a version of a program intended for speakers of a different language, where the menu names and the names of menu items can be of very little help. For example, under the French &#145;Fichier&#146; menu, there might be the following items: Nouveau, Ouvrir&#133;, Ouvrir l&#146;&#233;l&#233;ment recent, Fermer, Enregistrer. Enregistrer sous, Tout enregister, Format d&#146;impression, Imprimer&#133; ). Even more abstractly, it could be claimed that the whole &#145;look and feel&#146; of a program continually prompts the user with hints. Help is the general focus of the bulk of this thesis, taking in any feature that is meant to respond to a user&#146;s request for assistance. I need discuss this here no further as it will be comprehensively covered later. Finally, coaching can be defined as any activity that is intended to improve performance or to correct errors or bad habits. In contrast to help, it is often prompted by the user&#146;s behaviour (&#147;It looks like you&#146;re writing a letter. &#133;&#148;), or by the error itself. The coloured underlining done by the spelling and grammar checkers could also be called coaching. And the most obvious coaching lessons are those provided by the various &#145;wizards&#146; that can be invoked via menu items to guide the user through complex procedures, such as executing a mail merge. The literature that was surveyed ranges over a number of areas of relevance, several of which were explored in some detail, such as: references to help systems specifically, the way that beginners typically fail to progress beyond a modest level of proficiency, the human&#150;computer interface (HCI), the efficacy of help systems and the factors influencing how users approach and value them, the categories of complaints frequently made about help, computer-mediated learning, the heuristics of usability testing and what evaluative approaches are possible. The literature provided valuable background for formulating and implementing an experimental program and in evaluating and analyzing its outcomes. In particular, it was realized at an early stage that several techniques commonly employed in usability testing were beyond the financial and staffing resources available; for example video recording of users&#146; interactions with software, or monitoring of these interactions by expert, trained observers and evaluators. An alternative approach was developed, which drew on the resources of the student subjects, who worked in pairs so that one member of the pair tackled the set tasks while the other observed and took records on pro-formas devised for this study. This approach, using pairs (or &#145;dyads&#146;) turned out to be successful. Since an action-research paradigm was adopted, in which a process of evaluation and modification was applied to each successive experiment, it was possible to progressively refine the approach with respect to both the exercises given to the participants and the procedures and pro-formas used to monitor and record the results. An article on the approach was written for the British Journal of Educational Technology, and this is included as an appendix to this thesis. The experimental subjects (those who contributed to surveys, plus a total of 176 who participated in the initial focus groups and the task-based experiments) were recruited from the students, mainly in first year, of the School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering at the University of Queensland. The assumption was made that this sample would not differ substantially from the general population of those who use word processors for a variety of purposes but who are not professional clerical workers. The word processor with which almost all of them were already familiar was Microsoft Word, and this was adopted as the vehicle for the experimental program After an initial phase in which students&#146; attitudes and practices were explored to provide a context, using focus groups and an on-line survey, a series of experiments was designed and conducted, using an action research paradigm to refine the techniques and materials used as the program proceeded. A set of tasks was devised for each experiment, ranging from the commonplace (such as changing font and text size) through the more demanding (such as manipulating tables) to the less routine (such as insertion of graphics in the text and as background). The tasks were selected so that they would require most students to seek help at some point, while not being exceptionally challenging. Interesting and potentially valuable results have come out of these experiments: many of the students had been using the software for a number of years, starting at school, and were currently word-processing for several hours a week, but surprisingly they were typically using just a minimal sub-set of the capabilities of the software, given that they could satisfy most of their writing needs with them. There appeared to be a common tendency to avoid seeking help, since when the set tasks called for more advanced techniques a substantial proportion of users preferred to browse the menus, or use trial-and-error, rather than take full advantage of the help system. However these students, when forced into it by the terms of the experiments, were generally able to find and use the help that they needed to perform well in the more demanding tasks. This study suggests that many users are coping reasonably well with their day-to-day word processing but might save time and effort in the longer term (and produce more rewarding outcomes) if they could only take advantage of additional features of the software. One factor hindering them is their reluctance to use help, whether this arises from unfamiliarity, lack of confidence, unfortunate earlier experiences, sheer prejudice, or simple inertia. As well as the potential improvements in users&#146; facility with the packages that might be brought about by training, which was once general but has recently been largely discarded, there are ways of making help more acceptable and thus more immediately usable for these people: help systems could be made more palatable and at the same time more educative, without being patronizing or paternalistic, and this depends in part on achieving a closer alignment between the mental models of the software held by various disparate groups of users and those used by its designers. In summary, and on careful inspection, Microsoft Word is revealed as a comprehensively accomplished application that can appear daunting at first. It is a pity that, according to this study, there are many users who never progress beyond the unambitious use of a modest set of its capabilities. This thesis concludes by suggesting that barriers to the full exploitation of the powers of Word and similar software packages may be overcome by a few simple strategies, including simplifying the already plentiful repertoire of customisation tools and devising training aimed specifically at enriching and smoothing the beginners&#146; learning curve.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">on-line help</field><field name="subject">word-processing</field><field name="subject">consumer software</field><field name="subject">usability</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158049</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Physiology Of Microorganisms In Enhanced Biological Phosphorous Removal</field><field name="creator">Saunders, Aaron Marc</field><field name="description">Enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) is a biological wastewater treatment process facilitated by polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAO). The absence of isolates that have the PAO phenotype has limited the scope of studies into the physiology of these industrially significant and metabolically unique organisms. This thesis outlines findings into the physiology and ecology of EBPR in mixed microbial cultures, which contribute to the fundamental understanding of the process. The first experimental approach used in these studies was to investigate the microbial abundance of identified PAOs and GAOs in full-scale and lab-scale EBPR processes, and correlate these data with chemical monitoring methods both at a &#147;macroscale&#148; and &#147;microscale&#148;. The &#147;macroscale&#148; studies consisted of process optimisation experiments that found propionate to be a more effective and stable carbon source than acetate. The &#147;microscale&#148; study investigated the activity of Competibacter, growing in dense aggregates. This study discovered that the structure of the granules affected the distribution of activity by limiting the supply of oxygen and that the activity of the Competibacter in turn affected the structure of the aggregate. The second experimental approach was to target key facets of the microbial physiology of PAOs and GAOs at a molecular level. Environmental gene expression studies were used to investigate the stimulus for the expression of a putative Accumulibacter polyphosphate kinase gene (ppk). This study found that the expression of this gene was repressed by high external phosphate concentrations, which suggests that the pho regulon is functioning in Accumulibacter. In another study, previously published models were integrated and elaborated to develop a model for the membrane transport processes in PAOs and GAOs, which give them the unique ability to sequester VFA without an electron acceptor. These studies confirmed that the proton-motive force (PMF) drives the uptake of VFA by both PAOs and GAOs and postulated fundamental differences in the molecular mechanisms that PAOs and GAOs use to create a PMF in the absence of respiratory electron transport. The studies also explain the molecular basis for findings in other studies that PAOs have a competitive advantage over GAOs at increased pH. The third experimental approach was to attempt to isolate organisms significant to EBPR. Some measure of success was achieved: colonies of Competibacter were obtained in pure culture but the growth could not be sustained further than the growth of micro-colonies just visible to the eye. EBPR microbiology, like many other subjects of inquiry in environmental microbiology, has benefited greatly from developments in molecular methods to identify and describe microbial communities. However, the investigation of microbial physiology in the environment remains a challenge; this thesis has taken up that challenge. Discoveries regarding the benefits of propionate as a carbon source and the basis for the competitive advantage that PAOs derive from an increased pH have potential application for practitioners of EBPR plants. Furthermore the findings make a contribution to the fundamental understanding of the physiology of EBPR organisms that may in the future lead to entirely novel approaches to EBPR optimisation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wastewater treatment</field><field name="subject">phosphorus removal</field><field name="subject">environmental microbiology</field><field name="subject">microbial ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Idealised and Demonised: The Construction of Motherhood in the IVF Policy Debate in Australia</field><field name="creator">Smith, Jennifer Lynne</field><field name="description">Over the past five years an often emotive and controversial public debate has emerged in Australia over access to reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilisation and donor insemination. The debate was in part prompted by a policy announcement made by the Federal Government who aimed to effectively bar single and lesbian women from accessing these technologies on the basis of marital status. The resulting public debate has centred around questions concerning which &#145;types&#146; of women should be allowed to access reproductive technologies and therefore reproduce. The debate was a highly salient one and the issues have been widely discussed amongst the public, within parliament and through the media, thereby creating a forum where ideas of just what constitutes &#145;valid&#146; motherhood are publicly and privately contested. The purpose of this thesis is to examine the discursive construction of categories of motherhood identity, using the public policy debate around access to reproductive technologies in Australia as a research site. I specifically investigate the designation of particular identities of motherhood as &#145;good&#146; and therefore acceptable, and others as deviant and therefore undeserving of access to the full range of social services available. The research is situated within the field of critical social policy and utilises theories of governmentality, feminism, sexuality and motherhood. The use of theories of governmentality, as developed by Michel Foucault [1979] and implemented by Mitchell Dean (1999), is primary within the research because they enable a consideration of the techniques and discourses through which the identity of the mother is governed and through which individual women act upon and construct their own identities. The analysis engendered by the use of governmentality is educated by an understanding of the socially constituted and inscribed body highlighted within feminist and postmodern approaches. The use of a critical social policy approach situates the research within an epistemological paradigm which offers an analysis that is able to conceptualise the operations of power and the marginalisation and manipulation of particular identities. Theories of sexuality and motherhood are utilised in order to critique these central aspects of women&#146;s experiences which have been largely disregarded in much &#145;traditional&#146; social policy analysis. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/uqlclayt/Desktop/01front.txt (4 of 17)23/03/2006 1:16:06 PM file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/uqlclayt/Desktop/01front.txt The methodology employed in this research is influenced by an understanding of the functioning of discourse as a device through which social processes and identities are questioned and transformed. I therefore utilise discourse analysis in order to investigate the construction of motherhood identities within the debate around access to reproductive technologies. The specific methodology that I use is critical discourse analysis as developed by Norman Fairclough (1992, 1995, 2003) and Ruth Wodak (2001). In order to investigate the construction of motherhood identities within the study site I conduct a critical discourse analysis of the media texts from two major newspapers which relate to the debate. I also analyse the parliamentary debate which considered the introduction of legislation aimed at allowing individual Australian State governments to restrict access to reproductive technologies. I compare and contrast this analysis with an examination of the mother identities expressed in the narratives of individual single and lesbian women who engage with the reproductive technologies discussed in the debate. In essence this thesis identifies, in the public policy debate around reproductive technologies, a moment of problematisation where the practices of governing involved in the production of motherhood identities are made apparent. I use an analysis of this moment in order to identify and question the construction of motherhood which takes place within policy debates and how individual women construct their own identities as mothers both in relation to and separate from this. The newspaper and parliamentary texts are found to govern women&#146;s behaviour through the identification and promulgation of narrow &#145;good&#146; mother and &#145;good&#146; citizen identities which constrain the range of mother identities deemed to be acceptable. The women&#146;s narratives are found to reject the negative characterisation of their identities within popular discourses and construct a mothering persona for themselves which paradoxically also serves to highlight and enforce many of the characteristics of the idealised &#145;good&#146; mother identity.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Governmentality</field><field name="subject">IVF</field><field name="subject">reproductive technologies</field><field name="subject">policy</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">lesbians</field><field name="subject">single women</field><field name="subject">critical discourse analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158048</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of mental time travel</field><field name="creator">Busby, Janie Amber</field><field name="description">Adults can mentally relive experiences from their past and anticipate possible future events, a process called mental time travel (MTT). Recently, several theorists have argued that the ability to mentally travel through time may not emerge until 3- to 5-years of age. This proposal is based on evidence from a wide range of research, including investigations into children&#146;s recall, planning and differentiation of the times of events in the past and the future. However, as yet there has been no dedicated effort to find out how and when MTT develops. The current series of studies brought together a wide range of resources with the aim of designing a series of novel paradigms to measure aspects of MTT development between 3- and 5-years of age. The first of these novel approaches asked children to report events that occurred to them &#147;yesterday&#148; and would occur to them &#147;tomorrow&#148;, revealing that by 4- to 5-years of age most children could accurately do so. Another series of studies examined children&#146;s ability to anticipate a different, future situation, finding that only by 4- to 5-years did children&#146;s behaviour reflect differences in an anticipated future environment. Subsequent studies focusing on children&#146;s discrimination of past and future also suggested that by 4- to 5-years children could distinguish the different causal impact of past and future events on the present. Another task revealed that during the preschool years children become better at differentiating the times of events from throughout their own lifespan. These new data provide support for the claim that the ability to mentally travel into one&#146;s own past and future emerges during the preschool years. This thesis describes the first directed investigation into the development of MTT as a whole, bringing together much of the empirical and theoretical literature for the first time. The tasks designed are new approaches to investigating MTT and represent a starting point for future research. This thesis also introduces and discusses theories for the development of MTT, aiming to stimulate discussion not just of when it emerges, but how, and what processes may underlie the transition.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">389900 Other Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="subject">780108 Behavioural and cognitive sciences</field><field name="subject">mental time travel</field><field name="subject">cognitive development</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">episodic memory</field><field name="subject">episodic future thinking</field><field name="subject">time</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158045</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parenting and family support in primary care setting</field><field name="creator">Turner, Karen Mary Thomas</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a program of research evaluating the implementation of a primary care intervention program for disruptive child behaviour, and the process of dissemination of the intervention to primary care staff. The specific aims were to: 1) evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability of a brief, preventive behavioural family intervention (BFI) administered by primary care staff in improving parenting skills and confidence and reducing targeted child behaviour problems; 2) assess the process of disseminating the intervention to primary care professionals by evaluating aids and obstacles for program implementation in the workplace; and 3) provide recommendations for future dissemination of psychological interventions. Childhood disruptive behaviour problems are becoming increasingly prevalent and are associated with significant personal and societal costs. Much is now known about the development of such problems, including individual, family and social risk and protective factors. There is considerable evidence that BFI programs are effective in reducing child behaviour problems and the family risk factors associated with the development and maintenance of these problems. Unfortunately, many evaluated programs have not been disseminated effectively, and have primarily been provided to clinical or high-risk populations in efficacy trials. Primary care settings have been increasingly identified as ideal settings for detection and early intervention for child mental health problems. However, there is limited research in the area of primary care BFI. While dissemination of psychological innovation to psychologists has historically been poor, with little impact on the professional practices of practitioners in the field, documentation of dissemination of these interventions to non-psychologists is rare. Although dissemination and diffusion theory have expanded, there is little controlled research evaluating the necessary or optimal conditions for the adoption and ongoing implementation of evidence-based programs. To address the problem of poor dissemination and limited access to evidence-based parenting programs in the community, a multilevel parenting and family support initiative, the Triple P-Positive Parenting Program, has been developed at the University of Queensland. One level of this system, Primary Care Triple P, encompasses a preventively oriented, early intervention program that aims to promote positive, caring relationships between parents and their children and to help parents develop effective management strategies for a variety of common behavioural and developmental issues. This primary care intervention was trialled and disseminated in the current research. Study 1 examined the effectiveness of Primary Care Triple P implemented by child health nurses with clients requesting help for child behaviour problems. A randomised group methodology was employed, comparing the intervention with a waitlist control condition. Assessments were completed at pre, post and 6-month follow-up. Data are presented for 26 families. In comparison to the waitlist condition, families receiving the intervention showed a significant reduction in targeted child behaviour problem/s according to monitoring and mother-report. Mothers receiving the intervention also reported significantly reduced dysfunctional parenting practices, greater satisfaction with their parenting role, and decreased anxiety and stress following the intervention in comparison to waitlist mothers. No group differences were found for observed parent-child interaction. However, rates of observed disruptive child behaviour and aversive parent behaviour were low from the outset. Consumer satisfaction with the program was high, and intervention gains were primarily maintained at 6-month follow-up. These results provide some of the first effectiveness outcomes from a randomised controlled trial of BFI in a primary care setting, and establish the effectiveness and acceptability of Primary Care Triple P conducted by child health nurses as part of usual practice. Study 2 examined the implementation of Primary Care Triple P following professional training in the program. Results of a survey of 1078 professionals are presented. A model of the personal, program, training and workplace factors influencing program implementation was tested. Structured equation modelling confirmed that practitioner self-efficacy mediated the relationship between program characteristics and program implementation. Prior professional experience and satisfaction with training did not predict self-efficacy or uptake. Workplace support was also directly associated with program implementation. These results advance our knowledge of the aids and obstacles faced by practitioners in implementing a new program in the workplace. This research provides important new knowledge in relation to improving early access to empirically-supported intervention services and has implications for the potential scope of service delivery in primary care settings. It also advances our understanding of the factors influencing a professional&#146;s ability to implement a new intervention program following training. This information may inform the development of future dissemination efforts, allowing them to address necessary program, personal and workplace supports, and optimise program implementation following training.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380107 Health, Clinical and Counselling Psychology</field><field name="subject">730204 Child health</field><field name="subject">child behaviour problems</field><field name="subject">parenting</field><field name="subject">behavioural family intervention</field><field name="subject">primary care</field><field name="subject">dissemination</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158046</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High culture as subculture: Brisbane's contemporary chamber music scene</field><field name="creator">Burgess, Jean</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1904 Performing Arts and Creative Writing</field><field name="subject">160403 Social and Cultural Geography</field><field name="subject">950101 Music</field><field name="subject">Subculture -- Queensland -- Brisbane -- Case studies.</field><field name="subject">Chamber music -- Queensland -- Brisbane.</field><field name="subject">Brisbane</field><field name="subject">cultural studies</field><field name="subject">classical music</field><field name="subject">arts audiences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158044</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Network Security for Embedded Systems</field><field name="creator">Lessner, Dirk</field><field name="description">It is widely recognised that security is a concern in the design of a wide range of embedded systems. However, security for embedded systems remains an unsolved problem, which could create greater challenges in the future than security for mainstream computers today. The promise of universal connectivity for embedded systems creates increased possibilities for malicious users to gain unauthorised access to sensitive information. All modern security protocols use private-key and public-key algorithms. This thesis investigates three important cryptography algorithms (RC4, AES, and RSA) and their relevance to networked embedded systems. Limitations in processing power, battery life, communication bandwidth, memory and costs constrain the applicability of existing cryptography standards for small embedded devices. A mismatch between wide arithmetic for security (32 bit word operations) and embedded data bus widths (often only 8 or 16 bits) combined with a lack of certain operations (e. g., multi precision arithmetic) highlight a gap in the domain of networked embedded systems security. The aim of this thesis is to find feasible security solutions for networked embedded system applications. The above mentioned cryptography algorithms have been ported to three hardware platforms (Rabbit RCM3000, Xilinx Virtex 4 FPGA with MicroBlaze softcore, and a Linux desktop machine) in order to simulate several real world scenarios. Three applications &#150; bidirectional transmission with encryption and decryption for various payload length, unidirectional transmission with very short payload, and encrypted data streaming &#150; were developed to meet the simulation requirements. Several timing results were collected and used for calculating the achieved throughput. The Rabbit hardware platform, which represents the lower end in this thesis, was able to perform the RC4 crypto algorithm with a throughput of about 155 kbit/s. Thus the RC4 crypto algorithm was proven to outperform the AES crypto algorithm by a factor of 5, with AES achieving a throughput of about 32 kbit/s with the same hardware platform. The throughput was similar with the streaming application and UDP data transport. Without performing a cryto algorithm, the streaming application was able to process up to 1.5 Mbit/s. RSA was not implemented on the Rabbit hardware platform. The MicroBlaze hardware platform outperformed the Rabbit system by a factor of 5 &#150; 10. It reached a throughput up to 1.5 Mbit/s with RC4 and up to 130 kbit/s with AES. The RSA algorithm reached up to 0.8 kbit/s on this hardware platform, showing that public-key ciphers are only suitable for short payload data, such as the exchange of a session key. The Linux machine was included in this test only to provide a reference to a non embedded system. The Linux performance was better than the MicroBlaze system by a factor of between 67 &#150; 770, and better than the Rabbit platform by a factor of between 645 &#150; 3125. Both the RC4 and the AES crypto algorithm reached a throughput of up to 100 Mbit/s on the Linux machine, with a throughput of up to 130 kbit/s reached with RSA. Hence, the Rabbit platform combined with the RC4 algorithm is suitable, for example, for MP3 streams with up to 150 kbit/s. The Rabbit platform with the AES algorithm could be used for low quality audio streams, for example for speech announcements. If a higher throughput is required, for example for video streams, the MicroBlaze could be an appropriate platform with throughput of up to 1.5 Mbit/s. Low cost embedded systems like Atmel AVR are not suitable for processing cipher algorithms developed in C. It is widely recommended that assembly language is used to develop such platforms.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Embedded Systems</field><field name="subject">Rabbit</field><field name="subject">MicroBlaze</field><field name="subject">Xilinx</field><field name="subject">FPGA</field><field name="subject">Cryptography</field><field name="subject">Cipher Algorithm</field><field name="subject">AES</field><field name="subject">RSA</field><field name="subject">RC4</field><field name="subject">Linux</field><field name="subject">C</field><field name="subject">C#</field><field name="subject">Assembly Language</field><field name="subject">.NET</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158042</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating re-purchase intention in an experiential context using operations and marketing perspectives</field><field name="creator">Hume, Margee</field><field name="description">Abstract The purpose of this thesis is to undertake theory development and testing particular to re-purchase intention in an experiential service context, specifically the cultural performing arts. Services researchers suggest implementing a multi-disciplinary approach to research that uses theories and methods from several of the management fields will advance the domain of services research. This thesis aims to contribute to the field of service research by drawing from methods and theories offered in both service operations and services marketing fields. To date, service research has been preoccupied primarily with consumer behaviour aspects of services marketing such as satisfaction but underestimates the importance of constructs such as re-purchase intention and the subsequent implications for strategy formulation and implementation. Further to this, the current approach to services research has overlooked the nexus between marketing and operations and the importance of the implementation of strategy to achieve objectives. It is argued that failing to integrate service operations both practically and theoretically into the re-purchase intentions research framework confines its potential effectiveness. In addition, the lack of specific service context application has been identified as a significant oversight in previous services research. Construct measurements and findings have been difficult to replicate across contexts and contextual examination of constructs and relationships has been suggested as a solution. One such context deserving of attention is that of the experiential services, specifically the performing arts. Therefore, using measures and theories developed specifically for this context, this thesis will offer a more comprehensive approach to re-purchase intention research in a performing arts setting. This thesis adopts a mixed method approach by implementing a series of three integrated studies, which amalgamates both operations and marketing fields. This thesis aims to identify the aspects of a performing arts encounter that are relevant to the customer by conducting a two-staged set of qualitative interviews. This process is based on the operations technique Service Transaction Analysis (STA). First, consultant consumers and organisational personnel were used to formulate a consensus definition of a typical performing arts experience and, second, 26 in-depth interviews were conducted with potential future consumers of the performing arts based on this description of the offering. These two studies, coupled with extant literature, informed the research instrument designed for the main survey. This instrument was conducted on 273 potential future consumers of the performing arts. Qualitative work undertaken in Study 1 identifies the service experience description. Study 2 highlights the service management and marketing issues relating to re-purchase intention especially focusing on value, customer satisfaction, show experience and service quality and discloses a set of specific issues incorporated into the wording of the survey instrument. Study 3 measures and tests the key constructs of service quality, show experience, value, satisfaction and the significance of the hypothesised pathways to re-purchase intention. The proposed model is then analysed using the AMOS 5.0 Structural Equation Modelling package. This thesis is structured in the journal paper format with each of the chapters representing each of the five journal papers. In addition, an introductory and concluding chapter are appended with the concluding chapter providing an in-depth discussion of the contributions of this thesis. The papers are based on the progressive results of the research program and offer an integrated set of findings and discussions. The papers are not mutually exclusive but interrelated to comprehensively illuminate the central research theme of the thesis and discuss many aspects of marketing and operations significant to re-purchase intention. The entire thesis is drawn from the data set generated from the three integrated studies developed to address the overall research theme. The central research theme is to investigate the nature of re-purchase intention in an experiential setting using marketing and operations theories as platforms of analysis. Interestingly, the tested model of this thesis found empirically that the subjective and experiential aspects of the service, such as the emotional and artistic quality of the show, did not have a significant and direct relationship with re-purchase intention. This finding is of interest, in particular, to scholars of experiential consumption and marketing practitioners offering these types of services. Previous research has supported the desire to fulfil experiential needs as driving the initial purchase. Conversely, this finding suggests that the desire to visit again is driven by utility and value. As customer maintenance and repeat patronage are of utmost importance to practice, this is an exciting development. Offering further support, the tested model found service quality and show experience were mediated by value to satisfaction, with satisfaction inturn mediating the relationship between value and re-purchase intention. Collectively, these findings have lead to several developments and contributions for both scholarship and practice. The contributions to knowledge of this thesis highlight five main theoretical contributions and four main managerial implications. These encompass: &#183; Advancing the &#145;service management trinity&#146;, specifically strengthening the importance of the relationship between service marketing and service operations. &#183; Advancing service management theory by understanding the service offering more intricately and the importance of service description. &#183; Clarifying the roles of experiential and utilitarian attributes of the service experience in an experiential setting extending knowledge related to re-purchase intention. &#183; Particularizing and measuring the construct of re-purchase intention to the performing arts and clarifying the predictors of this construct in the context of experiential performing arts. . &#183; Testing and clarifying the relationships of value and satisfaction to re-purchase intention extending the understanding of re-purchase intention in this field and elaborating the approach and understanding of this construct for future research. This thesis further contributes to knowledge by offering several managerial contributions. These incorporate: &#183; Market segmentation and targeting strategies as critical for performing arts management. &#183; Operations service design and creation strategies in the performing arts by including important aspects of the service experience as highlighted by customer driven research. &#183; Specific recommendation for streamlining delivery through standardised mass customisation. &#183; Offering value frameworks for creating value in service delivery and targeting customer perceptions of superior value. This extending the understanding of the customer perceived value equation. By contributing to the field of service management and advancing enquiry in the field of services marketing and service operations, this thesis offers a new perspective and practical approach to service marketing context analysis making a valuable contribution to scholarship. This approach is based on improving organisational performance in experiential services specifically by applying operations and marketing theory from a customer-perspective. By doing this, findings inform organisations of ways to better meet the needs and wants of consumers through design, delivery and marketing. Moreover, the findings assist researchers in further advancing the field of services research. This research positions the future research program to focus on continuing the advancement of service management by examining the higher order constructs of service quality and show experience and examining the impact of additional customer motivations such as emotional goal attainment and involvement in experiential settings.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">720401 Marketing</field><field name="subject">350204 Marketing and Market Research</field><field name="subject">services marketing</field><field name="subject">services operations</field><field name="subject">performing arts</field><field name="subject">service quality</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158043</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Cytochrome P450 2A5:Induction by Cadmium and its Role as Hepatic Bilirubin Oxidase</field><field name="creator">Abu Bakar, A'edah</field><field name="description">Cadmium (Cd), is a non-essential metal with no known physiological function. It is known to alter redox state by disrupting the mitochondrial electron transport chain, as well as inactivating protein and non-protein thiols. It is thus believed that oxidative stress may comprise an important part of the mechanism of Cd toxicity. Accordingly, the initial cellular response to acute Cd exposure is defensive, where various anti-oxidant defence systems are triggered. One of the induced systems is the haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Its activation is mediated by the transcription factor Nrf2, which is the general regulator of cellular defence against oxidative stress. The protective effects of HO-1 are mediated, in part, through the generation of potent anti-oxidant bilirubin (BR) and its metabolites, which exploit the intrinsic antioxidant properties of these species at a cellular level. The oxidative metabolism of BR is an important route of detoxification in addition to glucuronidation. However, the major enzyme(s) involved in this oxidative degradation are not known. This thesis presents evidence for a major role of the hepatic cytochrome P450 2a5 (Cyp2a5) in BR degradation during Cd intoxication, where the BR levels are elevated following induction of HO-1. Treatment of DBA/2J male mice with CdCl2 induced both the Cyp2a5 and HO-1, and increased the microsomal BR degradation activity. By way of contrast, the total cytochrome P450 (CYP) content and the expression of Cyp1a2 were down-regulated by the treatment. The induction of the HO-1 and Cyp2a5 was significant at the mRNA, protein and enzyme activity levels. In each case, the up-regulation of the HO-1 preceded that of the Cyp2a5 with a 5-10 hr interval. In addition, BR totally inhibited the microsomal coumarin hydroxylase activity (a Cyp2a5-catalysed reaction) with an IC50 approximately equal to the substrate concentration. The MROD activity, catalysed mainly by the Cyp1a2, was inhibited up to 36% by BR. The microsomal BR degradation was inhibited by coumarin and by a monoclonal antibody against the Cyp2a5 by about 90%. In addition, 7-methoxyresorufin, a substrate for Cyp1a2, inhibited BR degradation activity by approximately 20%. A study using Nrf2 null mutant mice suggests that Cd-mediated induction of Cyp2a5 is dependent on the transcription factor Nrf2. Additionally, acute exposure to Cd activated localisation of Nrf2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) analysis suggests that Cd induced sequence-specific binding of various species of the StRE-binding proteins on the 5&#146;-flanking region of the Cyp2a5 gene. Collectively, these observations strongly suggest that BR may act as a substrate for the hepatic Cyp2a5, a major catalyst for BR degradation under conditions of substantial elevation of BR levels following induction of HO-1 by Cd. Secondly, the concurrent up-regulation of the HO-1 and Cyp2a5 during Cd-mediated injury implicates a coordinated regulation of two enzyme systems in the maintenance of balancing BR production and elimination. Finally, StRE-binding proteins, in particular Nrf2, may be involved in the regulation of the Cyp2a5 gene, which leads to the oxidation of BR. However, the respective roles of these factors in the regulation of the Cyp2a5 gene, as well as the coordinated regulation of ho-1 and Cyp2a5 genes remain an open question, requiring further investigations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cytochrome P450</field><field name="subject">cytochrome P450 2A5</field><field name="subject">haem oxygenase</field><field name="subject">bilirubin</field><field name="subject">oxidative stress</field><field name="subject">cadmium</field><field name="subject">adaptive response to cellular stress</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158041</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Economics of Developing a Long-Distance Walking Track in North Queensland</field><field name="creator">Cook, Averil</field><field name="description">Walking tracks with provision for overnight stays exist in many countries. They are a tourism drawcard and some (e.g. the Milford Track in New Zealand) have icon status. In Australia, long-distance tracks exist in most states but had not until recently been developed in north Queensland. The working hypothesis for this thesis is that a new long-distance walking track in the tropical rainforest environment could be a valuable recreation asset for the region, and a major tourism attractor. Since a long-distance walking track in a natural environment would be situated in a rural region away from major cities, there is potential for tourism expenditure by long-distance hikers to contribute positively to the economy of remote towns. It is proposed that a walking track can be created relatively easily in the rainforests if disused former logging roads are used as the basis. The new walking track on a logging road base could be developed at moderate cost, and with minimal ecological and environmental disturbance. A new track created within a protected natural area is usually regarded as a public good and most associated costs may be considered to be appropriately funded through the taxation system. However, it may be argued that the recreational use of a long-distance walking track provides benefits to those who use it, and that hikers should contribute towards the recovery of managerial costs. An appropriate level of user fee may be obtained from a market model. In this thesis, an annual market model is estimated for the recreation service which provides a short-term efficient price. A long-distance walking track is an investment in recreation infrastructure the benefits of which are intergenerational. Thus efficiency in the long-term is also an important consideration. Both a static analysis and cost-benefit dynamic analysis are presented in this thesis. When a track does not exist (as was the case in north Queensland when this thesis commenced) or when it is under construction (as when the thesis was nearing completion), direct evaluation is not possible and so demand (consumer surplus) and supply (marginal cost of recreation service) estimates for a new track must be obtained from other sources. A key original contribution in this thesis is the application of economic transfer to derive a market model for a proposed recreation service infrastructure item, and a further application of economic transfer involves the use of the benefit level from the market model as an input into the cost-benefit analysis. Demand estimates have been obtained from surveys of visitors on two other walking tracks in north Queensland. Zonal travel cost methodology has been applied to the survey data to develop demand curves for these long-distance hiking opportunities and measures of value in terms of consumer surplus. Zonal rather than individual travel cost was necessary since most respondents were walking the particular track for the first time. Since the Centenary of Federation in Australia in 2001, when seed funding was made available, some new long-distance walking tracks have been developed in the Queensland Wet Tropics World Heritage Area. One of these has been selected as the case study developing track for this thesis. Demand and cost estimates for the new trail have been transferred, with appropriate adjustments, from the studies conducted on the two other trails. An interesting feature in this transfer process is that close substitutes exist for the target walking track but not for either of the two source walking tracks. An innovation in this thesis is the development of a market model for the new track. Two market models are derived, one from each of the source tracks, and are used to determine the socially efficient price and visitation levels. These may be used by management as a basis for the setting of user fees. The equilibrium values obtained from the static analysis have also been incorporated into the dynamic analysis together with the consumer surplus estimates from the travel cost demand curve. The equilibrium quantities provide the basis for an estimate of the visitation level expected for the new track on which many of the continuing management costs depend. Two scenarios (with and without hut infrastructure) have been investigated in cost-benefit analyses. Both scenarios were found to be economically worthwhile.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Travel cost</field><field name="subject">benefit transfer</field><field name="subject">cost benefit</field><field name="subject">market model</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158039</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simultaneous Lift, Moment and Thrust Measurements on a Scramjet in Hypervelocity Flow</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Matthew</field><field name="description">This study investigates the stress wave force balance technique for the measurement of forces on a fuelled hypersonic flight vehicle in an impulse-type test facility. A three component force balance for the measurement of lift, thrust and pitching moment on a supersonic combustion ramjet engine was designed, built, calibrated and tested. The force balance was designed using finite element analysis and consisted of four stress bars instrumented for the measurement of strain. Relative errors of less than 2% were obtained for the recovered simulated calibration loads, while errors of less than 3% were obtained for lift and thrust components for simulated fuel-on and fuel-off force loading distributions. Tests in a calibration rig showed that the balance was capable of recovering the magnitude of point loads to within 3% and their lines of action to within 1% of the chord of the model. Additional errors result when testing in a wind tunnel. The uncertainties for the experiments with fuel injection are estimated at 9%, 7% and 9% for the coefficients of lift, thrust and pitching moment. The scramjet vehicle was 0.566m long and weighed approximately 6kg. It consisted of an inlet, combustion chamber and thrust surface. Fuel could be injected through a series of injectors located on the scramjet inlet. The scramjet model was set at zero angle of attack. Experiments were performed in the T4 Free Piston Shock Tunnel at a total enthalpy of 3.3MJ/kg, a nozzle supply pressure of 32MPa and a Mach number of 6.6, with equivalence ratios up to 1.4. Fuel-off force coefficients were measured to within 2% of theoretical values based on predictions using CFD and hypersonic theory. The fuel-off centre-of-pressure was measured to within 4% of the predicted value. The force coefficients varied linearly with equivalence ratio. Good comparison of the measured lift and thrust forces with theoretical values was obtained with increasing flow rates of fuel. The lift-to-drag ratio increased from 3.0 at the fuel-off condition to 17.2 at an equivalence ratio of 1.0. Poor agreement between the measured pitching moment and theoretical values was obtained due to difficulties in predicting the pressure distribution with heat addition on the latter parts of the thrust surface. A shift in the centre-of-pressure of approximately 10% of model chord was measured as the equivalence ratio varied from 0.0 to 1.0. For the design tested, the thrust produced was not enough to overcome drag on the vehicle, even at the highest equivalence ratio tested. Tests at higher stagnation enthalpies (up to 4.9MJ/kg) showed the lift and pitching moment coefficients remained constant with an equivalence ratio of 0.8 but the thrust coefficient decreased exponentially with increasing stagnation enthalpies. Good agreement of experimental values of lift and thrust force with predicted values was obtained for equivalence ratios of 0.0 and 0.8. Choking occurred at stagnation enthalpies of less than 3.0MJ/kg and a nozzle supply pressure of 32MPa with fuel injection at an equivalence ratio of approximately 0.8, resulting in a drag force of approximately 2.5 times the fuel-off drag force. Tests at a nozzle supply enthalpy of 3.3MJ/kg and nozzle supply pressures of 32, 26 and 16MPa were performed at equivalence ratios of 0.0 and 0.8. The fuel-off lift coefficient remained constant but the thrust coefficient increased. This is attributed to a reduction in skin friction associated with longer lengths of laminar boundary layers as the Reynolds number was decreased. The measured fuel-off lift and thrust coefficients agreed with the predicted values to within the known test flow and force prediction uncertainties. Combustion did not occur at a nozzle supply pressure of 16MPa. This work has demonstrated that overall scramjet vehicle performance measurements (such as lift-to-drag ratio and shifts in centre-of-pressure) can be made in a free piston shock tunnel.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290299 Aerospace Engineering not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">690302 Space transport</field><field name="subject">shock tunnel</field><field name="subject">force measurement</field><field name="subject">scramjet</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding the Kanji Learning Process: Strategies, Identification and Behaviour of Learners of Japanese as a Foreign Language</field><field name="creator">Haththotuwa Gamage, Gayathri</field><field name="description">Research into kanji (Chinese characters used in Japan) learning and recognition has given rise to various theories on how kanji are learnt and identified by non-native learners of Japanese. However, an overall understanding of the underlying process by which they learn kanji remains unclear. The aim of this thesis was thus to produce a synthesis of kanji learning from cognitive outcomes and socio-cognitive behaviour to perceived strategies among learners of Japanese as a foreign language (JFL). This was examined through three separate but interrelated studies. The first study examined the use of kanji learning strategies and their perceived efficacy by JFL learners by means of a questionnaire. The second study examined the outcomes of identifying single kanji characters by means of a kanji identification task. Finally, the third study explored kanji learning behaviour in detail by examining affective factors, kanji attributes and the effect of instructional methods on six beginner JFL learners over a semester of kanji study. Analysis of Study 1 revealed three main categories of kanji learning strategies, namely, mnemonic, analytic and rote learning. On average, learners claimed that the strategies they used most were also most helpful. Despite their exposure to Chinese characters, the learners from Chinese backgrounds studying in Australia demonstrated similar preferences for kanji learning strategies to English first language (L1) learners, while learners from Sri Lanka showed preferences for different types of strategies to these two groups. Study 2 revealed that all learners performed better in matching kanji with their shapes than with their meanings or pronunciations (readings). Chinese L1 learners performed better than their alphabetic (English L1) or alphasyllabic (Sinhalese L1) counterparts in matching the meanings and shapes of kanji. Similarity, whether in shape, pronunciation or meaning, did impair the performances of all JFL learners. The findings of Study 3 underpin the need to develop individualised learning styles within the kanji classroom. Some learners collaborated with their study partner in finding solutions; some demonstrated abilities to recognise and assess their own learning behaviour, and others initiated and developed activities for learning kanji to varying degrees. In general, experiences of staying in Japan appeared to have produced negative impressions regarding kanji study. Moreover, asymmetries in reading and writing were prevalent among the learners. In spite of the varied instructional modes exercised on the learner groups, all learners were able to assess the strengths and weaknesses in each method and develop their own kanji-learning styles. Taken together, the three studies reported in this thesis all contributed to deepening our understanding of the kanji learning process of pre-intermediate and beginner JFL learners. These three studies constitute the starting point in the endeavour to propose a framework for kanji learning.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">420113 Japanese</field><field name="subject">330100 Education Studies</field><field name="subject">751001 Languages and literature</field><field name="subject">Kanji</field><field name="subject">learning process</field><field name="subject">strategies</field><field name="subject">identification</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158038</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of Novel Starch Materials: Structure-Functionality Relationship</field><field name="creator">Tan, Ihwa</field><field name="description">Starch is an attractive raw material for biodegradable plastic applications due to its low cost, its availability in large quantities and its excellent thermal process-ability using conventional plastic processing equipments. Despite its attractive potential as a biopolymer material, the use of starch in biodegradable plastic applications is yet limited by its structural and functional properties, which are dictated by its genetic make up. This dissertation involves in-depth characterisations of a range of biotechnologically derived novel starches from different cereal sources to elucidate the relationship between starch structure and functionality. The importance of understanding starch structure-functionality relationship to further the development of starch biodegradable plastics are discussed to identify the research questions, which underlie the motivation of this dissertation and to contextualize the objectives of this dissertation. Diversities in starch macromolecular properties namely the amylose content and amylopectin chain length distribution are evident in these novel starches. The variation in amylopectin structure in these novel starches is explicable by considering the particular inhibition of starch biosynthesis gene expression in the generation of these starch mutants. Amylose content and amylopectin chain length distribution are two separate structural parameters in starch, which influence the granular and functional properties of starch. An improved method to analyse the 13C solid state NMR spectra for native starches was developed in this dissertation and provides the first elucidation on the occurrence of V-type polymorph, which is significant in high amylose starches. An increase in starch amylose content (or decrease in amylopectin content) leads to a decrease in the double helix content and crystallinity. A transition in the double helical packing arrangement of amylopectin side chains from A-type to B-type polymorph is noted for high amylose starches. This can be attributed to the changes in their amylopectin chain length distribution, which leads to the tendency of the glucan chains to form the B-type polymorph during crystallisation from thermodynamic considerations. The application of MTDSC provides the first elucidation on the step transition or heat capacity change, which is noted to occur within the gelatinisation endotherm for all starches. The use of Rheoscope, which allows for simultaneous monitoring of the changes in starch granular and rheological properties during gelatinisation, reveals that the manifested changes in viscosity can be attributed to the increase in the granules size as a result of swelling, the change in granules properties from rigid to more deformable granules due to water penetration and the increase in the viscosity of the continuous phase due to leaching of amylose. The variation in starch gelatinisation thermal properties namely the onset temperature, enthalpy and heat capacity change can be attributed to the variation in amylopectin chain length distribution, amylose content and the amount of starch structural order. A reduction in swelling power with increasing amylose content is consistently noted for all starch types. The variation in starch rheological responses during gelatinisation can be mainly attributed to the swelling ability of starch granules and their granule size distribution (to a lesser extent). Further MTDSC investigations on starch gelatinisation in the presence of water and glycerol with different concentrations indicate that plasticisation of starch granules prior to gelatinisation does not occur. The observed mid-temperature of the step transition (heat capacity change) is more likely due to a change in state of the starch macromolecules from being highly restrained within the granular packing to entangled macromolecules (as the order to disorder transition occurs) rather than due to glass transition. The addition of glycerol promotes starch gelatinisation in a similar way as the addition of water, which suggests that the same structural changes occur during gelatinisation regardless of the solvents used. In summary, the following starch structure-functionality relationships are deduced. The variation in starch macromolecular properties can be attributed to their corresponding mutation of starch biosynthetic genes expression. The variation in starch amylose content affects the extent of structural order inside the granules while the double helix packing arrangement is influenced by the amylopectin chain length distribution. Starch gelatinisation thermal properties are mainly influenced by the amylopectin chain length distribution while the swelling power and rheological properties are mainly affected by the amylose content.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">starch</field><field name="subject">characterisation</field><field name="subject">novel starches</field><field name="subject">starch structure</field><field name="subject">starch functionality</field><field name="subject">structure-functionality relationship</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158037</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In/visibility: Women looking at men's bodies in and through contemporary Australian women's fiction</field><field name="creator">Bode, Katherine</field><field name="description">Masculinity is an increasingly prominent and important issue in debates within feminism, literary studies and visual theory. This study intervenes in and contributes to such debates by analysing an emerging group of Australian women&#146;s fictions (published between 1998 and 2002) which focus on male characters and, in particular, on the description and narrative potential of their bodies. The majority of these texts, and the ones that are explored in this thesis &#150; namely, Jillian Watkinson&#146;s The Architect, Georgia Blain&#146;s The Blind Eye, Mireille Juchau&#146;s Machines for Feeling, Fiona Capp&#146;s Last of the Sane Days, Sarah Myles&#146;s Transplanted and Wendy Scarfe&#146;s Miranda &#150; share two preoccupations. Firstly, male characters bodies&#146; are almost always damaged or suffering in some way; secondly, the ability (or inability) of female characters to look at these bodies is repeatedly foregrounded. I argue that the interactions between male characters&#146; bodies and female characters&#146; gazes function in complex ways both to confirm and to challenge patriarchal constructions of masculinity and male corporeality. Specifically, this occurs in relation to the engagement of each text with popular discourses of feminism and masculinity crisis, discourses that emerge and interact in complex and often contradictory ways in depictions of male visibility and exposure. While my approach is generally feminist, it is also fiction-centred. Thus, I draw on a variety of theoretical perspectives, including literary theory, masculinity studies, visual theory, history, sociology and philosophy, in order to unpack and engage with these contemporary Australian women&#146;s fictions. Paradoxically, one of the main consequences of this fiction-centred approach is a reengagement with and a rethinking of theoretical concepts emerging from psychoanalytic feminist film theory. In a remarkably consistent and explicitly pedagogical way, these fictions explore notions of objectification and dichotomisation, especially as they are elucidated in Laura Mulvey&#146;s analysis of Hollywood narrative cinema. Objectification is overwhelmingly aligned with oppressive power structures and identified as problematic, and the first half of this thesis explores the novels&#146; critiques of this mode of visual interaction. The second half investigates the alternatives to objectification imagined in these fictions. While, upon closer consideration, some of these alternatives recapture male and female characters within traditional patriarchal power relations, others enable a rethinking of both women&#146;s vision and desire, and men&#146;s subjectivity, visibility and desirability.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">420303 Culture, Gender, Sexuality</field><field name="subject">751001 Languages and literature</field><field name="subject">masculinity</field><field name="subject">female gaze</field><field name="subject">men's bodies</field><field name="subject">contemporary Australian women's fiction</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158036</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of molten metal surface properties on the formation of surface defects on vertical direct chill cast aluminium alloy products.</field><field name="creator">Bainbridge, Ian Frank</field><field name="description">The DC casting process used for the production of cast aluminium alloy products intended for processing by rolling, extrusion or forging is an economically important process with approximately 10 million tonnes of DC cast product being produced annually world wide [1]. Process productivity, particularly with respect to elimination of casting defects and hence process scrap is an important factor to DC cast product producers. The literature reporting the DC casting process, particularly with respect to the formation of defects on the cast surface, is reviewed and the mechanisms for the formation of such defects examined. A universally understood and accepted explanation was found for only one of the normal surface defects encountered in practice. A number of samples of commercially cast DC products were subject to detailed cast surface examination, particularly surface microstructures. The results of this examination and the literature survey identified molten metal surface tension as a possible contributing factor affecting the molten metal meniscus stability within the DC casting mould. Meniscus instability is linked with the formation of surface defects. The literature on surface tension of aluminium alloys provided only limited information hence the surface tension of a range of binary and ternary alloys, including commercial alloys was determined, producing data hitherto not available. Of the common alloying elements used in commercial aluminium alloys, iron and magnesium were found to significantly reduce the surface tension. Surface fracture also resulted in a reduction in surface tension for the majority of alloys tested. The surface tension data is combined with mould thermal and physical model calculations to propose a mechanism for the formation of the cast surface defects. The model proposes a maximum stable size for the meniscus according to the alloy and mould conditions. Conditions outside these limits result in meniscus instability and the formation of cast surface defects. The model suggests possible operating changes that may reduce the incidence of surface defect formation. The work also identifies a number of areas requiring further investigation before major practical process changes aimed at cast surface defect elimination, may be formulated.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DC Casting</field><field name="subject">Surface Tension</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158035</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ECOLOGY OF TRICHOGRAMMA SPP. IN THE ORD RIVER IRRIGATION AREA AND THEIR ROLE IN COTTON IPM</field><field name="creator">Davies, Andrew Paul</field><field name="description">Trichogramma limit pest damage to Ord River Irrigation Area (ORIA) cotton crops by killing the developing embryo of their insect host at the egg stage, effectively reducing the number of emergent pests ingesting transgenic tissue. Their impact on the potentially resistant species, Helicoverpa armigera (H&#252;bner), is considered integral to the Insect Resistance Management (IRM) strategy for transgenic cotton production in the ORIA. This thesis examines aspects of Trichogramma ecology pertinent to this strategy. The dominant species of egg parasitoid in ORIA cotton crops is the introduced Trichogramma pretiosum Riley. Other species make up less than one percent of collected specimens. Surveys revealed T. pretiosum has been introduced or adventitiously dispersed to all developed agricultural regions of northern Australia. Several new species were discovered during surveys in more pristine habitats. Based on field collected eggs, T. pretiosum appears to prefer H. armigera over H. punctigera Wallengren as a host in ORIA cotton. Measured as percent parasitism, Trichogramma activity appears highly variable and does not necessarily coincide with periods of peak insect pest density. Host abundance alone does not define conditions suitable for Trichogramma activity. Environmental constraints on wasp survival, such as the impact of temperature, humidity and insecticide applications, limit their effectiveness in biological control. Despite consistently high rates of percentage egg parasitism (60-99%), acceptable pest control is not readily achieved in ORIA cotton without the aid of insecticides as Helicoverpa numbers exceed damage thresholds. Insecticides inhibit Trichogramma considerably, hence the conundrum regarding initiation of insecticidal control. Trichogramma activity is relatively high early season (May to July), significantly limiting the buildup of pests. Trichogramma effectively stifle Helicoverpa population increase following initial pest egg lay at least during high density years. The impact of farming practices, especially insecticide applications, should be avoided early season to ensure pest mortality attributed to Trichogramma egg parasitisation is maximised. Pre-season habitat manipulation to establish large populations of Trichogramma in alternative hosts is advised. Despite being rare in surrounding habitats and suffering near 50% immature mortality in the field, Trichogramma effectively disperse into young crops attractive to ovipositing hosts and display a high intrinsic rate of increase. Spatial patterns of parasitism tend toward heterogeneity and do not necessarily coincide with host spatio-temporal dynamics. Both host abundance patterns and mean rates of parasitism are not good indicators of parasitoid patchiness. Parasitism rates are highest within the middle strata of the plant canopy prior to complete canopy closure despite a similar number of host eggs being available elsewhere in the plant. Pest density declines as the season progresses. However, insecticide applications become necessary if Bt expression in cotton plants wanes and larval damage increases. Measuring parasitism during periods of declining and low host density is prone to inaccuracy due to small sample size, but can be overcome with the use of egg cards. A better indication of parasitoid activity is achieved using egg cards during periods when insecticide applications are possibly required. As Trichogramma are most active in ORIA cotton from morning to early afternoon, insecticide applications if needed should occur outside of these periods. Trichogramma survival is constrained by environmental influences. Adult female T. pretiosum were exposed to ambient conditions in dialysis tubing sleeve cages to test survival and fecundity in cotton fields. Peak survival and fecundity occurs mid season with both life history variants displaying an inverse relationship to temperature. Adult female T. pretiosum survive longest in the field when provided with sustenance however mortality attributed to handling was considerable. Sleeve cages are not effective for survival measurement of small parasitoids if the cages are frequently moved. Trichogramma effectively reduce pest abundance but are clearly hindered by insecticides and hot dry conditions in ORIA cotton crops. The decision to initiate insecticide applications is best delayed unless absolutely necessary to avoid disruption of Trichogramma impact on pests. Parasitoid activity must be carefully monitored if chemical control becomes imminent. The impact of Trichogramma on pest species can then be optimally exploited.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Trichogramma</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">IPM</field><field name="subject">IRM</field><field name="subject">Bt cotton</field><field name="subject">ORIA</field><field name="subject">Helicoverpa</field><field name="subject">Ord</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158034</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multidimensional viscous flows at superorbital speeds</field><field name="creator">Silvester, Todd</field><field name="description">A combined experimental and numerical study of multidimensional viscous flows at speeds exceeding 8 km/s is reported. Experiments were performed in the X3 superorbital expansion tube with air and nitrogen test flows at a Mach number and total enthalpy of 10 and 40 MJ/kg, respectively. Laminar skin friction, heat flux and pressure measurements were obtained at regular intervals along one wall of a rectangular duct. The spatial resolution of the transducers was chosen to capture the multidimensional flow phenomena within the duct. Quasi-steady flow periods were established along the entire length of the duct in the test times offered by the expansion tube. Direct skin friction measurements were accomplished through the use of &#145;in house&#146; acceleration compensated transducers. The successful operation of these skin friction transducers in a high performance expansion tube was demonstrated. Furthermore, the systematic uncertainty in measured shear stress was significantly reduced with the development of a new pressure calibration technique. For the conditions tested, Reynolds analogy was shown to be valid to within experimental uncertainty. The experimental data was in excellent agreement with numerical estimates. Three-dimensional numerical simulations of the diverging duct revealed that the flowfield structure in the vicinity of the corners differs from that of an unbounded corner or a constant area duct. Real gas effects other than those present in the residual nonequilibrium levels of freestream dissociation were negligible for the conditions tested. A computational study of two waverider configurations recently tested in the X3 superorbital expansion tube was conducted to assist in the interpretation of past results. The off-design aerodynamic performance was also analyzed and showed that blunting the leading edges dramatically degraded the performance by increasing drag and decreasing lift for the conditions considered.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">780102 Physical sciences</field><field name="subject">290207 Satellite, Space Vehicle and Missile Design</field><field name="subject">viscous flows</field><field name="subject">expansion tubes</field><field name="subject">hypervelocity</field><field name="subject">skin friction</field><field name="subject">Reynolds analogy</field><field name="subject">CFD</field><field name="subject">real gas effects</field><field name="subject">multidimensional flows</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158032</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acumen, Ambivalence and Ambiguity: Stories of women with asthma</field><field name="creator">Rose, Gabrielle Maree</field><field name="description">Australia has one of the highest prevalence rates of asthma in the world and is one of the leading countries in the public health approach to the problem. Yet despite advances biomedical and public health discourses still provide various definitions of asthma and, at times, contradictory models of aetiology, treatment and prevention. These contrasting views are disseminated to the public by the media and in clinical encounters: they inform medical practice, pharmaceutical policy, and public perceptions and responses to the illness. In this thesis I explore the convergences and discrepancies in the representation of asthma and contrast these with the lived experiences of women with asthma. The thesis draws on research undertaken in Queensland, Australia, with women with asthma, and with their physicians and other people working in the field of asthma policy, practice and research. It is a medical anthropological approach to the problem of asthma and uses qualitative and quantitative methods in the collection of data. It then triangulates the qualitative and quantitative findings. The quantitative data are presented first and these are juxtaposed with the qualitative findings. The major concepts to emerge from the qualitative data include the acumen women have in terms of knowledge of their asthma; ambivalence in managing their asthma; and ambiguity in terms of the quality of their life. The findings of the research demonstrate that women with asthma, and the institutions in place to deal with it, suffocate, metaphorically keeping bodies just below the surface, suppressing their life in lieu of their illness. The central argument in this thesis is that despite positive advances in the area of asthma research, policy and practice, the continuing reliance on medical and public health models for the creation of knowledge in the area of chronic illness fails to adequately respond to the needs of women with asthma. The fundamental outcome of the research shows that the social and cultural capital a woman with asthma has in relation to knowledge, attitudes and practices, translates into disposition towards the management of her chronic condition. This is sometimes in direct contrast with existing knowledges. I argue that instead of research and practice that focuses on the deficits in knowledge of people with asthma, an asset-based approach to the problem of asthma &#150; one that focuses on existing knowledge, attitudes and practices of these women may assist in managing the chronic illness condition in a more effective fashion.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">asthma</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">anthropology</field><field name="subject">public health</field><field name="subject">qualitative research</field><field name="subject">chronic illness</field><field name="subject">feminism</field><field name="subject">quality of life</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158033</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Marriage Breakdown in Australia: social correlates, gender and initiator status.</field><field name="creator">Hewitt, Belinda Anne</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the social determinants of marriage breakdown in Australia. Research shows that a number of social characteristics including, birth cohort, ethnic background, parental divorce, family socioeconomic background, cohabitation, religiosity, premarital birth, early birth, marital children and education are associated with marriage breakdown. Using retrospective data on 8,993 first marriages from the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey (2001), a large nationally representative Australian population survey, this study aims to develop our knowledge of gender differences in the social correlates of marriage breakdown and in particular to better understand why women are more likely than men to initiate separation. I do this in two ways. First, I use discrete time event history analysis to examine differences in the associations between men&#146;s and women&#146;s social characteristics and the probability of marriage breakdown. Overall these results suggest that social characteristics are important factors in predicting marriage breakdown. I find gender differences in the associations between age at marriage, ethnic background and education showing these characteristics have a stronger association with the probability of marriage breakdown for women than men. This may be because women are more likely to initiate separation. Second, I use discrete time event history analysis with competing risks to examine the associations between men&#146;s and women&#146;s social characteristics and their reports of which spouse initiated separation. Instead of treating marriage breakdown as a uniform event I investigate whether separation was initiated by the wife, husband or jointly. This issue has received little attention in the literature to date. My results suggest some differences in the associations between parental divorce, age at marriage, ethnic background, religiosity, and the presence of preschool and older children and whether wives or husbands initiated separation. All of these characteristics with the exception of the presence of preschool children increase the risk of wife-initiated separation, but overall there are few differences between wifeinitiated and husband-initiated separations and when there are significant differences it is usually in the magnitude of the effect rather than in the direction of the association. The main gender difference I find is that wives are more likely than husbands to initiate separation on the basis of their husbands&#146; as well as their own social characteristics. Overall, the findings of this thesis suggest three main conclusions. First, that sociostructural factors are important for understanding why some marriages break down and others remain intact. Second, wives are more likely to initiate marital separation than husbands. And third, while some gender differences in the social correlates of which spouse initiated separation are present, in general men and women tend to end their marriages under similar circumstances. It is likely that more wives initiate separation than husbands because women tend to take greater responsibility for the quality and maintenance of marital relationships which paradoxically entails ending an unhappy marriage in some circumstances. Investigating this issue further was outside the scope of this study and represents an important direction for future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158353</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Ecology, Management and Monitoring of Wildlife Populations in Fragmented Landscapes - a Koala Case Study</field><field name="creator">Rhodes, Jonathan Roger</field><field name="description">Habitat destruction and degradation are the most important threatening processes for the majority of species of conservation concern. As landscapes become more fragmented their spatial structure becomes increasingly important for the viability of wildlife populations. Therefore, understanding the dynamics of how populations interact with landscape structure is crucial for developing effective wildlife management and monitoring strategies. To achieve robust management, such an understanding should be incorporated into decision theory approaches for the design of management and monitoring strategies. Monitoring is a crucial component for assessing the outcome of management, because this can then be used to inform future management actions in an adaptive management framework. However, for many species, their spatial population dynamics are not well understood and objective management frameworks not well developed. In this thesis I use modelling approaches to develop the components of an adaptive management framework for species of conservation concern that occur in fragmented landscapes. I use the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) as a study organism and specifically address three key components that are important for adaptive management. These components are: (1) the development of novel approaches for modelling and understanding spatial population processes, (2) the application of modelling approaches to develop general principles and methods for managing wildlife populations in fragmented landscapes and (3) the application of modelling approaches to identify the best spatio-temporal sampling strategies for monitoring population trends in fragmented landscapes. This research advances our understanding of the dynamics of wildlife populations in fragmented landscapes, but importantly also develops tools and general principles for the adaptive management of these populations. To improve our understanding of the dynamics of populations in fragmented landscapes I develop several novel modelling approaches. Firstly, I develop an approach for disassociating the effect of natural habitat and anthropogenic influences on population distributions using static occupancy models. This approach allows inferences to be made about how important the distribution of habitat is compared to other human-related factors. Secondly, I develop modelling approaches for understanding habitat selection and dispersal processes. In particular, I address common problems for modelling complex habitat selection processes and parameterising dispersal simulation models. The habitat selection models are novel because they account for habitat preferences that depend upon the spatial location of habitat. The novel emphasis for the dispersal models, is showing that pattern-oriented approaches are useful for parameterising dispersal simulation models, even when we have little data. These models make an important contribution to our understanding of and methods for understanding spatial population processes. These and other modelling approaches are then applied to some key management questions, in order to develop general principles and methods for wildlife management decision-making. These studies relate to identifying the best spatial allocation of different management strategies, the planning of road networks to minimise impacts on wildlife and the impact of different mortality rates on the ranking of habitat protection strategies. First, I show that the relative spatial distribution of habitat and anthropogenic influences has important implications for the spatial allocation of management strategies. Second, I show that increasing traffic volume on existing roads is generally preferential to building new roads in terms of minimising the impact on wildlife mortality. Third, I use a multi-criteria decision analysis to show that the spatial arrangement of protected habitat is much less important for populations subject to high mortality rates than those subject to low mortality rates. Finally, spatially-explicit modelling approaches are applied to questions related to how sampling effort should best be allocated spatially and spatio-temporally to monitor population trends. These studies reveal that the best sampling strategy depends predictably upon the monitoring objectives and the dynamics of the species. Using the principles developed, improved monitoring strategies and ultimately improved management strategies will be possible. This thesis makes an important contribution to the development of adaptive management strategies for wildlife populations in fragmented landscapes. To implement an adaptive management approach, the modelling, management and monitoring components must be explicitly linked. By developing each of these components, this thesis provides a strong basis from which an adaptive management framework can be constructed. How this may be achieved and key areas for future research are discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">adaptive management</field><field name="subject">monitoring</field><field name="subject">fragmented landscapes</field><field name="subject">landscape ecology</field><field name="subject">population dynamics</field><field name="subject">koala</field><field name="subject">Phascolarctos cinereus</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158031</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isan deformation, magmatism and extensional kinematics in the Western Fold Belt of the Mount Isa Inlier</field><field name="creator">Gordon, Ricky James</field><field name="description">The Mount Isa and May Downs Faults are part of a network of significant faults that define, control, or partition deformation in the Early to mid-Proterozoic Mount Isa Inlier. The middle Proterozoic deformation history includes at least two extensional basin-forming events (Leichhardt Superbasin: ~1800 Ma to ~1700 Ma and Isa Superbasin: ~1700 Ma to ~ 1600 Ma) and a major protracted contractional orogenic event (Isan Orogeny: ~1585 Ma to ~ 1500 Ma). Uplift between the Mount Isa and May Downs Faults during the Isan Orogeny has exposed mid to upper amphibolite facies rocks of the structurally deeper levels of the early rift systems. Also exposed is the Sybella Granite, a composite batholith of variably deformed gneissic granite, which, at ~1660 Ma, is broadly coeval with inception of the Isan Superbasin basin. Two prevailing kinematic models had been proposed for the fault systems during Isan Superbasin formation. The traditionally accepted model involves episodic E-W or NW-SE extension with the N-S Mount Isa Fault, but Southgate et al (2000b) presented an alternative sinistral strike-slip model in which the May Downs Fault acted as a releasing bend fault associated with motion on the Mt Isa Fault. In the Southgate model, the Sybella Granite was interpreted as syn-tectonically filling the dilational releasing bend. This study provides a detailed structural analysis of the 100 km by 40 km area west of Mount Isa City lying between the Mount Isa and May Downs Faults. The aim was to resolve a number of outstanding issues, including those outlined above. The resultant 1:250 000 structural map of the area is based on: reconnaissance-scale mapping; aerial photography, satellite, magnetic and radiometric image interpretation; field observations at locations throughout the area; and local detailed mapping (1:12000 scale or less). The mapping and associated geometrical analysis of the area has shown that the Sybella Batholith consists of two granite sills and a more globular body of microgranite. The deepest, gneissic, sill is up to 5 km thick and was emplaced at about 15 km below the basal Mount Isa Group unconformity (palaeosurface). The other, less deformed, sill formed higher in the crust, and the microgranite intruded to within 1-2 km of the palaeosurface. The two sills are located between two major fault systems (Mount Isa and May Downs Faults) that developed from inherited basin margin faults. The fault systems dip toward each other and the rocks between them have been folded into a single large antiform and uplifted as a wedge. Previous interpretations of the area have suggested that the batholith consists of a single sill folded by tighter, shorter wavelength folds. A cross-sectional reconstruction of the study area suggests that thin-skinned processes dominated much of the Isan Orogeny, contrary to previous interpretations. A three-dimensional reconstruction of the area, evaluated by comparing the predicted strain and amount of shortening with measured strain and shortening estimates, suggests deformation was driven by a rigid block to the west of the May Downs Fault moving toward the northeast. In the restored pre-Isan geometry, both the margins of the lowermost gneissic granite sill and its immediate country rocks have a strong, horizontal, layer-parallel, shear foliation with top-to-the-east asymmetry. The fabrics are strongly constrictional and 2 Abstract the stretching lineation trends east-west. Field observations and thin sectional analysis of these fabrics provide positive evidence that the Sybella Batholith was syn-tectonically emplaced in a basin-forming environment. A kinematic model is presented to show that these features are consistent with granite emplacement into a dilational jog in a sub-horizontal shear zone with a top-to-the-east shear sense. A component of east-west directed horizontal simple shear across the dilating zone explains the strongly constrictional fabrics in the granite. Under these conditions significant north-south shortening in the deforming zone leads to the initiation of folds parallel to the stretching direction (as observed). The shear zone into which the granite was emplaced developed at about fifteen kilometres depth and was probably at or near the brittle-ductile transition. The consistent shear sense, very high strains and implied 30 km of translation required to accommodate the sill indicates that this was a major crustal structure, rather than a simple detachment at the brittle-ductile transition in a crustal pure shear extension. The results are consistent with the east-west extensional model for basin development and totally inconsistent with the sinistral strike-slip model.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260107 Structural Geology</field><field name="subject">780104 Earth sciences</field><field name="subject">Mount Isa</field><field name="subject">Sybella Granite</field><field name="subject">Mount Isa Fault</field><field name="subject">May Downs Fault</field><field name="subject">Basin reconstruction</field><field name="subject">kinematics</field><field name="subject">Structure</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158030</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Respect for the world: Universal ethics and the morality of terraforming</field><field name="creator">York, Paul Francis</field><field name="description">This dissertation aims to develop an ethical system that can properly frame such questions as the morality of large-scale efforts to transform inanimate parts of nature, for example, proposals to terraform Mars. Such an ethics diverges from traditional approaches to ethics because it expands the class of entities regarded as morally considerable to include inanimate entities. I approach the task by building on the environmental ethical theory of Paul W. Taylor, as developed in his 1986 book Respect for Nature: A Theory of Environmental Ethics. I discuss various criticisms of Taylor and propose two extensions to his theory: an expansion of the scope of moral considerability to include all concrete material objects and the introduction of the concept of variable moral significance (the notion that all entities have inherent worth but some have more than others). Using Taylor&#146;s modified and extended theory as a foundation, I develop something I call universal ethics. This is an ethical framework whose key elements are a fundamental ethical attitude of respect for the world and a principle of minimal harm. Universal ethics regards all concrete material entities, whether living or not, and whether natural or artefactual, as inherently valuable, and therefore as entitled to the respect of moral agents. I offer a defence of this ethical framework and discuss a number of practical applications, including criticism of proposals for the terraforming of Mars. I conclude that terraforming Mars or any other celestial body at this point in our history would be morally wrong. I also suggest that universal ethics provides an ethical foundation for efforts to protect Antarctica, and that it has implications for our relations to other inanimate parts of our world, including artefacts.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">780199 Other</field><field name="subject">440103 Ethical Theory</field><field name="subject">environmental philosophy</field><field name="subject">environmental ethics</field><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="subject">inherent worth</field><field name="subject">complexity</field><field name="subject">integrity</field><field name="subject">information</field><field name="subject">moral considerability</field><field name="subject">moral significance</field><field name="subject">moral standing</field><field name="subject">principle of minimal harm</field><field name="subject">imperative to knowledge</field><field name="subject">Mars</field><field name="subject">Antarctica</field><field name="subject">inanimate nature</field><field name="subject">artefacts</field><field name="subject">vandalism</field><field name="subject">extraterrestrial</field><field name="subject">Paul W Taylor</field><field name="subject">anthropocentrism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158029</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aeration due to Breaking waves</field><field name="creator">Cummings, Peter D.</field><field name="description">The exchange of mass (gases, water &amp; salts) between the oceans and the atmosphere is vital to the maintenance of life on earth. At high wind velocities most of this exchange is attributable to breaking wave entrained air bubbles. A vertical supported planar plunging jet experiment was used to model the entrainment process. The bubbles were detected with a dual tip conductivity probe and a video camera. At plunging jet velocities below 1.0m/s there is no bubble entrainment. This inception velocity appears to have a Froude and Weber number scaling for large rough turbulent jets. At jet velocities up to 5m/s air appeared to be entrained via intermittent air cavities at the jet - plunge pool intersection. The entrained air packets subsequently break in the two phase free shear layer under the entrainment point. At higher jet velocities there may be partial penetration of the aerated jet surface via pulsating induction cavities plus air entrainment via jet self aeration before impact. Plunging jet air flow data displays the different types of entrainment mechanisms. Mono-phase diffusion models can be successfully adapted to describe the shear layer developing zone. The diffusion of the air bubbles is approximately a Gaussian self similar process. The mean bubble velocity profiles can be modelled using the Goertler Error function or Hyperbolic Tangent models. The bubble spectra is approximately Lognormal with a geometric mean diameter of 1.0-2.0mm for a range of jet velocities. A bubble Weber number is found to model the maximum bubble size of approximately 10mm diameter. An original adaptation of the potential flow solution for the vortex sheet is shown to be a simple and reasonably accurate finite amplitude model for water surface gravity waves, especially in deep water. This model has some interesting features, such as both vertical and horizontal asymmetry and standing wave water profile modelling. A simple and possibly insightful model of wave growth due to the wind is introduced, using a constant sea surface Reynolds number U*.sqrt(L.F)/Gamma , where U* = wind friction velocity, L = wavelength, F = fetch, and Gamma = wave field vortex circulation per wavelength. The results may have application in the modelling of air - sea gas exchanges, predicting breaking wave forces on structures and the use of the planar plunging jet as an aeration device in industry.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aeration</field><field name="subject">Plunging jets</field><field name="subject">Plunging breaking waves</field><field name="subject">Air bubble entrainment</field><field name="subject">Physical Modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158028</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Turbulent flows in non-uniform open channels : experimental measurements and numerical modelling</field><field name="creator">XIE, Qi</field><field name="description">Investigations into the turbulent flows in uniform and nonuniform open channels by previous researchers have demonstrated the requirement and importance of understanding the turbulence structures and energy losses due to irregularity in non- uniform open channels. Responding to this requirement, the turbulent flow in one special non-uniform open channel has been studied both experimentally and numerically. This non-uniform open channel was designed so that its width and bed level vary while its cross-sectional area below the water surface keeps constant. An upstream uniforzn open channel is attached to the non-uniform open channel to establish fully developed turbulent flow conditions. A downstream uniform channel is also attached for control of water depth and downstream flow condition. The experimental study consisted of measurements of turbulent velocity field with a LDV (Laser Doppler Velocimetry) and measurements of boundary shear stress (BSS) with Roving Preston tubes in the experimental channel. Turbulent velocity components in the longitudinal and vertical directions were measured with the LDV in forward scattering mode and the laser beams were focused from the channel side wall into the water. Turbulent velocity components in the longitudinal and transverse directions were measured with the LDV in back scattering mode and the laser beams are focused from above the water surface into the water. Both the forward scattering mode measurements and the back scattering mode measurements were taken at two cross sections in the upstream uniform open-channel and at twelve cross sections in the nonuniform open channel. Obtained data include mean longitudinal velocity U, transverse velocity V, vertical velocity W, turbulence intensities u^2, v^2, w^2, and Reynolds shear stresses -uv and -uw. The chief results of these measurements are: 1) There is no separation of flow in the nonuniform open channel. 2) As flow passes from wider and shallower section to narrower and deeper section, it responds as though it experiences contraction in horizontal planes and expansion in vertical planes. The reverse occurs as flow passes from narrower and deeper section to wider and shallower section; 3) The secondary currents in the nonuniform open channel are combinations of the effects of pure contraction and expansion of channel boundaries and the effects of the vortex kind secondary currents; 4) Turbulence intensities in the non-uniform open channel show similar distribution patterns to that in the uniform open-channel but their magnitudes change due to the change of channel shape; 5) Negative values of the Reynolds shear stresses, -uw, appear at the free surface and may extend to a large depth below the free surface in the nonuniform open channel. Boundary shear stresses in the experimental channel were measured with Roving Preston tubes. The use of the Roving Preston tubes was preceded with calibrations of themselves in air pipe flow and calibrations of a special pressure transducer in air and in water. Delicate measurement procedures were designed for measurements of BSS in the nonuniform open channel. The BSS were measured at one cross section in the uniform open-channel and at twelve cross sections in the nonuniform open channel. The chief results of these measurements are: 1) The irregularity of the nonuniform open channel significantly affects the distribution of the BSS but the total shear force has little change; 2) The effect of the secondary currents on the BSS is very similar to the effect of secondary currents on the ESS in uniform open channel; 3) The irregularity in the non-uniform open channel does not cause extra energy loss since there is no flow separation. The numerical study made use of a FEM (finite element method) commercial package FIDAP to simulate the turbulent flows in the experimental channel. These simulations are carried out with Speziale's eddy-viscosity anisotropic k-E model, the standard k-E model, and the RNG model. With each model, simulations were undertaken for four consecutive uniform channels of 5 m length so that fully developed turbulent flow conditions were established before entering into the simulation of flow in the non- uniform channel. In all simulations the free surfaces were fixed. Simulation results include U, V, W, k, and E. For turbulent flow in the uniform channel, only Speziale's model is capable of predicting qualitatively correct secondary currents. For turbulent flow in the non-uniform open channel, all three models gave similar simulation results. The calculated distribution patterns of U and W are in agreement with measurements except near the free surface but differences exist in magnitude. None of the three models was capable of modelling the transverse velocity V in the nonuniform open channel correctly. Further simulations are necessary with movable free surface and better boundary condition for the energy dissipation rate s in order to achieve better agreement with the experimental values, especially near the free surface.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Turbulence</field><field name="subject">Open channel</field><field name="subject">Non uniform flows</field><field name="subject">Laser Soppler anemometry LDA 2 components</field><field name="subject">Reynolds stress</field><field name="subject">bounary shear stress</field><field name="subject">measurements</field><field name="subject">physical modelling</field><field name="subject">numerical modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158027</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Validation of a CFD Solver for Hypersonic Flows</field><field name="creator">Elford, Michael Charles</field><field name="description">In this thesis the validation of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code against published experimental data and alternative CFD results is explored. Six case studies are presented with flow speeds ranging from mid supersonic to hypersonic. The studies include complex compressible flow phenomena such as the interaction of shockwaves with boundary layers, vortices and other shockwaves. Two of the six validation cases also consider complex thermodynamic behaviour such as vibrational and chemical nonequilibrium. The problems chosen are limited in scope to flows which are planar or axisymmetric and remain laminar throughout the region of flow studied. This allows the studies to focus on simulating the fundamental behaviour of the flow without the added complication of turbulence or the need for large scale computing facilities. The problems which arose during the validation studies and a background to why they occurred and, wherever possible, strategies to avoid their occurrence are discussed. General modelling strategies in compressible CFD are also discussed. In this thesis the software suite CFD-FASTRAN is used to construct and analyse the CFD models. The material presented in this thesis is however general such that users of similar packages should find the thesis beneficial.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290299 Aerospace Engineering not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">780102 Physical sciences</field><field name="subject">Hypersonics</field><field name="subject">CFD</field><field name="subject">CFD-FASTRAN</field><field name="subject">validation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158026</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rehabilitation of Exterior RC Beam-Column Joints using Web-Bonded FRP Sheets</field><field name="creator">Mahini, Seyed Saeid</field><field name="description">In a Reinforced Concrete (RC) building subjected to lateral loads such as earthquake and wind pressure, the beam to column joints constitute one of the critical regions, especially the exterior ones, and they must be designed and detailed to dissipate large amounts of energy without a significant loss of, strength, stiffness and ductility. This would be achieved when the beam-column joints are designed in such a way that the plastic hinges form at a distance away from the column face and the joint region remain elastic. In existing frames, an easy and practical way to implement this behaviour following the accepted design philosophy of the strong-column weak-beam concept is the use a Fibre Reinforced Plastic (FRP) retrofitting system. In the case of damaged buildings, this can be achieved through a FRP repairing system. In the experimental part of this study, seven scaled down exterior subassemblies were tested under monotonic or cyclic loads. All specimens were designed following the strong-column weak-beam principal. The three categories selected for this investigation included the FRP-repaired and FRP-retrofitted specimens under monotonic loads and FRP-retrofitted specimen under cyclic loads. All repairing/retrofitting was performed using a new technique called a web-bonded FRP system, which was developed for the first time in the current study. On the basis of test results, it was concluded that the FRP repairing/retrofitting system can restore/upgrade the integrity of the joint, keeping/upgrading its strength, stiffness and ductility, and shifting the plastic hinges from the column face toward the beam in such a way that the joint remains elastic. In the analytical part of this study, a closed-form solution was developed in order to predict the physical behaviour of the repaired/retrofitted specimens. Firstly, an analytical model was developed to calculate the ultimate moment capacity of the web-bonded FRP sections considering two failure modes, FRP rupture and tension failure, followed by an extended formulation for estimating the beam-tip displacement. Based on the analytical model and the extended formulation, failure mechanisms of the test specimens were implemented into a computer program to facilitate the calculations. All seven subassemblies were analysed using this program, and the results were found to be in good agreement with those obtained from experimental study. Design curves were also developed to be used by practicing engineers. In the numerical part of this study, all specimens were analysed by a nonlinear finite element method using ANSYS software. Numerical analysis was performed for three purposes: to calculate the first yield load of the specimens in order to manage the tests; to investigate the ability of the web-bonded FRP system to relocate the plastic hinge from the column face toward the beam; and to calibrate and confirm the results obtained from the experiments. It was concluded that numerical analysis using ANSYS could be considered as a practical tool in the design of the web-bonded FRP beam-column joints.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reinforced concrete</field><field name="subject">Reinforcement</field><field name="subject">Bar</field><field name="subject">Moment resisting building frame structure</field><field name="subject">strong-column weak-beam principal</field><field name="subject">Exterior Beam-Column Joints</field><field name="subject">Core</field><field name="subject">Small scale modelling</field><field name="subject">Experimental</field><field name="subject">Test set-up</field><field name="subject">Control</field><field name="subject">Plain specimen</field><field name="subject">Rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Retrofitting</field><field name="subject">retrofitted</field><field name="subject">Repair</field><field name="subject">Repaired</field><field name="subject">Repairing</field><field name="subject">Strengthening</field><field name="subject">Controlling</field><field name="subject">Relocating</field><field name="subject">Plastic hinge</field><field name="subject">Pre-cracking</field><field name="subject">Cracking</field><field name="subject">Crushing</field><field name="subject">Post-cracking</field><field name="subject">Crack</field><field name="subject">Cracked</field><field name="subject">Penetration</field><field name="subject">Damaged</field><field name="subject">Pre-cracked</field><field name="subject">Web-Bonded</field><field name="subject">Wrapping</field><field name="subject">De-bonding</field><field name="subject">Fibre Reinforced Plastic</field><field name="subject">FRP</field><field name="subject">Sheets</field><field name="subject">Composite</field><field name="subject">Confinement</field><field name="subject">Monotonic loads</field><field name="subject">Cyclic loading</field><field name="subject">Loads</field><field name="subject">Displacement control</field><field name="subject">Load control</field><field name="subject">Regime</field><field name="subject">Phase</field><field name="subject">Loading sequence</field><field name="subject">Procedure</field><field name="subject">Available ductility factor</field><field name="subject">Curvature ductility factor</field><field name="subject">Ultimate</field><field name="subject">First yield</field><field name="subject">Flexural yielding</field><field name="subject">Strength</field><field name="subject">Moment</field><field name="subject">Stiffness</field><field name="subject">Failure mechanism</field><field name="subject">Modes</field><field name="subject">Sudden</field><field name="subject">Brittle failure</field><field name="subject">Measured beam-tip displacement</field><field name="subject">Deflection</field><field name="subject">Numerical analysis</field><field name="subject">ANSYS</field><field name="subject">Solid65</field><field name="subject">Solid45</field><field name="subject">Link8</field><field name="subject">Non-linear Finite Element (FE)</field><field name="subject">Convergence criteria</field><field name="subject">Analytical</field><field name="subject">Closed from</field><field name="subject">FRP rupture</field><field name="subject">tension failure</field><field name="subject">Compression failure</field><field name="subject">Minimum thickness</field><field name="subject">Maximum thickness</field><field name="subject">Compressive</field><field name="subject">Tensile</field><field name="subject">Steel</field><field name="subject">Ratio</field><field name="subject">Design charts</field><field name="subject">Effective Moment of Inertia</field><field name="subject">Compatibility</field><field name="subject">Strain</field><field name="subject">Stress</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158025</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chinese inscriptions: Australian-born Chinese Lives</field><field name="creator">Tan, Carole Anne</field><field name="description">This thesis represents a transdisciplinary study based on qualitative research and critical analysis of oral history interviews and the personal narratives of sixty-seven Australian-born Chinese.

These are the family, mainstream Australian society and Chinese diasporic spaces located in China and Australia. In examining these three social and cultural spaces, this study seeks to demonstrate that Chineseness represents an inescapable &#145;reality&#146; Australian-born Chinese are compelled to confront in their everyday lives. This &#145;reality&#146; exists despite rights of birth, generational longevity, and strong national and cultural identities and identifications grounded in Australia, and whether or not Australian-born Chinese willingly choose to identify as &#145;Chinese&#146;. Nevertheless, despite the limits of Chineseness Australian-born Chinese experience in their lives, this study demonstrates that Australian-born Chinese are individual agents who devise a range of strategies and tactics which empower them to negotiate Chineseness in relevant and meaningful ways of their own choosing.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">370302 Social and Cultural Anthropology</field><field name="subject">750901 Understanding Australia's past</field><field name="subject">Chinese</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">oral history</field><field name="subject">diaspora</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">family</field><field name="subject">race</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158024</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Animation and Visualisation of Refinements</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Neil John</field><field name="description">Specification animation has become a popular technique in industry, particularly for validation in model-based design processes. Animation tools provide the ability to explore and visualise the behaviour of a model without needing to study its internal workings. Formal refinement techniques should also be of interest to industry since they support verifiably correct transformations of system models towards implementation. So far, however, refinement techniques are not widely used. Their application requires a high degree of mathematical skill, even with the currently available tool support. Better tool support is needed to make refinement techniques accessible to industry. In this thesis we investigate the application of existing specification animation and visualisation tools to problems in refinement theory. We show how animation and visualisation can be used to support verification, by refinement, and validation, by comparing the behaviour of a refined specification against its abstract specification. Such techniques can be used to explain and/or improve the understanding of a refinement and to check for the presence of errors in a refinement, for example, before attempting a proof. In the most challenging cases, data refinements, the designer needs to supply an abstraction relation in order to prove the refinement. We initially assume that an abstraction relation is provided as an input to the verification and validation tasks. However, finding abstraction relations is hard, and is currently a matter of trial and error. We therefore study the problem of finding abstraction relations. We show that, if an abstraction relation exists, there is always a unique weakest abstraction relation and at least one minimal abstraction relation, and we describe algorithms for finding both the weakest abstraction relation and minimal abstraction relations. These algorithms can be applied to small finite-state systems to produce abstraction relations in terms of explicit values of state variables. We then investigate a symbolic algorithm for finding abstraction relations, which can be applied to systems with infinite states, to produce abstraction relations in predicate form. The theory and the algorithms we develop thus make it possible for us to extend our animation-based verification and validation techniques so that they can be used without providing a complete abstraction relation. Additionally our extended techniques can help a designer construct an abstraction relation or check a proposed one.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">refinement</field><field name="subject">animation</field><field name="subject">abstraction relations</field><field name="subject">action systems</field><field name="subject">Z</field><field name="subject">data refinement</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158023</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A macroscopic chemistry method for the direct simulation of non-equilibrium gas flows</field><field name="creator">Lilley, Charles Ranald</field><field name="description">The macroscopic chemistry method for modelling non-equilibrium reacting gas flows with the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method is developed and tested. In the macroscopic method, the calculation of chemical reactions is decoupled from the DSMC collision routine. The number of reaction events that must be performed in a cell is calculated with macroscopic rate expressions. These expressions use local macroscopic information such as kinetic temperatures and density. The macroscopic method is applied to a symmetrical diatomic gas. For each dissociation event, a single diatom is selected with a probability based on internal energy and is dissociated into two atoms. For each recombination event, two atoms are selected at random and replaced by a single diatom. To account for the dissociation energy, the thermal energies of all particles in the cell are adjusted. The macroscopic method differs from conventional collision-based DSMC chemistry procedures, where reactions are performed as an integral part of the collision routine. The most important advantage offered by the macroscopic method is that it can utilise reaction rates that are any function of the macroscopic flow conditions. It therefore allows DSMC chemistry calculations to be performed using rate expressions for which no conventional chemistry model may exist. Given the accuracy and flexibility of the macroscopic method, it has significant potential for modelling reacting non-equilibrium gas flows. The macroscopic method is tested by performing DSMC calculations and comparing the results to those obtained using conventional DSMC chemistry models and experimental data. The macroscopic method gives density profiles in good agreement with experimental data in the chemical relaxation region downstream of a strong shock. Within the shock where strongly non-equilibrium conditions prevail, the macroscopic method provides good agreement with a conventional chemistry model. For the flow over a blunt axisymmetric cylinder, which also exhibits strongly non-equilibrium conditions, the macroscopic method also gives reasonable agreement with conventional chemistry models. The ability of the macroscopic method to utilise any rate expression is demonstrated by using a two-temperature rate model that accounts for dissociation-vibration coupling effects that are important in non-equilibrium reacting flows. Relative to the case without dissociation-vibration coupling, the macroscopic method with the two-temperature model gives reduced dissociation rates in vibrationally cold flows, as expected. Also, for the blunt cylinder flow, the two-temperature model gives reduced surface heat fluxes, as expected. The macroscopic method is also tested with a number density dependent form of the equilibrium constant. For zero-dimensional chemical relaxation, the resulting relaxation histories are in good agreement with those provided by an exact Runge-Kutta solution of the relaxation behaviour. Reviews of basic DSMC procedures and conventional DSMC chemistry models are also given. A method for obtaining the variable hard sphere parameters for collisions between particles of different species is given. Borgnakke-Larsen schemes for modelling internal energy exchange are examined in detail. Both continuous rotational and quantised vibrational energy modes are considered. Detailed derivations of viscosity and collision rate expressions for the generalised hard sphere model of Hassan and Hash [Phys. Fluids 5, 738 (1993)] and the modified version of Macrossan and Lilley [J. Thermophys. Heat Transfer 17, 289 (2003)] are also given.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">291899 Interdisciplinary Engineering not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">780102 Physical sciences</field><field name="subject">DSMC</field><field name="subject">rarefied gas dynamics</field><field name="subject">computational fluid dynamics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158022</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Air-Water Bubbly Flows : Theory and Applications</field><field name="creator">Chanson, Hubert</field><field name="description">In turbulent water flows, large quantities of air bubbles are entrained at the free-surfaces. Practical applications of gas-liquid bubbly flows are found in Chemical, Civil, Environmental, Mechanical, Mining and Nuclear Engineering. Air-water flows are observed in small-scale as well as large-scale flow situations. Typical examples include thin circular jets used as mixing devices in chemical plants (Qw = 0.001 L/s, diameter = 1 mm) and spillway flows (Qw larger than 10,000 m3/s, flow thickness over 10 m). In each case, however, the interactions between the entrained air bubbles and the turbulence field are significant. The present manuscript regroups a collection of one book and 43 articles on the study of air bubble entrainment in turbulent flows. The work aims to gain a better understanding of the basic mechanisms of gas entrainment and the nteractions between entrained gas bubbles and the turbulence. It has been the purpose of the research work to assess critically the overall state of this field, to present new analysis and experimental results, to compare these with existing data, and to present new compelling conclusions regarding momentum and void fraction development of air-water gas-liquid bubbly flows. The manuscript presents a comprehensive analysis of the air entrainment processes in free-surface turbulent flows. The air-water flows are investigated as homogeneous mixtures with variable density. The variations of fluid density result from the non-uniform air bubble distributions and the turbulent diffusion process. Several types of air-water free-surface flows are studied : plunging jet flows, open channel flows, and turbulent water jets discharging into air.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Air-water flows</field><field name="subject">gas-liquid multiphase flows</field><field name="subject">theory</field><field name="subject">applications</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158021</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental Study of Air-Water Flow Properties on Low-Gradient Stepped Cascades</field><field name="creator">Toombes, Luke</field><field name="description">Stepped cascades are recognised for both aeration potential and energy dissipation, and have been employed in hydraulic structures for over 3,500 years. Yet little detailed information exists on their performance, especially pertaining to low-gradient cascades. This study presents a detailed investigation of both the macro and micro-scale flow properties on a low-gradient cascade (3.4&#186; slope). Research is conducted on two large-size physical models: a 24m long multi-step cascade (10&#215; 2.4m long steps), and a single-step model with identical step height and length. The large size of the model allows near full-scale data acquisition under controlled flow conditions, minimising potential scale effects. The study comprises three distinct components: 1. A global investigation of the general flow properties of nappe flow on a low-gradient, multi-step cascade. Unforeseen three-dimensional characteristics of the flow, including supercritical shockwaves and sidewall standing-waves downstream of nappe impact, are identified and examined by the study. Although comparable to similar phenomena at channel bends and expansions, these have not been previously described on stepped cascades. Energy dissipation on the cascade is investigated, and is found to be over twice that observed for a smooth chute of similar gradient. 2. A complete characterisation of the air-water structure of flow in a nappe regime. Significant outcomes of the analysis include: &#8853; Air-concentration Distribution: The air-concentration distribution at the lower nappe of the free-falling jet shows good agreement with an analytical solution of the diffusion equation. The experimental results from the study, and a reanalysis of existing data, indicate a distinct relationship between the turbulent diffusivity in the shear layer and distance from the step brink. This contradicts earlier investigations that assumed constant diffusivity. Strong aeration of the flow, with a large volume of spray, occurs downstream of the nappe impact. Depth-averaged air concentrations of 40% to 50% are observed within the spray region, decreasing towards the downstream end of the step. &#8853; Velocity Distribution: A theoretical analysis of the momentum transfer process imparts an improved understanding of the momentum transfer and velocity redistribution within the free-falling jet. An analytical solution based on twodimensional wake flow is developed, superseding existing solutions based upon a monophase free-mixing layer. &#8853; Bubble-frequency Distribution: A quasi-parabolic relationship between bubble frequency and time-average air concentration across a cross-section is observed. A theoretical explanation for the parabolic relationship is developed, and two correction factors are introduced to provide a better representation of the experimental data. &#8853; Air-bubble and Water-droplet Size Distributions: Chord-length distributions are compared with standard probability distributions, showing good agreement with standard Weibull, gamma and log-normal probability distributions within various regions of the flow on the step. A computer model is developed to model interaction between a bubbly transition from water to air and fluctuations of the free surface. 3. A parallel investigation of the oxygen aeration efficiency of a stepped cascade. Measured air-water property data is used to calculate the air-water interface area in bubbly flow, and to estimate the theoretical aeration efficiency of the stepped cascade based upon the integration of the mass transfer equation. The aeration performance of the stepped cascade model is also measured experimentally in terms of dissolved oxygen content. This analysis allows a unique, successful comparison of experimental dissolved oxygen measurements with the numerical integration of the mass transfer equation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stepped cascades</field><field name="subject">spillways</field><field name="subject">air entrainment</field><field name="subject">air-water mass trasnfer</field><field name="subject">reoxygenation</field><field name="subject">turbulence</field><field name="subject">physcial modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158020</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Experimental Study of Free-surface Aeration on Embankment Stepped Chutes</field><field name="creator">Gonzalez, Carlos A.</field><field name="description">Stepped chutes have been used as hydraulic structures for more than 3.5 millennia for different purposes: For example, to dissipate energy, to enhance aeration rate in the flow and to comply with aesthetical functions. They can be found acting as spillways in dams and weirs, as energy dissipators in artificial channels, gutters and rivers, and as aeration enhancers in water treatment plants and fountains. Spillways are used to prevent dam overtopping caused by floodwaters. Their design has changed through the centuries. In ancient times, some civilizations used steps to dissipate energy in open channels and dam over-falls in a similar fashion as natural cascades. However, in the first half of the twentieth century, the use of concrete became popular and the hydraulic jump was introduced as an efficient energy dissipator. In turn, the use of a stepped geometry became obsolete and was replaced with smooth chutes followed by hydraulic jump stilling basins. In recent years, new construction techniques and materials (Roller Compacted Concrete RCC, rip-rap gabions, wire-meshed gabions, etc.) together with the development of new applications (e.g. re-aeration cascades, fish ladders and embankment overtopping protection or secondary spillways) have allowed cheaper construction of stepped chutes, increasing the interest in stepped chute design. During the last three decades, research in the hydraulics of stepped spillways has been very active. However, studies prior to 1993 neglected the effect of free-surface aeration. A number of studies since this time have focused on air-water flows in steep chutes (&#952; &#8776; 50o). But experimental data is still scarce, and the hydraulic performance of stepped cascades with moderate slope is not yet understood. This study details an experimental investigation of physical air-water flow characteristics down a stepped spillway conducted in two laboratory models with moderate slopes: the first model was a 3.15 m long stepped chute with a 15.9o slope comprising two interchangeable-height steps (h = 0.1 m and h = 0.05 m); the second model was a 2.5 m long, stepped channel with a 21.8o slope comprising 10 steps (h = 0.1 m). Different arrangements of turbulence manipulators (vanes) were also placed throughout the chute in the second model. A broad range of discharges within transition and skimming flow regimes was investigated to obtain a reliable representation of the air-water flow properties. Measurements were conducted using single and double tip conductivity probes at multiple span wise locations and at streamwise distances along the cavity between step edges to obtain a complete three-dimensional representation of the flow. Although the present study was conducted for two moderate slope chutes (&#952; = 15.9&#186; &amp; 21.8o), it is believed that the outcomes are valid for a wider range of chute geometry and flow conditions. The purpose of this study is to improve the understanding of turbulent air-water flows cascading down moderate slope stepped chutes, and gain new understandings of the interactions between aeration rate, flow turbulence and energy dissipation; scale effects are also investigated. The study provides new, original insights into air-water turbulent flows cascading down moderate slope stepped spillways not foreseen in prior studies, thus contributing to improve criterion designs. It also presents an extensive experimental database (available in a CD-ROM attached at the end of this thesis) and a new design criterion that can be used by designers and researchers to improve the operation of stepped chutes with moderate slopes. The present thesis work included a twofold approach. Firstly, the study provided a detailed investigation of the energy dissipative properties of a stepped channel, based upon detailed airwater flow characteristics measurements conducted with sub-millimetric conductivity probes. Secondly, the study focused on the microscopic scale properties of the airwater flow, using the experimental data to quantify the microscopic scale physical processes (e.g. momentum transfer, shear layer development, vertical mixing, airbubbles/ water-droplets break-up and coalescence etc.) that are believed to increase the flow resistance in stepped canals. The study highlighted the tridimensionality of skimming flows and hinted new means of enhancing flow resistance by manipulating turbulence in the stepped chute. Basic dimensional analysis results emphasized that physical modelling of stepped chutes is more sensitive to scale effects than classical smooth-invert chute studies and thus suggested that the extrapolation of results obtained from heavily scaled experimental models should be avoided. The present study also demonstrated that alterations of flow recirculation and fluid exchanges between free-stream and cavity flow affects drastically form losses and in turn the rate of energy dissipation. The introduction of vanes demonstrated simple turbulence manipulation and form drag modification that could lead to more efficient designs in terms of energy rate dissipation without significant structural load on the stepped chute.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stepped spillways</field><field name="subject">air-water turbulent flows</field><field name="subject">energy dissipation</field><field name="subject">recirculating vortices</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158019</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population genetics and mating system in the single remnant and translocated population of the endangered bridled nailtail wallaby, Onychogalea fraenata</field><field name="creator">Sigg, Dominique Patricia</field><field name="description">Many species have suffered severe range contractions as a result of human impacts, and require careful management if they are to persist.

In 1996, a translocated population of bridled nailtail wallabies was established at Idalia National Park, on the western edge of the former range of this species. The aims of this study were to: 1) determine the factors underlying variation in reproductive success among animals released at Idalia; 2) investigate the effects of a range decline on the genetic variation and population structure of the remnant population at Taunton; 3) assess the impact of captive breeding and translocation on the genetic diversity and structure of the established population at Idalia; and 4) investigate male and female mating strategies in this species. Chapter two investigated reproductive success among males released at Idalia National Park. The bridled nailtail wallaby is a sexually dimorphic, polygynous species and there is a large amount of variation in male reproductive success. Animals of different origin were released, including animals bred in captivity off the park, animals bred on-site in enclosures, and wild-caught animals from the remnant population that were moved directly to Idalia. There was significant variation in reproductive success among males released, but the origin of those animals did not explain this variation. Instead, large males were the most reproductively successful regardless of origin. Survival probability and release location were also important factors. This study highlighted the importance of considering mating system when choosing animals for translocation and suggests that, for polygynous species, a greater proportion of females and males of high breeding potential should be released. In Chapter three I investigated the genetic diversity and fine-scale genetic structure of the remnant population at Taunton. This last remaining population has been isolated for at least 60 years, corresponding to 30 generations for this species. Animals are patchily distributed in assemblages of different size that cover ~ 10% of suitable habitat on the park. Genetic diversity was surprisingly high within the population remnant and this species showed one of the highest levels of heterozygosity and allelic diversity of any macropod. The three sub-populations of animals sampled over 10 km were significantly differentiated, and fine-scale spatial genetic structure was also observed within a continuous sub-population of animals covering just 750 ha. Females were more related to each other than expected from random, whereas males were less related to each other than expected. Fine-scale genetic structure was observed among females but not males, providing evidence for female philopatry and male-biased dispersal. I suggest that fine-scale population structure and restricted gene flow among females but not males may maintain genetic diversity in this remnant population. Chapter four assessed the effect of translocation of animals of different origin on genetic diversity in bridled nailtail wallabies. Both wild-caught and captive-bred animals were initially released, but subsequent releases consisted of captive-bred animals only. In this study, I compared genetic diversity of released animals to animals sampled in the remnant population. Heterozygosity did not differ between the remnant and translocated population, however allelic diversity was significantly reduced among all groups released. Animals bred in captivity were significantly differentiated from the source population, whereas animals moved directly from Taunton were not. Releasing more captive-bred animals into the population after the initial release resulted in a decline in overall heterozygosity and allelic diversity. This study highlights the importance of sourcing animals directly from remnant populations in order to maintain genetic diversity and minimize genetic drift between source and recipient populations. The bridled nailtail wallaby has a polygynous mating system and reproductive success is skewed toward large males. However unlike most polygynous, sexually dimorphic macropods, the bridled nailtail wallaby is highly solitary; animals only associate to breed and males do not form stable dominance hierarchies. In Chapter five I investigated behavioural strategies used by males to secure matings, and mate choice among females. I found that males of different size adopted different mating strategies. Large males spent more time guarding females against other males and maintaining contact with them, whereas smaller males spent less time with guarded females in order to search for other females in oestrus. Females also preferred larger males and were more likely to engage in mate chases if there was a large number of males within the group.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">population genetics</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">translocation</field><field name="subject">mating system</field><field name="subject">reproductive success</field><field name="subject">mammal</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158018</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of Common Impurity Elements on Grain Refinement of Magnesium Alloys</field><field name="creator">Cao, Peng</field><field name="description">There has been much confusion evident in the literature in terms of the influence of impurity elements on grain refinement of magnesium alloys. This thesis addresses how impurity elements such as iron, manganese, carbon and beryllium affect grain refinement in magnesium alloys. The thesis starts with an investigation into the effect of the uptake of iron on grain refinement of Mg-Zr alloys. The highly detrimental influence of the uptake of iron on grain refinement in Mg-Zr alloys has been confirmed. The gradual loss of grain refinement of Mg-Zr alloys partly arises from the consumption of Zr by the formation of Fe2Zr via the reaction between soluble Zr and Fe picked up from mild steel crucibles. (Settling of undissolved Zr particles also partly attributes to the gradual loss of grain refinement.) The morphological evolution of Zr-rich cores from circular to rosette-like has been reported here for the first time. In contrast to the detrimental effect in Mg-Zr alloys, a positive effect of iron has been observed in grain refinement of Mg-Al based alloys. The addition of iron in the form of anhydrous FeCl3 produces significant grain refinement of high-purity Mg-Al alloys. Obvious grain refinement was also achieved through the uptake of iron from steel crucible surfaces; however, the addition of Fe powder in the form of an ALTABTM Fe75 powder compact (75%Fe, 15%Al and 10% Na-free flux) did not give rise to grain refinement. The results obtained from both the grain refinement tests conducted in aluminium titanite crucibles and an ultra-low carbon 316L stainless crucible indicate that the grain refinement of Mg-Al alloys by iron inoculation has little to do with the Al4C3 hypothesis. The nucleant particles have been clarified to be Fe- and Al-rich intermetallics. The effect of manganese on the grain refinement of high purity Mg-Al based alloys and commercially available AZ31 alloys has been investigated using an Al-60%Mn master alloy splatter at 730 &#132;aC in aluminium titanite crucibles. Grain refinement was readily achievable in these alloys. Electron microprobe analyses revealed that prior to the addition of extra manganese the majority of the intermetallic particles found in AZ31 are of the Al8Mn5 type. However, after the addition of extra manganese in the range of 0.1% to 1.0%, the predominant group of intermetallic particles changed to the metastable AlMn type. This leads to a hypothesis that the metastable AlMn intermetallic particles are more effective than Al8Mn5 as nucleation sites for magnesium grains. The hypothesis was supported by the observation that a long period of holding at 730 &#132;aC led to an increase in grain size, due probably to the transformation of the metastable AlMn to the stable Al8Mn5. Native grain refinement in magnesium alloys has been clarified. Based on the fact that native grain refinement is an exclusive feature of high purity Mg-Al alloys, it is hypothesized that Al4C3 particles act as nucleation centres. This is also the mechanism of carbon grain refinement of Mg-Al alloys. A trace of beryllium leads to dramatic grain coarsening in Mg-Al alloys at normal cooling rates. Apart from Mg-Al alloys, a trace of beryllium also causes considerable grain coarsening in Mg-Zn, Mg-Ca, Mg-Ce, Mg-Nd and also hinders grain refinement of magnesium alloys by Zr. Modelling grain refinement to predict the final grain size has been made on the basis of understanding of existing models. The modified model has resolved a fundamental gap in the relative grain size model using a more universal expression of solute concentration in the liquid.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Magnesium</field><field name="subject">Grain refinement</field><field name="subject">Impurity</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158017</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pulse Transit Time as a Tool in the Diagnosis of Paediatric Sleep Related Breathing Disorders</field><field name="creator">Foo, Jong Yong Abdiel</field><field name="description">Sleep related breathing disorders in childhood are increasingly recognised as contributors to morbidity as well as suboptimal physical, mental and social development. The associated cost in social and economic terms is clearly significant. Detection and diagnosis of such disorders can be costly and technically difficult. Multi-parameter monitoring like polysomnography is expensive and inappropriate for mass screening or investigations remote from tertiary centres. A simple and non-invasive cardiovascular approach termed pulse transit time (PTT) is useful in determining the status of upper airways during sleep. This approach employs the measurement of the time delay in the arterial pulse pressure wave from the aortic valve of the heart to a peripheral site. PTT has shown promise to provide quantify inspiratory effort in adults with sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and can then be an effective monitoring tool in children. Initial investigations explore the parameters that can confound the PTT measurements of a child. This work provides an estimate of the expected PTT ranges from infancy to childhood. Thereafter, overnight PTT recordings were performed in conjunction with PSG studies to corroborate evidence for its capability in paediatric respiratory studies. The results show that PTT has the ability to identify abnormal respiratory events during sleep. Furthermore, the use of PTT can differentiate the nature of respiratory events as obstructive or central. Technological considerations to improve the robustness of PTT measure to be used not only in cardiorespiratory but also cardiovascular studies on children were also illustrated. Preliminary findings obtained here suggest that the properties of PTT show promise as a predictor for obstructive sleep apnoea. There is a need to bridge the gap of providing quality SDB diagnosis and yet accommodating requirements for a robust screening measure. PTT has demonstrated its suitability and utility as a measure to play a role in the investigation and monitoring of treatment in this area.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pulse transit time</field><field name="subject">sleep apnoea</field><field name="subject">respiratory sleep studies</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158016</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Secularising the Veil: A Study of Legal and Cultural Issues Arising from the Wearing of the Islamic Headscarf in the 'affaire du foulard' in France.</field><field name="creator">Jones, Pamela Nicolette (Nicky) Louise</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a study of the institutions, forms and manifestations of secularism, or 'la&#239;cit&#233;', in France, in the context of a series of events which came to be called the 'affaire du foulard'. The first incidents in the affaire took place in September 1989 with the expulsion of three primary schoolgirls in Creil, in the north of France, who were insisting on wearing the Islamic headscarf (known in French as the 'foulard') to school. Their actions were deemed contrary to the fundamental Republican principle of secularism in public schools, and the events were reported in several newspapers, before becoming a national controversy in media around the country. In this case, however, it was difficult to know how to interpret and apply la&#239;cit&#233; in the context of a modern public school in the French Republic. The principle of secularism, or la&#239;cit&#233;, is a central tenet of French public policy, and public education in particular. La&#239;cit&#233; also represents a set of social and cultural values which have profound historical resonances for many French people. At the same time, the public schools were unsure of how to negotiate their students&#146; freedom of religious expression, which, according to historical and legislative texts, is protected and upheld by the concept of la&#239;cit&#233;, while also ensuring that the principle of la&#239;cit&#233; was maintained. In a bid to resolve the uncertainty, France&#146;s highest administrative court, the Conseil d&#146;&#201;tat, handed down a legal opinion in November 1989 in which it stated that the wearing of religious signs in public schools was not by itself incompatible with la&#239;cit&#233; in France, although the religious signs could be prohibited in certain circumstances. In addition, various ministerial circulars were issued by successive Education Ministers between 1989 and 1994 to advise schools on how the law was to be interpreted and applied in this matter. One of the circulars, issued in 1994 by Fran&#231;ois Bayrou, encouraged schools to prohibit the wearing of the foulard and to apply strict penalties if Muslim girls continued to wear it. These measures resulted in an increase in the number of Muslim schoolgirls expelled for wearing the foulard, as well as in the numbers of public protests against the expulsions and the circular itself. Some of the schoolgirls and their families appealed against the expulsion decisions, and their cases appeared before France&#146;s administrative courts over the years between 1992 and 1997. My thesis examines the key legal and administrative texts in the affaire du foulard, including the Conseil d&#146;&#201;tat&#146;s 1989 legal opinion and the ministerial circulars, noting the legal implications of successive circulars and the shifts in government policy which they represented. In addition, my thesis analyses the transcripts of many of the legal judgements in the &#147;headscarf&#148; legal cases. These judgements were important not only in deciding the future education of the schoolgirls, but also in clarifying the 1989 opinion. They established a consistent set of principles to define the circumstances in which wearing religious signs such as the foulard was considered compatible or not with la&#239;cit&#233; in public schools. The results of this analysis indicate that, contrary to popular opinion in relation to the affaire du foulard, the majority of cases were decided in the Muslim girls&#146; favour and upheld their right to wear a religious sign such as the Islamic headscarf at school. Recently, however, the legal regime in France governing the wearing of religious signs has changed. In early 2004, a new law on secularism was passed by the French Parliament to prohibit the wearing of the foulard (and indeed all visible religious signs) in public schools. The law has been welcomed by many sectors of the French community, but has also provoked extensive public protests. The passage of the new law does not alter either the analytical work or the conclusions of this thesis. Rather, the thesis offers an insight into the background of the affaire du foulard and thus a more informed appreciation of the potential legal and social consequences of the 2004 law in future years. The principal aim of this thesis is to provide a careful account of the institutions and operation of the principle of secularism, or la&#239;cit&#233;, in France. My research also explains some of the complexities of the legislative regime established by the Conseil d&#146;&#201;tat and the administrative courts, who worked to balance priorities of freedom of religion and la&#239;cit&#233; as well as to protect the education of many expelled Muslim schoolgirls, and in so doing, my thesis highlights the complexity of the principle of la&#239;cit&#233; itself.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">390305 Law and Society</field><field name="subject">780106 Political science and public policy</field><field name="subject">Secular</field><field name="subject">secularism</field><field name="subject">la&#239;cit&#233;</field><field name="subject">France</field><field name="subject">Islamic</field><field name="subject">veil</field><field name="subject">headscarf</field><field name="subject">hijab</field><field name="subject">foulard</field><field name="subject">affaire du foulard</field><field name="subject">secularism law</field><field name="subject">separation of Church and State</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158015</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Silica Sol Gel Bulk Gelation in Various Gravity Regimes</field><field name="creator">Pienaar, Christine Louise</field><field name="description">Nanomaterials are currently attracting billions of dollars in research funding and are entering such diverse fields as the computing, communications, life science and energy sectors. The growing popularity of nanomaterials demands a comprehensive understanding of the means by which such materials can be produced including the effects of physical and chemical factors. One method of forming inorganic nanomaterials is the sol-gel process; a low temperature process combining the benefits of glass and plastics technology. Whilst the research community has ascertained that gravity is important and appears to affect the sol-gel process, no coherent picture of the role of gravity on the sol-gel process has been proposed. The flexibility of the sol-gel process, and the promise it holds for creating products as diverse as hydrogen fuel cell membranes through to protective coatings for space vehicles, make it an important area of study. This thesis addressed a fundamental gap in the scientific knowledge concerned with the sol-gel process: how and why does gravity affect the sol-gel process? The nanomaterial chosen for study was a xerogel, a dense compound with a high surface area which finds applications in high temperature ceramics, energy saving coatings, molecular filtration and thin film sensors. The xerogel was produced from an acid catalysed sol. 2ml samples of the sol were subjected to reduced, normal and high gravity levels, and the resultant xerogels were characterised through liquid and solid state NMR and nitrogen adsorption/desorption techniques. Viscosity and pH measurements were also recorded. Reduced gravity conditions were provided by NASA&#146;s KC-135 aircraft which is capable of creating a 25 second window of 1x10&#8722;2 gravities. A centrifuge was utilised to simulate increased gravity environments and xerogels were formed between 2 and 70 gravities. Analysis of the results led to two major contributions to this field of scientific endeavour. It was concluded that (1) gravity affected the reaction pathways of the sol-gel process and (2) gravity directly altered the molecular structure of xerogels The second contribution was determined through the NMR studies, where it was shown that a reduction in gravity resulted in a molecular structure composed of extended branches of cyclic compounds. Due to a decrease in convection in reduced gravity the molecular structure of the sample was dominated by cyclisation. In terrestrial and high gravity the molecular structure grew through both bimolecularisation and cyclisation reactions. Thus the gravity level also determined the reaction pathway available within the sol by creating a more or less convective environment. This created a structure composed of cyclics (rings) and chains. As gelation and drying of the sol occurred there was a loss in Q4 group amount. Chains, having a higher energy configuration than rings, underwent repolymerisation. Short chains formed which reacted end-to-end to form small, stable rings. The rings packed together more closely within the liquid sol and delayed the formation of a spanning cluster. The greater the gravity level, the greater the extent of bimolecularisation reactions contributing to chain formation, in turn allowing a greater degree of repolymerisation of the molecular structure. Thus gel times increased as the gravity level increased. Again gravity directly affected the reaction pathway of the sol-gel process. In reduced gravity the sol gelled very quickly due to the formation of a cyclic structure which was not capable of repolymerisation. The final contribution of this thesis was the proposal of a mechanistic model. The model depicted the ffect of gravity on the formation of the molecular structure of a xerogel.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reduced gravity</field><field name="subject">sol-gel</field><field name="subject">evaporation</field><field name="subject">gelation</field><field name="subject">xerogel</field><field name="subject">gravity</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158014</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ectoparasites and Stress Physiology of Coral Trout Plectropomus leopardus (Lacep&#232;de, 1802)</field><field name="creator">Turner, Tracey Brooke</field><field name="description">The common coral trout Plectropomus leopardus (Lacep&#232;de, 1802) is an important commercially and recreationally fished species in Australia. This thesis examined a number of factors that may affect the suitability of this species for aquaculture including ectoparasite fauna and stress physiology. Examination of the ectoparasite fauna of P. leopardus revealed one new species, Hatschekia (Species A), and new host records for the copepods Peniculisa bellwoodi and Sagum epinepheli. Other ectoparasites recorded included Dissonus manteri, Hatschekia plectropomi, Lepeophtheirus plectropomi, Dentigryps litus, Trochopus plectropomi, Diplectanum plectropomi, Aega lethrina, Argathona macronema and turbellarians. There were significant differences between the ectoparasite communities of P. leopardus from Heron Island Reef and a population from the Cairns region of the Great Barrier Reef with absence of some parasites from certain sites and variations in the intensity of infection of other parasites. Dissonus manteri, H. plectropomi and P. bellwoodi were associated with the most severe pathology as determined by gross examination, histology, scanning electron microscopy and vascular casting techniques. This pathology was considered unlikely to cause a significant threat to host fish survival at the infection intensities observed on wild fish. This hypothesis was supported by the observation that levels of ectoparasite infection of wild fish were insufficient to initiate a stress response, as determined by blood parameter analysis. Detailed examination of the distribution of H. plectropomi on the gills of P. leopardus revealed a site preference for holobranchs 2 and 3. Filaments near the ends of gill arches and those around the bend in the gill arch were rarely occupied. The chance of coming into contact with a suitable attachment site along with the ability to withstand ventilation forces at that site may be the major factors affecting the distribution of this species. Two H. plectropomi morphotypes were identified based on the direction of body curvature. Regardless of morphotype, 98% of individuals were attached such that the convex side of the body was oriented towards the oncoming ventilating water currents. Further, 94% of individuals attached to the posterior faces of filaments leading to a predictable pattern of attachment for this species. Baseline concentrations of 12 blood parameters were determined for 30 fish species representing 12 families from Heron Island Reef, Great Barrier Reef, including P. leopardus (Serranidae), in addition to one estuarine species, the fork-tailed catfish Arius graeffei Kner &amp; Steindachner, 1867 (Ariidae), from the Brisbane River. Baseline physiological status was determined via rapid blood sampling via caudal puncture of wild caught fish and analysis of a range of blood parameters. The validity of this method was evaluated via analysis of blood samples taken from hussar Lutjanus adetii (Castelnau, 1873). There were no significant changes in any of the measured blood parameters during the first two minutes following a stressful stimulus supporting the use of rapid blood sampling for baseline blood parameter determination. The measured baseline values provided a basis for comparison of post-stress values with differences between species in baseline and post-stress physiological condition discussed in relation to differences in lifestyle such as activity level and diet. Examination of the response of coral trout to hook-and-line capture over a 3-day period revealed an initial elevation of cortisol from a median baseline concentration of 0.40 nM (n = 17) to a peak of 19.01 nM (n = 7) 2 h post-hooking. Plasma osmolality, glucose and lactate also rose significantly and all parameters had returned to near baseline levels within 24 h of capture. Cortisol, glucose and lactate were identified as the best indicators of acute physiological disturbance in P. leopardus. Cortisol, glucose, lactate, osmolality and haematocrit were the best indicators of acute physiological stress in A. graeffei. An acute temperature increase of approximately 5oC over a period of 15 minutes was stressful to P. leopardus as indicated by an elevation of plasma cortisol. In contrast, an acute temperature drop did not have any significant effect on the physiological parameters measured. In an acute handling and air exposure experiment fish were rapidly hand-netted from holding tanks, subjected to a period of air exposure (0, 2, 4 or 6 minutes) and returned to the water for two hours prior to being blood sampled. Air exposure time did not significantly affect the resultant physiological parameters, suggesting that netting and transfer was the most stressful part of the experimental protocol. The potential commercial applications of these findings are discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stress physiology</field><field name="subject">ectoparasite</field><field name="subject">fish</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158012</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predicting Woodland Bird Response to Livestock Grazing</field><field name="creator">Martin, Tara Gentle</field><field name="description">Livestock grazing impacts more land than any other use. Yet knowledge of grazing impacts on native fauna is scarce. This thesis takes a predictive approach to investigating the effects of livestock grazing on Australian woodland birds, employing some novel methodological approaches and experimental designs. These include methods of analysis to handle zero-inflated data and the application of Bayesian statistics to analyse predictions based on expert opinion. The experimental designs have enabled impacts of grazing to be separated from the frequently confounding effects of other disturbances, and to consider the effect of grazing on habitat condition in the context of different surrounding land uses. A distinguishing feature of many datasets is their tendency to contain a large proportion of zero values. It can be difficult to extract ecological relationships from these datasets if we do not consider how these zeros arose and how to model them. Recent developments in modelling zero-inflated data are tested with the aim of making such methods more accessible to mainstream ecology. Through practical examples, we demonstrate how not accounting for zero-inflation can reduce our ability to detect relationships in ecological data and at worst lead to incorrect inference. The impact of grazing on birds was first examined through the elicitation of a priori predictions from 20 Australian ecologists. This expert knowledge was then used to inform a statistical model using Bayesian methods. The addition of expert data through priors in our model strengthened results under at least one grazing level for all but one bird species examined. This study highlights that in fields where there is extensive expert knowledge, yet little published data, the use of expert information as priors for ecological models is a cost effective way of making more confident predictions about the effect of management on biodiversity. A second set of a priori predictions were formulated using a mechanistic approach. Habitat structure is a major determinant of bird species diversity and livestock grazing is one mechanism by which structure is altered. Using available information on the vegetation strata utilised by each species for foraging and the strata most affected by grazing, predictions of the impact of grazing on each bird species were formulated. We found that foraging height preference was a good predictor of species&#146; susceptibility to grazing. This approach is a starting point for more complex predictive models, and avoids the circularity of post hoc interpretation of impact data. The confounding of grazing with tree clearing was addressed by examining the impact of pastoral management on birds in sub-tropical grassy eucalypt woodland in Southeast Queensland, where land management practices have made it possible to disentangle these effects. Changes in bird species indices were recorded across woodland and riparian habitats with and without trees across three levels of grazing, replicated over space and time. Tree removal had a dramatic influence on 78% of the bird fauna. 65% of species responded significantly to changes in grazing level and the abundance of 42% of species varied significantly with habitat, level of clearing and grazing. The impact of grazing on birds was most severe in riparian habitat. Finally, the extent to which landscape context and local habitat characteristics influence bird assemblages of riparian habitats in grazed landscapes is addressed. Over 80% of bird species responded significantly to changes in local riparian habitat characteristics regardless of context, while over 50% of species were significantly influenced by landscape context. The influence of landscape context increased as the surrounding landuse became more intensive. These results suggest that it is not enough to conserve riparian habitats alone but conservation and restoration plans must consider landscape context. The ability to predict which bird species will be most affected by grazing will facilitate the transformation of this industry into one that is both profitable and ecologically sustainable. Results from this thesis suggest that any level of commercial grazing is detrimental to some woodland birds. Habitats with high levels of grazing support a species-poor bird assemblage dominated by birds that are increasing nationally. However, provided trees are not cleared and landscape context is not intensively used, a rich and abundant bird fauna can coexist with moderate levels of grazing, including iconic woodland birds which are declining elsewhere in Australia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bayesian modelling</field><field name="subject">zero-inflated Poisson</field><field name="subject">cattle grazing</field><field name="subject">vegetation structure</field><field name="subject">bird species composition</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158011</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Political Economy of the Music Industry: Technological Change and the Political Control of Music</field><field name="creator">Cvetkovski, Trajce</field><field name="description">The task undertaken in this dissertation is to determine the extent of the challenge facing the major firms (majors) who currently control over 80% of global sound carrier and publishing revenue in the popular (pop) music industry. The aim of this thesis is to explain the disorganising effects currently being experienced. Specifically, the central question guiding this thesis asks: what will be the effect of new technologies on the future organisation of the music industry? I focus broadly on recent universally accessible digital technologies which have raised questions about the future of the industry&#146;s current organisational structure and processes both in terms of input (creation of music products in their commodified form) and output (access and consumption of music products). The industry&#146;s processes are highly integrated and its business model is complex because it centres around the sophisticated management and aggressive appropriation of intellectual property (namely copyright) for repeated exploitation for decades after its initial acquisition. The purpose of this research, therefore, is to examine not only the tangible aspects of the manner in which the industry&#146;s organises its products but also the intangible dimension. Significant recent changes experienced by the industry are identified. The literature is not conclusive in terms of explaining these developments. While existing research exists on recent developments, a comprehensive analysis of the organisation of the industry both in terms of input and output remains underdeveloped in the literature. In particular, in relation to product re-organisation and consumer behaviour, copyright development and corporate restructuring, the literature is not fully developed. Current research is focused on illegitimate technological attacks &#150; namely digital piracy. However these do not adequately or comprehensively explain current disorganisation in the industry. This dissertation remedies this deficiency by proposing four separate but interconnected factors are affecting the highly concentrated status quo. Together, the positive and negative impacts of emerging technologies have created a serious dilemma in terms of product commodification for the controllers of the industry. I argue interconnected illegitimate and legitimate technological challenges are at play suggesting re-organisation is occurring multidimensionally. The research undertaken is empirically grounded, and though primarily based on qualitative data (and subsequent quantitative data for statistical corroboration), the current work has implications for understanding the industry&#146;s methods. Together, these approaches form the basis of the dissertation&#146;s methodology. The research reported in this dissertation attempts to determine to what extent the use and consumption of these different technologies can be regarded as the primary catalyst for the challenge to corporate control of the music industry, and the manner in which it is structured. If the dominant few intend to identify and rationalise challenges in terms of their corporate model, then they must understand the dynamic nature of interacting technologies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">popular music</field><field name="subject">copyright</field><field name="subject">internet</field><field name="subject">technology</field><field name="subject">creative industries</field><field name="subject">MP3</field><field name="subject">pop culture</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">First-principles quantum simulations of many-mode open interacting Bose gases using stochastic gauge methods</field><field name="creator">Deuar, Piotr Pawel</field><field name="description">The quantum dynamics and grand canonical thermodynamics of many-mode (one-, two-, and three-dimensional) interacting Bose gases are simulated from first principles. The model uses a lattice Hamiltonian based on a continuum second-quantized model with two-particle interactions, external potential, and interactions with an environment, with no further approximations. The interparticle potential can be either an (effective) delta function as in Bose-Hubbard models, or extended with a shape resolved by the lattice. Simulations are of a set of stochastic equations that in the limit of many realizations correspond exactly to the full quantum evolution of the many-body systems. These equations describe the evolution of samples of the gauge P distribution of the quantum state, details of which are developed. Conditions under which general quantum phase-space representations can be used to derive stochastic simulation methods are investigated in detail, given the criteria: 1) The simulation corresponds exactly to quantum mechanics in the limit of many trajectories. 2) The number of equations scales linearly with system size, to allow the possibility of efficient first-principles quantum mesoscopic simulations. 3) All observables can be calculated from one simulation. 4) Each stochastic realization is independent to allow straightforward use of parallel algorithms. Special emphasis is placed on allowing for simulation of open systems. In contrast to typical Monte Carlo techniques based on path integrals, the phase-space representation approach can also be used for dynamical calculations. Two major (and related) known technical stumbling blocks with such stochastic simulations are instabilities in the stochastic equations, and pathological trajectory distributions as the boundaries of phase space are approached. These can (and often do) lead to systematic biases in the calculated observables. The nature of these problems are investigated in detail. Many phase-space distributions have, however, more phase-space freedoms than the minimum required for exact correspondence to quantum mechanics, and these freedoms can in many cases be exploited to overcome the instability and boundary term problems, recovering an unbiased simulation. The stochastic gauge technique, which achieves this in a systematic way, is derived and heuristic guidelines for its use are developed. The gauge P representation is an extension of the positive P distribution, which uses coherent basis states, but allows a variety of useful stochastic gauges that are used to overcome the stability problems. Its properties are investigated, and the resulting equations to be simulated for the open interacting Bose gas system are derived. The dynamics of the following many-mode systems are simulated as examples: 1) Uniform one-dimensional and two-dimensional Bose gases after the rapid appearance of significant two-body collisions (e.g. after entering a Feshbach resonance). 2) Trapped bosons, where the size of the trap is of the same order as the range of the interparticle potential. 3) Stimulated Bose enhancement of scattered atom modes during the collision of two Bose-Einstein condensates. The grand canonical thermodynamics of uniform one-dimensional Bose gases is also calculated for a variety of temperatures and collision strengths. Observables calculated include first to third order spatial correlation functions (including at finite interparticle separation) and momentum distributions. The predicted phenomena are discussed. Improvements over the positive P distribution and other methods are discussed, and simulation times are analyzed for Bose-Hubbard lattice models from a general perspective. To understand the behavior of the equations, and subsequently optimize the gauges for the interacting Bose gas, single- and coupled two-mode dynamical and thermodynamical models of interacting Bose gases are investigated in detail. Directions in which future progress can be expected are considered. Lastly, safeguards are necessary to avoid biased averages when exponentials of Gaussian-like trajectory distributions are used (as here), and these are investigated.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">249999 Physical Sciences not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">780102 Physical sciences</field><field name="subject">Bose-Einstein condensate</field><field name="subject">quantum mechanics</field><field name="subject">stochastic methods</field><field name="subject">positive P representation</field><field name="subject">Bose gas</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular Interactions of Munc18cand GLUT4-associated SNARE proteins</field><field name="creator">Latham, Catherine Frances Mary</field><field name="description">The focus of this thesis is to characterise the interactions between GLUT4-related SNARE proteins &#150; syntaxin4, SNAP23 and VAMP2 &#150; and a regulatory protein, Munc18c. GLUT4 is the primary insulin-regulated glucose transporter and is presentin fat and muscle cells. GLUT4 is held in intracellular pools of vesicles until it is transported to the cell surface upon insulin stimulation. Insulin initiates a cellular signalling cascade via the insulin receptor on the cell membrane, which in turn stimulates GLUT4 vesicles to move to the cell surface where they fuse to the plasmamembrane via SNARE proteins. SNAREs are membrane-anchored proteins present on both vesicle and target membranes that form a tight complex which brings themembranes together for fusion. Fusion of vesicles to the target membrane releases the vesicular cargo.SNARE-mediated membrane fusion is a conserved mechanism that controls many other vesicle fusion processes such as neurotransmitter release and yeast vesicular trafficking. However, the regulation of the SNARE mechanism is not fully understood. SNAREs can interact with many other proteins that could act as regulatory factors,and studies have focused primarily on a group of effector proteins called Sec1p/Munc18 (SM) proteins. SM proteins were discovered and characterised because they bind to one type of SNARE protein, syntaxin. The SM protein that interacts with the GLUT4-related SNARE, syntaxin4, is Munc18c.The aim of this thesis was to investigate Munc18c interactions with SNARE proteins, principally syntaxin4, using biochemical techniques with purified recombinant proteins. This work was carried out in several stages including: 1) development of methods to produce and purify GLUT4-related SNARE proteins, SNARE complexes and Munc18c, 2) development of an assay to quantify Munc18c interactions with binding partners using surface plasmon resonance, 3) investigation into interactions between Munc18c and SNARE ternary complex, 4) characterising Munc18c interactions with syntaxin4, and 5) developing a method to produce selenomethionine-containing Munc18c in a baculovirus system to be used in structural studies. The methods and outcomes of these experiments are described inthis thesis. There were two major outcomes from this work. Firstly, Munc18c interacts with SNARE ternary complex, and secondly, Munc18c requires only the N-terminal 29residues of syntaxin4 for an interaction to occur. These results were determined using pulldown assays with purified proteins, as well as other chromatographic methods to show that protein complexes were formed. The steps taken to develop these binding assays are also discussed. Initial crystallisation conditions forMunc18c-HIS and a peptide consisting of syntaxin4 residues 1-20 have been identified using crystallisation screens. The interactions determined for Munc18c binding to Sx4 are in direct contrast to those of neuronal SM protein, Munc18a, and its interaction with neuronal SNARE proteins - Munc18a does not bind to its ternary complex and binds to the entire cytoplasmic domain of Sx1a. Rather, the Munc18c:Sx4 interactions are similar to that for the yeast SM protein, Sly1p, which can interact with both its SNARE ternary complex and with its syntaxin via the Nterminal residues. Another interesting outcome of this research was that syntaxin4 binds to metals (cobalt and nickel). This finding represents the first reported for a syntaxin interacting with metals. Preliminary results indicate that un-tagged syntaxin4 can bind to cobalt resin, and to nickel immobilised on a chip. This interesting and novel property of syntaxin4 binding was serendipitously discovered while investigating conditions for the Munc18c assay. Overall, I have shown that Munc18c, the SM protein involved in GLUT4 trafficking, interacts with SNARE proteins in a different manner to its mammalian counterpart inneurons, Munc18a, and is more like Sly1p, a yeast ER-Golgi SM protein. Munc18c interacts with SNARE complexes and only the N-terminal residues of syntaxin4.These interactions demonstrate that the regulatory mechanism for SNARE-mediated fusion is conserved between yeast and mammals. This finding has several implications for the role of Munc18c in the exocytosis of GLUT4-containing vesicles. Munc18c could act at several stages in the fusion process via syntaxin4 binding.These interactions could involve binding to other proteins (such as synip or tomosyn), conformational switching of syntaxin4 or interaction with metal ions to induce conformational changes in the proteins. Finally, these studies of GLUT4 exocytosis contribute to our understanding of glucose transport disorders such as Type 2 diabetes and could one day pave the way for the design of therapeutic agents.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">exocytosis</field><field name="subject">glucose</field><field name="subject">GLUT4</field><field name="subject">SNARE</field><field name="subject">pulldown</field><field name="subject">protein-protein interactions</field><field name="subject">biacore</field><field name="subject">crystallisation</field><field name="subject">Munc18c</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Complex Co-evolutionary Systems Approach to the Management of Sustainable Grasslands - A case study in Mexico.</field><field name="creator">Martinez-Garcia, Alejandro Nicolas</field><field name="description">The complex co-evolutionary systems approach -CCeSA - provides a well-suited framework for analysing agricultural systems, serving as a bridge between physical and socioeconomic sciences, alowing for the explaination of phenomena, and for the use of metaphors for thinking and action. By studying agricultural systems as self-generated, hierarchical, complex co-evolutionary farming systems - CCeFSs -, one can investigate the interconnections between the elements that constitute CCeFSs, along with the relationships between CCeFSs and other sytems, as a fundamental step to understanding sustainability as an emergent property of the system. CCeFSs are defined as human activity systems emerging from the purposes, gestalt, mental models, history and weltanschauung of the farm manager, and from his dynamic co-evolution with the environment while managing the resources at his hand to achieve his own multiple, conflicting, dynamic, semi-structured, and often incommensurable and conflicting purposes while performing above thresholds for failure, and enough flexibility to dynamically co-evolve with its changing biophysical and socioeconomic environment for a given future period. Fitness and flexibility are essential features of sustainable CCeFSs because they describe the systems' dynamic capacity to explore and exploit their dynamic phase space while co-evolving with it. This implies that a sustainable CCeFS is conceived as a set of dynamic, co-evolutionary processes, contrasting with the standard view of sustainability as an equilibrium or steady-state. Achieving sustainable CCeFSs is a semi-structured, constrained, multi-objective and dynamic optimisation management problem, with an intractable search space, that can be solved within CCeSA with the help of a multi-objective co-evolutionary optimisation tool. Carnico-ICSPEA2, a co-evolutionary navigator - CoEvoNav -used as a CCeSA's tool for harnessing the complexity of the CCeFS of interest and its environment towards sustainability, is introduced. The software was designed by its end-user - the farm manager and author of this thesis - as an aid for the analysis and optimisation of the San Francisco ranch, a beef cattle enterprise running on temperate pastures and fodder crops in the Central Plateau of Mexico. By combining a non-linear simulator and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with a deterministic and stochastic framework, the CoEvoNav imitates the co-evolutionary pattern of the CCeFS of interest. As such, the software was used by the farm manager to navigate through his CCeFS's co-evolutionary phase space towards achieving sustainability at farm level. The ultimate goal was to enhance the farm manager's decision-making process and co-evolutionary skills, through an increased understanding of his system, the co-evolutionary process between his mental models, the CCeFS, and the CoEvoNav, and the continuous discovery of new, improved sets of heuristics. An overview of the methodological, theoretical and philosophical framework of the thesis is introduced. Also, a survey of the Mexican economy, its agricultural sector, and a statistical review of the Mexican beef industry is presented. Concepts such as modern agriculture, the reductionist approach to agricultural research, models, the system's environment, sustainability, conventional and sustainable agriculture, complexity, evolution, simulators, and multi-objective optimisation tools are extensively reviewed. Issues concerning the impossibility of predicting the long-term future behaviour of CCeFSs, along with the use of simulators as decision support tools in the quest for sustainable CCeFSs are discussed. The rationale behind the simulator used for this study, along with that of the multi-objective evolutionary tools used as a makeup of Carnico-ICSPEA2 are explained. A description of the San Francisco ranch, its key on-farm sustainability indicators in the form of objective functions, constraints, and decision variables, and the semi-structured, multi-objective, dynamic, constrained management problem posed by the farm manager's planned introduction of a herd of bulls for fattening as a way to increase the fitness of his CCeFS via a better management of the system's feed surpluses and the acquisition of a new pick-up truck are described as a case study. The tested scenario and the experimental design for the simulations are presented as well. Results from using the CoEvoNav as the farm manager's extended phenotype to solve his multi-objective optimisation problem are described, along with the implications for the management and sustainability of the CCeFS. Finally, the approach and tools developed are evaluated, and the progress made in relation to methodological, theoretical, philosophical and conceptual notions is reviewed along with some future topics for research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">230118 Optimisation</field><field name="subject">300901 Farm Management, Rural Management and Agribusiness</field><field name="subject">300903 Sustainable Development</field><field name="subject">complexity</field><field name="subject">sustainability</field><field name="subject">co-evolution</field><field name="subject">multi-objective optimisation</field><field name="subject">multi-objective evolutionary algorithms</field><field name="subject">farming systems management</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Health Communication : An Intergroup Perspective</field><field name="creator">Watson, Bernadette Maria.</field><field name="description">The aim of this project was to examine which factors are important in influencing communication between health professionals and patients. Communication Accommodation Theory (CAT) was the theoretical framework adopted in this project. CAT proposes that individuals are influenced by their personal and social identities and that, in many cases, it is an individual's group or social identity that is most salient in an interaction. The underlying theoretical assumption in this project was that communication between health professionals and patients is characterised by intergroup rather than interpersonal salience and convergent methodologies were used to test this proposition. In addition to CAT, the linguistic category model (LCM), which is also used to investigate individuals' perceptions of intergroup salience, was adopted to complement the findings derived from CAT. There were seven studies in this project. The first study described the methodology for obtaining the data set used in Part 1 of the thesis. Participants wrote retrospective descriptions of a satisfactory and unsatisfactory conversation with a hospital staff member which they had experienced as a hospital in-patient. Study 1 provided a profile of the participants. In Study 2 the stimuli were participants' written recollections of 69 unsatisfactory and 79 satisfactory conversations. The LCM was used to test for differences in participants' perceptions of differing levels of intergroup salience between the two types of descriptions. While intergroup bias was evident, the results were complex. In Study 3 a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the same data set was conducted. This study explored differences between patients' and health professionals' goals, sociolinguistic strategies, and the patients' descriptions of the health professionals across the two types of conversational descriptions. Results revealed differences in goals, strategies, and descriptions. In the descriptions of satisfactory conversations, participants reported goals concerning reassurance and developing relationships. These two goals were not evident in the descriptions of unsatisfactory conversations, where attending to role relations was of greater importance. Participants reported the use of different sociolinguistic strategies for themselves and for health professionals across the different conversation types, which indicated that, for reports of satisfactory conversations, participants viewed their interactions with health professionals as more personal and positive than in the unsatisfactory ones. Participants described the health professionals in their descriptions of satisfactory conversations in more undifferentiated terms than the health professionals in the descriptions of unsatisfactory ones. Study 4 comprised two parts. First, using the data set from Studies 2 and 3, a qualitative analysis was conducted which explored thematic differences between the descriptions of satisfactory and unsatisfactory conversations. This analysis indicated more interpersonal themes for the satisfactory interactions and more negative intergroup themes for the unsatisfactory ones. Second, 134 participants rated 16 exemplar descriptions from the data set on 13 items derived from CAT. In general, the exemplars of satisfactory descriptions were rated as containing accommodative use of discourse management, emotional expression, and interpersonal control strategies. Exemplars of the unsatisfactory interactions were rated as more overaccommodative or counteraccommodative on these strategies. Study 5 introduced Part 2 of the thesis and involved a second data set. The stimuli were real-time videotaped interactions between health professionals and patients. Participants rated 25 videotaped interactions on 28 questions developed to tap the intergroup and interpersonal salience of the interaction. Of these 25 interactions, participants rated seven as highly intergroup and seven as highly interpersonal. These 14 interactions formed the stimuli for the Study 6. In Study 6 an LCM analysis of these 14 videotaped interactions compared the intergroup with the interpersonally rated interactions for levels of intergroup bias. The interpersonally salient interactions suggested lower intergroup bias than did the intergroup ones. This and other findings from the LCM analysis are discussed. Study 7 used a CAT perspective to examine six of the 14 videotaped interactions used in Study 6. These six interactions represented three videotaped interactions that were rated as highly intergroup, and three that were rated as highly interpersonal.. Participants provided ratings on both interactants' strategies, and health professionals' goals. They also rated the interactions for outcome measures, including patient satisfaction, and effective communication. Results indicated that the interactions rated as interpersonally salient were perceived as attending to relationship needs and emotional needs. Generally the interpersonal interactions were also rated as providing a more satisfactory outcome than the intergroup interactions. Together the seven studies provide evidence that interactions between health professionals and patients are essentially intergroup interactions. However, such interactions have the potential to move through dimensions of high intergroup and high interpersonal to dimensions of low intergroup and low interpersonal. Each pair of combinations provides different outcomes of communication effectiveness and satisfaction for the patient. Further, this research project demonstrates the ability of CAT to pick up on the dynamics of health provider and patient communication. It also highlights the usefulness of convergent methodologies to understand the complexities of patient and health professional interactions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Social Identity</field><field name="subject">Health Communication</field><field name="subject">Communication Accommodation Theory</field><field name="subject">Linguistic Category Model</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving the Implementation of Environmental Strategies in the Design of Buildings: Towards a Life-Cycle Based, Front-loaded Framework for Building Environmental Assessment During Design</field><field name="creator">Watson, Stephen John (Steve)</field><field name="description">An argument is developed for a new framework for design, to assist in overcoming barriers to the implementation of environmentally responsible solutions for building design. Though there exist the technical solutions to move towards more environmentally benign building practices, the vast majority of building designers do not employ these solutions in their designs. The research first identifies some problems to be overcome in order to improve the implementation of environmentally responsible design solutions. These problems are: the complexity and value conflict presented by environmental issues; the inability of designers to effectively pre-structure design problems in terms of environmental issues; the difficulty designers face in making design decisions regarding environmental issues; the ineffectiveness of existing tools at providing assistance with these problems, and the lack of ecological grounding of existing tools and of design thinking in general. The search for solutions to these problems guides the direction of the research. Three streams of investigation are conducted, making up the first three parts of the thesis. The first stream is an investigation of design methods which results in recommendations for ways of providing assistance to the designer. A range of existing environmental assessment tools are reviewed in the light of these recommendations and their suitability, as providers of design assistance, is evaluated. The second stream is an investigation of the potential for ecological theory to inform design thinking and then, hence, to inform the development of building environmental assessment tools. Seven principles for ecological design are developed and these shape further recommendations for means of providing assistance to designers. The third stream documents the testing of some of the recommendations, from theory, in practice. A series of case studies have been conducted in which two interventions have been made into the design process. The first intervention is the front-loading of the design process with environmental considerations by implementing an Environmental Brief. The second intervention is the introduction of life cycle thinking into the design process. The results from these three streams of investigation inform the development of a new model for building environmental assessment that provides assistance during the design process. The new model is a framework for the design process within which various components fulfil a series of interrelated tasks aimed at solving the problems that currently lead to poor implementation of environmental design strategies. The implementation of recommendations based on the seven principles for ecological design produce a new paradigm for environmental assessment of buildings. In particular the application of the building life cycle, in the form of an organisational structure for the framework, provides a means of visualising and mapping the relationships between the building and the environment. This helps the designer to better understand these relationships and therefore be able to better deal with their complexity and the conflicts arising between various competing environmental issues. The building life cycle, provides an overarching structure within which any environmental issues may be considered. This provides great flexibility, for consideration of unique project parameters, for the inclusion of different existing tools within the new framework and for the future evolution of the framework and the issues that it covers. The framework directs emphasis toward the early stages of the design process though the environmental briefing process. The briefing process assists with the setting of priorities for the client and design team, which in turn lead to the setting of design problems that are more likely to contain environmental criteria. The most beneficial aspect of this is found to be the improved pre-structuring of design problems over time as experience of previous projects is utilised when considering new ones. This highlights an important role for the framework as a record of the design process. This record can be used as a reference throughout the design of the building under consideration at the time, and for reference during the design of future projects.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental Design</field><field name="subject">Design Methods</field><field name="subject">Ecological Theory</field><field name="subject">Building Environmental Assessment</field><field name="subject">Life Cycle Thinking</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deepening democracy? A study of democracy education programs in Thailand</field><field name="creator">King, Deborah</field><field name="description">The constitution enacted in 1997 in Thailand contains many provisions for the Thai people to participate in decision making processes, exercise their civil rights and hold elected and public officials accountable. However, the people most in need of these reforms have little practical knowledge of their rights and liberties under this constitution. This thesis investigates the potential of democracy programs to enhance levels of citizen participation and awareness of democratic rights, and in this sense, deepen the procedural democracy established with the constitution in Thailand. Existing democratisation literature largely takes a macro, institutional approach. There is limited academic analysis of the micro aspects of how people acquire practical knowledge about their democratic rights in a way that can be of assistance in their daily lives. This thesis elaborates some of the relatively minute aspects of democratic deepening, of which there is a paucity within existing research. The dissertation pursues these concerns by investigating questions about how democracy is taught, who is doing the educating and why. Two different democracy education programs located in Isan, the northeast of Thailand, are examined as case studies. These programs are analyzed employing criteria drawn from an analysis of the characteristics of democratic deepening. A subsidiary line of inquiry is also applied to investigate whether there is a better general approach to take in democracy education, top down or bottom up. The first case study looks at the activities of two centres under the Parliament-Social Community Collaborative Activities Centre program of King Prajadhipok&#146;s Institute. The second case study examines two of the pilot courses of the Civic Participation in Local Governance curriculum. The research establishes the potential for democracy education programs to contribute to democratic deepening in Thailand. Nevertheless, enhancement of citizen participation and awareness of rights in a manner that is effective at personal and community levels is contingent upon a number of conditions. While the research confirms the importance of bottom up approaches to democracy education, it demonstrates that these approaches can emerge in a top down structure. Conversely, it was found that bottom up project design has the capacity for distortion. Contrary to the expectations of the research it was observed that the individual attitudes of the trainers or facilitators were as, if not more, important than project design. As well as providing another contribution to contemporary Thai studies, this research extends that part of the democratisation literature that focuses on the practical aspects of democratic deepening. It will also help inform public policy makers and debates over social capital, civil society and the appropriate boundaries of the public sphere.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">360100 Political Science</field><field name="subject">Local Information Center for Development (LICD)</field><field name="subject">informal institutions</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158004</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population ecology of Crocodylus porosus (Schneider 1801) in the Kimberley region of Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Kay, Winston</field><field name="description">Crocodylus porosus is the most widely distributed crocodilian species and suffered widespread population decline during the 20th century, principally due to commercial hunting for their hides, but also from habitat destruction and persecution. An estimated 270,000 to 330,000 animals were killed in Australia before the species was protected in the early 1970s. Populations of C. porosus in Western Australia are poorly studied and the number of animals taken during the hunting era is unknown. However, by 1970, hunting was no longer considered to be commercially viable. Over the last two decades, adding commercial value to crocodiles through sustainable use has been an integral part of the management strategy throughout Australia. Despite this, demographic parameters remain unquantified for most life-history stages. This study attempts to provide quantified demographic information for some populations of C. porosus in Western Australia. Patterns of movement are a fundamental component to the dynamics of animal populations. VHF radio tags were attached to 16 estuarine crocodiles, which were tracked between October 2001 and May 2003. Male (n = 12) and female (n = 4) crocodiles exhibited distinctly different patterns of movement. Females occupied a small core linear range (1.3 &amp;plusmn; 0.9 km) on the main river channel during the dry season and moved distances of up to 62 km to nesting habitat during the wet season, returning to the same core area the following dry season. Males moved considerable distances along the Ord River throughout the year. The largest range recorded was 87 km for a 2.5 m juvenile male, which had not stabilized. However, male ranges did not appear to be related to body size, with the largest two ranges recorded for the smallest (2.5 m) and largest (4.3 m) males tagged. Rates of male movement did not differ significantly between three size classes of males but there were significant seasonal differences, with the highest mean rates of movement occurring during the summer wet season (4.0 &amp;plusmn; 5.4 km/d). The highest rate of sustained movement was 9.8 km/d for a translocated 2.6 m juvenile male, which travelled 118 km in 12 days to return to the area of its capture. Neither males nor females showed exclusive habitat preferences for any of four broad riverine habitats identified on the Ord River. Males had substantial range overlaps with no obvious spatial partitioning, suggesting territoriality is not an important behavioural characteristic of free-ranging male crocodiles along the Ord River. Rates of migration were also examined indirectly using genetic data, which integrates patterns of movement at the population level over many generations. One hundred and twenty three tissue samples were collected from three river systems between April 2001 and September 2002. Levels of genetic diversity and structure were quantified at nine microsatellite loci. Genetic data indicated that C. porosus shows strong site fidelity. However, indirect estimates of migration from fixation indices suggest gene flow is sufficient to maintain genetic diversity and population substructure but not so low as to cause inbreeding. Genetic diversity was similar in all three populations examined with allelic richness ranging from 4.6 to 5.0 alleles per locus and mean observed heterozygosity ranging from 0.63 to 0.74. Inbreeding coefficients indicated there was only moderate differentiation among the populations (FST = 0.08, RST = 0.06) but differences in allele frequencies were highly significant. Assignment tests designated 80% of individuals to their population of origin and identified only five individuals (4%) as first generation migrants. Populations that experience a severe and rapid reduction in size, such as occurred with C. porosus following the Second World War, are susceptible to losing a significant component of their genetic variation. There was compelling evidence for a recent genetic bottleneck in the three populations sampled. Survivorship in C. porosus in unknown for most life-history stages so a mark-recapture study was implemented to investigate the dynamics of the C. porosus population in the King River. A total of 162 animals were marked between June 2001 and July 2002 of which 75 marked animals were recaptured on 123 occasions. The size of the hatchling population (age &lt; 1 year old) was estimated to be 91 &amp;plusmn; 2 (SE) in 2001, which was effectively an estimate of successful recruitment for the King River during that year. The size of the non-hatchling population (age &gt;1 year old) was estimated to be 69 &amp;plusmn; 13 but the precision of the estimate was low and should be treated cautiously. Survival of the 2001 cohort of hatchlings was high (&gt; 95%) between June and December and did not vary between the sexes. Hatchlings grew rapidly from June 2001 to July 2002, doubling in length and showing a ten-fold increase in body mass. There were no significant differences in growth rates between females and males during the first 18 months of life. Crocodiles showed a significant behavioural response to capture, with capture probabilities decreasing over time for two groups classified by age. Furthermore, differences in capture probabilities between age groups were significant on all occasions. This has important implications for monitoring crocodile populations, particularly if sightability is influenced by human disturbance. This study has provided some insights into important ecological processes operating within Western Australian populations of C. porosus, but the number of populations examined and period of study were small for such a long-lived animal. More work is needed to determine whether the patterns that have emerged are typical throughout the species' range and longer term studies will be required to quantify vital statistics for most life stages.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Crocodylus porosus</field><field name="subject">crocodiles</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">population genetics</field><field name="subject">demography</field><field name="subject">behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158003</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Device modelling for the Kane quantum computer architecture : solution of the donor electron Schrodinger equation</field><field name="creator">Kettle, Louise Marie</field><field name="description">In the Kane silicon-based electron-mediated nuclear spin quantum computer architecture, phosphorus is doped at precise positions in a silicon lattice, and the P donor nuclear spins act as qubits. Logical operations on the nuclear spins are performed using externally applied magnetic and electric fields. There are two important interactions: the hyperfine and exchange interactions, crucial for logical qubit operations. Single qubit operations are performed by applying radio frequency magnetic fields resonant with targeted nuclear spin transition frequencies, tuned by the gate-controlled hyperfine interaction. Two qubit operations are mediated through the exchange interaction between adjacent donor electrons. It is important to examine how these two interactions vary as functions of experimental parameters. Here we provide such an investigation. First, we examine the effects of varying several experimental parameters: gate voltage, magnetic field strength, inter donor separation, donor depth below the silicon oxide interface and back gate depth, to explore how these variables affect the donor electron density. Second, we calculate the hyperfine interaction and the exchange coupling as a function of these parameters. These calculations were performed using various levels of effective mass theory. In the first part of this thesis we use a multi-valley effective mass approach where we incorporate the full Si crystal Bloch structure in calculating the donor electron energy in the bulk silicon. Including the detailed Bloch structure is very computationally intensive, thus when we considered the effect of the externally applied fields in the second and third part, we employ an approach where we focus on the smooth donor-modulated envelope function to determine the response of the donor electron to the applied electric and magnetic fields and qubit position in the lattice. The electric field potential was obtained using Technology Computer Aided Design software, and the interfaces were modelled as a barrier using a step function. One of the critical results of this theoretical study was finding that there exist two regimes for the behaviour of the donor electron in response to the applied gate voltage, dependent on donor distance from the gate. When the qubit is in close proximity to the gate the electron transfer to the gate is gradual. However if the qubit is located far enough from the gate, we found that the donor electron is ionised toward the gate for gate voltages above a certain threshold. Another significant development we have made is in our calculations of the exchange coupling between two adjacent donor electrons. We extended our original Heitler-London basis to describe the two-electron system, and adopted a molecular orbital method where we included a a basis of 78 singlet and 66 triplet two-electron states. In addition to calculating a more accurate exchange coupling, we also evaluated the energy spectrum of the two electron double donor system. We aim to provide relevant information for the experimental design of these devices and highlight the significance of environmental factors other than gate potential that affect the donor electron.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">030701 Quantum Chemistry</field><field name="subject">quantum computing</field><field name="subject">chemical physics</field><field name="subject">quantum chemistry</field><field name="subject">condensed matter physics</field><field name="subject">nanoscale devices</field><field name="subject">numerical modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phylogeny, morphology and physiology of the secondary vascular system in fishes</field><field name="creator">Skov, Peter Vilhelm</field><field name="description">Vascular casts of three chondrichthian, one dipnoan, one chondrostean and 14 teleostean species were examined by light and scanning electron microscopy in order to give a qualitative and quantitative analysis of interarterial anastomoses (iaas) that indicate the presence (or absence) of a secondary vascular system (SVS). Anastomoses were found to originate from a variety of different primary blood vessels, many of which have not been previously identified as giving rise to secondary vessels. Segmental arteries derived from the dorsal aorta and supplying body musculature were major sites of origin of the SVS, although there was considerable variation in where, in the hierarchy of arterial branching, the anastomoses occurred. The degree of investment in a SVS was species specific, with more active species having a higher degree of secondary vascularisation. This difference was quantified using an absolute count of iaas between Anguilla reinhardtii and Trachinotus baillonii. A range of general features of the SVS is also described. No evidence of iaas was found on the coeliac, mesenteric or renal circulation in any species. Evidence of interarterial anastomoses were lacking in the dipnoan (Sarcopterygii) and chondrichthyan species examined, suggesting that a SVS is restricted to actinopterygian fishes. The presence and distribution of a secondary vascular system does not appear to be exclusively linked to phylogenetic position, but rather to the physiological adaptation of the species. Histological sections of primary segmental arteries and associated interarterial anastomoses and secondary vessels from the long-finned eel, Anguilla reinhardtii, were examined by light and transmission electron microscopy. Secondary vessels were found to originate from the primary vasculature as depressions through the tunica intima and media, from where they ran perpendicularly to the adventitial layer, before coiling extensively. From here the anastomoses travelled a relatively linear path in the outer margin of the adventitia to re-anastomose with a secondary vessel running in parallel with the primary counterpart. Secondary vessels had a structure quite similar to that of primary vessels; they were lined by endothelial cells on a continuous basement membrane, surrounded by single layer of smooth muscle cells surrounding the vessel. Smooth muscle cells were also found in the vicinity of interarterial anastomoses in the adventitia, but these were more longitudinally orientated. The presence of smooth muscle cells on all aspects of the secondary circulation suggests that this vascular system is regulated in a similar manner as the primary vascular system. Because interarterial anastomoses are structurally integrated with the primary vessel from which they originate, it was anticipated that flow through secondary vessels would to some extent be affected by an increase in primary vascular tone. Immunohistochemical studies showed that primary segmental arteries displayed moderate immunoreactivity to antibodies against 5-hydroxytryptamine and substance P, while interarterial anastomoses and secondary vessels showed dense immunoreactivity. Secondary vessels were followed to the surface of the animal through consecutive sections, where they eventually give rise to capillary beds overlying the scales. Secondary capillary beds were found to supply chloride cells in the skin, suggesting that this vascular system may be involved in cutaneous ionic exchange. Branchial vascular casts from two species of Tetraodontiformes showed that the vessels previously reported as nutrient vessels are with certainty part of the secondary vascular system. In the three-barred porcupine fish, Dicotylichthys punctulatus, interarterial anastomoses originated at high densities from efferent filamental and the efferent branchial arteries, from where they formed progressively larger secondary vessels. Small branches of this vascular system entered the filament body, where it gave rise to numerous side-vessels along the way. Large secondary vessels running in parallel with the efferent branchial arteries were found to constitute an additional arterio-arterial pathway, in that they exited the branchial basket in company with the afferent mandibular artery, the carotid artery and the efferent branchial arteries, from where they gave rise to vascular beds immediately after exit. The secondary vessels in this species were not found to supply the filament musculature; rather this vascular system was supplied by a single vessel derived from the efferent branchial artery, running in parallel with the afferent branchial artery. Secondary vessels were not found on any branchial component in the banded toadfish, Marylina pleurosticta, but in all other aspects the branchial vascular anatomy was similar to that of D. punctulatus. It is proposed that four independent vascular pathways may be present in the teleostean gill. The blood volume and flow rates of the primary (PVS) and secondary vascular system (SVS) were examined in the catadromous euryhaline teleost Lates calcarifer in order to determine whether any of these parameters were subject to change in individuals acclimated to seawater, compared to a group acclimated to freshwater. There was no significant difference in any measured parameter for the two groups. The volumes of the SVS were 0.67 &#132;b 0.13 and 0.76 &#132;b 0.13 mL 100g-1 body mass for FW and SW acclimated animals respectively. This constituted approximately one-third of the total blood volume in both groups. Turnover times for the SVS ranged from 21.0 to 25.2 minutes, demonstrating in accordance with previous publications, that this system is considerably more dynamic than previously assumed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270604 Comparative Physiology</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="subject">secondary vessels</field><field name="subject">anatomy</field><field name="subject">control</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="subject">immunohistochemistry</field><field name="subject">histology</field><field name="subject">blood vessels</field><field name="subject">primary</field><field name="subject">secondary</field><field name="subject">volume</field><field name="subject">flow</field><field name="subject">chondrichthyes</field><field name="subject">dipnoi</field><field name="subject">actinopterygii</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robust control of an articulating flexible structure using MIMO QFT</field><field name="creator">Kerr, Murray Lawrence</field><field name="description">Quantitative Feedback Theory (QFT) is a control system design methodology founded on the premise that feedback is necessary only because of system uncertainty. Articulating flexible structures, such as flexible manipulators, present a difficult closed-loop control problem. In such servo systems, the coupling of the rigid and flexible modes and the non-minimum phase dynamics severely limit system stability and performance. The difficulties in controlling these structures is exacerbated by the denumerably infinite number of flexible modes and associated difficulties in developing accurate dynamic models for controller design. As such, the control of articulating flexible structures presents a non-trivial testbed for the design of QFT based robust control systems. This dissertation examines the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) QFT based control of an articulating flexible structure and presents an enhancement of the theoretical basis for the MIMO QFT design methodologies. The control problem under consideration is the active vibration control of an articulating single-link flexible manipulator. This is facilitated by an actuation scheme comprised of a combination of spatially discrete actuation, in the form of a DC motor to perform articulation, and spatially distributed actuation, in the form of a piezoelectric transducer for active vibration control. In the process of developing and experimentally validating the QFT based control system, shortcomings in the theoretical basis for the MIMO QFT design methodologies are addressed. Robust stability theorems are developed for the two main MIMO QFT design methodologies, namely the sequential and non-sequential MIMO QFT design methodologies. The theorems complement and extend the existing theoretical basis for the MIMO QFT design methodologies. The dissertation results expose salient features of the MIMO QFT design methodologies and provide connections to other multivariable design methodologies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">230119 Systems Theory and Control</field><field name="subject">671401 Scientific instrumentation</field><field name="subject">QFT</field><field name="subject">Control</field><field name="subject">Multivariable Control</field><field name="subject">Robust Control</field><field name="subject">Flexible Manipulator</field><field name="subject">Piezoelectric</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158000</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Technology Of The Pr&#230;ternatural: An Operational Analysis and Empirical Study of the Psycho-Phenomenology of Mystical, Visionary and Remote Perception Experiences</field><field name="creator">Nelson, Peter Laurence</field><field name="description">In Part I of this thesis, mystical experience is defined in terms of some of the classical philosophical and psychological issues which surround it. It is also connected to the general class of the &#145;pr&#230;ternatural&#146; which is defined operationally as those visionary and remote perception experiences which have a quality of &#145;supernaturalness&#146; as defined by Hultkrantz. The psycho-phenomenology of these states, taking mystical experience as the sine qua non of pr&#230;ternatural experiences, is developed from both religious and secular perspectives and related to issues of psychopathology. This is followed by a discussion of the problems of interpretation and an ontologically neutral, operational and phenomenological method, which emphasizes the &#145;how&#146; rather than the meaning of these experiences, is posited. This approach then is cast in the mould of consciousness studies as the most suitable theoretical position from which to pursue the paradigm of the &#145;how&#146;. The next part of this section examines contemporary theories of consciousness and critiques them in terms of their ontological assumptions, epistemological ascriptions and suitability for an empirical, operational, psycho-phenomenological study of human experience. This examination commences with the &#145;non-consciousness&#146; of James&#146; Radical Empiricism and the phenomenological position as re-interpreted by Sartre in Chapter 3 and continues in Chapter 4 with an analysis of the psychological-cognitive and neurophysiological reductive hypotheses current today. It concludes with the notion of consciousness which arises from the current interpretations of modern physics. Chapter 5 attempts to build a concept of consciousness as &#145;pan-consciousness&#146; which is strictly operational and free of ontological grounding. In this notion, things, objects, states and human &#145;observers&#146; all arise as the reflective processes of &#145;pan-consciousness&#146; as process without the need for a final &#145;location&#146; or &#145;object&#146;. This section closes with a suggestion for a method of empirically studying experience within the proposed theoretical context. Part II is an exploratory investigation of the operational and phenomenological aspects of pr&#230;ternatural experience. The three dimensions of Personality, Operational and Phenomenological as the basis of experience are defined and set in the context of psycho-phenomenological research using verbal reports as data. The first part of the investigation, reported in Chapter 7, is a non-random survey of the populations of Queensland and Griffith universities and it reveals a level of occurrence consistent with the 20-40 percent found in overseas studies such as those of Hay and others. Chapters 8 and 9 detail an in-depth psycho-phenomenological study of 120 cases drawn from the original sample. Using Direct Discriminant Function Analysis and Principal Components Analysis an empirical case is made for two general types of pr&#230;ternatural experience - Ontic and Perceptual. This exploratory investigation also establishes differences on all three dimensions between pr&#230;ternatural experience and &#145;normal&#146;, everyday, &#145;veridical&#146; experience. It appears, therefore, to extend Tart&#146;s theoretical position as well as confirming some of the preliminary research on mystical experience conducted by Hood and others while opening a new, &#145;three-dimensional&#146;, approach to the study of experiential states.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">religion</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">mysticism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157999</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Reproduction, Growth, Feeding and Impacts of Exploitation of the Venus Tuskfish (Choerodon venustus) With some implications for its management.</field><field name="creator">Platten, John Robert</field><field name="description">This study examines the biology of the venus tuskfish Choerodon venustus from the southern Great Barrier Reef to enable better-informed management decisions. Venus tuskfish are taken almost exclusively by line fishing. The size of the catch is uncertain, but the annual Queensland commercial catch is probably about 30 t and the recreational catch much greater than this (possibly ca. 300 t). The species is not the primary target of fishers and can be regarded as by-catch taken while targeting other species. However C. venustus is the second or third most commonly retained species in the study area. Venus tuskfish are taken in habitats associated with coral and other reefs across a depth range from 5 m to 90 m. The species is a benthic predator, taking molluscs, echinoderms, annelids, arthropods, and fish (in decreasing order of importance). Feeding intensity was greatest in summer. There was evidence of complex feeding behaviours and a dominance hierarchy amongst feeding fish that may result in large males being more susceptible to fishing. The species is slow growing and long lived. Up to 38 bands were observed on the opercular bones of C. venustus. Back-calculation methods yielded von Bertalanffy growth parameters of L&#165; =669 mm, K = 0.09 and t0 = -3.89. Male fish appear to grow faster than females. This may be related either to faster growing fish becoming males, growth acceleration following sex reversal, or both. Selective removal of faster growing males in heavily fished locations may result in a greater proportion of slower growing females in the remaining population. iv Choerodon venustus is a protogynous hermaphrodite; the proportion of males increases as the fish increase in size, transitional fish exist and remnant female tissue was evident in testes. The species is a serial spawner with an extended breeding season perhaps peaking in autumn and around the new and full moon. Females mature between 200 and 250 mm forklength (LCF). Venus tuskfish display sexually dimorphic colouration and appear to have a socio-sexual group structure. Fish occur in extended groups with several large males associated with a larger number of smaller females. Multiple sex-reversals may occur in the groups perhaps in response to the loss of the larger males. Large females produce over 100,000 eggs in the ovaries. The number of eggs released at each spawning is unknown. There is a direct cubic relationship between length and the weight of female gonads. Large females over 500 mm LCF are capable of producing over 20 times the number of eggs of small mature females (around 250 mm LCF). The locations sampled showed marked differences in fishing effort. The Capricorn Bunker Group was subject to much higher fishing effort than the Swains Reefs. Estimates of fishing mortality reflected this trend. Line fishing selects large male fish. The heavily fished Masthead Island had smaller males, females and transitional fish. Fish below 300 mm LCF were not captured efficiently. Venus tuskfish may be capable of modifying their life cycle in response to increased fishing mortality. Sex reversal may be related to the absence of large males in social groups. Hence sex ratio remains constant between fished and unfished locations. In heavily fished populations, females are smaller and consequently produce fewer eggs. Modeling suggests unfished areas may have a potential fecundity over six times that of those heavily exploited. Choerodon venustus are severely impacted by barotrauma during capture, and few captured and released fish are likely to survive. There are special challenges in managing venus tuskfish including: &#183; Their status as a largely bycatch species; &#183; The poor survival of released fish due to barotrauma; &#183; A lack of good measures of catch and effort caused by inconsistent naming of the species and inherent errors in current data collection methods; &#183; Their extended spawning period and likely widespread spawning sites and &#183; The need to support group fecundity by protecting larger fish. A combination of a series of fish reserves, raising the minimum legal size to 36 cm TL, effective catch limits and an effective education program are likely to support the sustainability of the fishery.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Choerodon</field><field name="subject">Tuskfish</field><field name="subject">Effects of Fishing</field><field name="subject">Southern Great Barrier Reef</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157998</field></doc><doc><field name="title">FUNDING AUSTRALIAN CATHOLIC SCHOOLS FOR THE COMMON GOOD IN NEW TIMES: POLICY CONTEXTS, POLICY PARTICIPANTS AND THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES</field><field name="creator">Furtado, Michael Leonard</field><field name="description">Catholic schools in Australia, which educate about twenty per cent of the Australian school-going population, are private-sector schools. As such, they are substantially funded by a combination of grants from State and Commonwealth sources but have chosen to compensate for shortfalls in their operational expenses by charging fees. Successive Australian governments have for the past quarter of a century provided largely bipartisan support for the public funding of Catholic schools in Australia, yet the policy contexts in which this support has been given vary markedly. Prior to that, Catholic and other denominational schools were largely unfunded by the state, resulting in the near collapse of most non- Catholic denominational schools, when the Australian state entered the schools provision sphere in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Catholic schools survived and prospered during the ensuing century largely by importing many thousands of teaching religious, principally from Ireland, but the strain began to show after the Second World War, when Australia embarked on a major expansion of its immigration program, and religious vocations from Ireland and elsewhere began to decline. The Australian Labor Party, for all kinds of socio-cultural reasons the major representative at the time of Catholic political interests, but split on the issue of state-aid, was keen to rebuild party unity and saw the public funding of non-government schools as the key to creating a dual system of education to meet Australia's schooling needs. It succeeded in doing this and in transporting itself to government by the pragmatic overcoming of the split and through a commitment to funding all Australian schools on a needs basis. Since the mid-seventies non-government schools have been the beneficiaries of a general resolution to the state-aid debate that has seen relatively little difference between both sides of politics on schools-funding matters and which has kept state-aid off the agenda of hitherto intractable political problems. However, recent trends in funding policy, vigorously driven by the Commonwealth Coalition government after 1996, with its pursuit of market-oriented policies in key social and economic areas, have fuelled the rapid deregulation of the Australian educational environment, starting with the rationalising of funds for government and non-government schools. At the forefront of such change, Catholic schools were regarded by the former Commonwealth Education Minister, Dr Kemp, as models of the future provision of Australian schooling, and as an example of the mutual obligation of the public and private sectors in relation to the provision of essential social goods and services. Catholic Education in Australia must therefore serve two political masters for quite distinctive and different reasons, viz. the Common or Public Good on the one hand, and the notion of parental or private choice on the other. The notion of the Common Good is the most central and fundamental element in Catholic Social Teaching, adjuring Roman Catholics to move beyond a morality that is purely personal to include the social and structural dimensions of public life. Will it be possible for Catholic Education to reconcile these two evidently mutually exclusive principles, while striving to meet its own commitments to bridging the gap between funding and costs with fees in the additional context of maintaining its mission to make its schools accessible to all Catholics? Thus, Catholic schools in Australia find themselves a century or so after the cessation of state aid, and twenty-five years after its recommencement, at yet another crossroads, with a multiplicity of new factors to consider in terms of funding policy. This thesis researches one way in which this multiplicity of apparently contradictory and mutually exclusive imperatives may agreeably be met in order to ensure the long-term viability of Catholic schools in Australia. It does so by investigating the proposal of the late Mr George Berkeley, a former Director- General of Education in Queensland, in his report on non-government schools in the Australian Capital Territory, which reads as follows: In the longer term consideration needs to be given to some breaking down of the current dual system of government and non-government schools, and to the possible integration of non-government schools (particularly those serving similar populations as government schools) with government schools while still allowing the non-government schools to retain the important aspects of their special character. (Report to the Minister for Education and Training on Needs Based Funding for ACT Non-Government Schools, 1992) The fact that virtually no consideration was given to this proposal, and that the Working Party set up to consider the Berkeley Report unreservedly agreed on all of Berkeley's other proposals, highlights two important anomalies that inhibit the development of state-aid policy in Australia, and which George Berkeley by his own admission was seeking to rectify once and for all. The first is to do with the enormously bifurcated (in terms of source) complexity of the schools-funding arrangement in Australia, in which the States provide most of the funding for government schools, and the Commonwealth most of the funding for non-government schools, thus making comparability of figures slippery and a cause for confusion and potential misinterpretation and division by government and non-government school lobbies alike. The second, connected with the first, derives from Berkeley's eagerness as a practising Catholic and a Director-General of Queensland Education to remove inter-sectoral disputes, and the potential for them especially before elections to become standard occurrences in the political and electioneering landscape of Australia. While it could be argued that Berkeley stepped outside his terms of reference in bringing down his Report, his recommendation, particularly in relation to such a senior and experienced educational administrator to consider the integration model of schools, now well-established in New Zealand, could not be dismissed as easily as it had been by the working party set up to receive his Report and comment on it. Accordingly, as part of the research reported here, I travelled to New Zealand to examine in detail the conditions under which non-government schools in general and Roman Catholic schools in particular had been brought into the public sector in 1975 under a special agreement covered by an Act of Integration, which, among other things, protected the special character of each school, and to assess how that arrangement had worked. From this core of information, I developed a series of categories of description, both positive as well as negative, in relation to responses to integrated schools that were put to a variety of persons critically influential in the schools-funding debate in Australia. Whereas initially there had been little or no interest, or otherwise hostility, engendered by the very idea of opening up discussion on a new mode of funding schools in Australia, this new approach, validated by the phenomenographic research method, was able to generate a considerable body of reason and opinion, initially in relation to why participants were so opposed to the idea of integration. Such a strategy enabled me to address through the subdiscipline of Policy Sociology some of the deepest and most heartfelt misgivings of participants in relation to the integration proposal and, in addressing each one of them, to arrive at a series of proposals which would satisfy and eliminate such misgivings, should the general consensus about current ways of funding school education in Australia collapse or in some other way be found to be deficient. The opportunity or danger of such a thing happening has emerged through dramatic recent changes to the mechanism of funding government and non-government schools by the Commonwealth government, called the Enrolment Benchmark Adjustment or EBA, and which in effect has introduced an opportunity-cost factor to rationalise and follow the steady stream of school students away from the government and into the private sector. Additionally, the Commonwealth Coalition government has changed the basis of Commonwealth needs-based funding of non-government schools to exclude private resources as a basis of funding, thus advantaging a category of elite schools hitherto ineligible to receive substantial public subsidies. Meanwhile Australian private schools, an increasing percentage of them new non-Catholic providers, now educate more than thirty percent of Australians as opposed to twenty percent a decade ago, fewer Catholics than ever before attend Catholic schools, and State governments, such as New South Wales, committed to preserving the quality of government schools, which are a &#145;States&#146; right constitutionally, have cut their proportion of subsidies to the wealthier non-government schools in an act of evident retaliation. This development points to the reopening of the state-aid debate, the collapse of a bipartisan schools funding policy, and the need to review the assumptions on which state-aid to Catholic schools, at the very least, was commenced a quarter century ago. As a resolution to this problem, this thesis argues for the incorporation of Catholic systemic schools into an expanded and deregulated Australian educational public sector, as in New Zealand, and addresses in detail, some of the political and constitutional difficulties in doing so.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Catholic Education</field><field name="subject">Funding</field><field name="subject">Common Good</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157997</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of temperature and photoperiod on broccoli development, yield and quality in south-east Queensland</field><field name="creator">Tan, Daniel Kean Yuen</field><field name="description">Broccoli is a vegetable crop of increasing importance in Australia, particularly in south-east Queensland and farmers need to maintain a regular supply of good quality broccoli to meet the expanding market. However, harvest maturity date, head yield and quality are all affected by climatic variations during the production cycle, particularly low temperature episodes. There are also interactions between genotype and climatic variability. A predictive model of ontogeny, incorporating climatic data including frost risk, would enable farmers to predict harvest maturity date and select appropriate cultivar &#150; sowing date combinations. The first stage of this research was to define floral initiation, which is fundamental to predicting ontogeny. Scanning electron micrographs of the apical meristem were made for the transition from the vegetative to advanced reproductive stage. During the early vegetative stage (stage 1), the apical meristem was a small, pointed shoot tip surrounded by leaf primordia. The transitional stage (stage 2) was marked by a widening and flattening to form a dome-shaped apical meristem. In the floral initiation stage (stage 3), the first-order floral primordia were observed in the axils of the developing bracts. Under field conditions, the shoot apex has an average diameter of 500 &amp;plusmn; 3 &#181;m at floral initiation and floral primordia can be observed under a light microscope. Sub-zero temperatures can result in freezing injury and thereby reduce head yield and quality. In order to predict the effects of frosts, it is desirable to know the stages of development at which plants are most susceptible. Therefore, the effects of sub-zero temperatures on leaf and shoot mortality, head yield and quality were determined after exposure of plants to a range of temperatures for short periods, at different stages of development (vegetative, floral initiation and buttoning). Plants in pots and in the field were subjected to sub-zero temperature regimes from &#150;1 &#176;C to &#150;19 &#176;C. Extracellular ice formation was achieved by reducing temperatures slowly, at a rate of -2 &#176;C per hour. The floral initiation stage was most sensitive to freezing injury, as yields were significantly reduced at &#150;1 &#176;C and &#150;3 &#176;C, and shoot apices were killed at &#150;5 &#176;C. There was no significant yield reduction when the inflorescence buttoning iv stage was subjected to &#150;1 &#176;C and &#150;3 &#176;C. Although shoot apices at buttoning survived the &#150;5 &#176;C treatment, very poor quality heads of uneven bud size were produced as a result of arrested development. The lethal temperature for pot-grown broccoli was between &#150;3 &#176;C and &#150;5 &#176;C, whereas the lethal temperature for field-grown broccoli was between &#150;7 &#176;C and &#150;9 &#176;C. The difference was presumably due to variation in cold acclimation. Freezing injury can reduce broccoli head yield and quality, and retard plant growth. Crop development models based only on simple thermal time without restrictions will not predict yield or maturity if broccoli crops are frostdamaged. Field studies were conducted to develop procedures for predicting ontogeny, yield and quality. Three cultivars, (&#145;Fiesta&#146;, &#145;Greenbelt&#146; and &#145;Marathon&#146;) were sown on eight dates from 11 March to 22 May 1997, and grown under natural and extended (16 h) photoperiods in a sub-tropical environment at Gatton College, south-east Queensland, under non-limiting conditions of water and nutrient supply. Daily climatic data, and dates of emergence, floral initiation, harvest maturity, together with yield and quality were obtained. Yield and quality responses to temperature and photoperiod were quantified. As growing season mean minimum temperatures decreased, fresh weight of tops decreased while fresh weight harvest index increased linearly. There was no definite relationship between fresh weight of tops or fresh weight harvest index and growing season minimum temperatures &gt; 10 &#176;C. Genotype, rather than the environment, mainly determined head quality attributes. &#145;Fiesta&#146; had the best head quality, with higher head shape and branching angle ratings than &#145;Greenbelt&#146; or &#145;Marathon&#146;. Bud colour and cluster separation of &#145;Marathon&#146; were only acceptable for export when growing season mean minimum temperatures were &lt; 8 &#176;C. Photoperiod did not influence yield or quality in any of the three cultivars. A better understanding of genotype and environmental interactions will help farmers optimise yield and quality, by matching cultivars with time of sowing. Crop developmental responses to temperature and photoperiod were quantified from emergence to harvest maturity (Model 1), from emergence to floral initiation (Model 2), from floral initiation to harvest maturity (Model 3), and in a combination of Models 2 and 3 (Model 4). These thermal time models were based on optimised base v and optimum temperatures of 0 and 20 &#176;C, respectively. These optimised temperatures were determined using an iterative optimisation routine (simplex). Cardinal temperatures were consistent across cultivars but thermal time of phenological intervals were cultivar specific. Sensitivity to photoperiod and solar radiation was low in the three cultivars used. Thermal time models tested on independent data for five cultivars (&#145;Fiesta&#146;, &#145;Greenbelt&#146;, &#145;Marathon&#146;, &#145;CMS Liberty&#146; and &#145;Triathlon&#146;) grown as commercial crops on the Darling Downs over two years, adequately predicted floral initiation and harvest maturity. Model 4 provided the best prediction for the chronological duration from emergence to harvest maturity. Model 1 was useful when floral initiation data were not available, and it predicted harvest maturity almost as well as Model 4 since the same base and optimum temperatures of 0 &#176;C and 20 &#176;C, respectively, were used for both phenological intervals. Model 1 was also generated using data from 1979-80 sowings of three cultivars (&#145;Premium Crop&#146;, &#145;Selection 160&#146; and &#145;Selection 165A&#146;). When Model 1 was tested with independent data from 1983-84, it predicted harvest maturity well. Where floral initiation data were available, predictions of harvest maturity were most precise using Model 3, since the variation, which occurred from emergence to floral initiation, was removed. Prediction of floral initiation using Model 2 can be useful for timing cultural practices, and for avoiding frost and high temperature periods. This research has produced models to assist broccoli farmers in crop scheduling and cultivar selection in south-east Queensland. Using the models as a guide, farmers can optimise yield and quality, by matching cultivars with sowing date. By accurately predicting floral initiation, the risk of frost damage during floral initiation can be reduced by adjusting sowing dates or crop management options. The simple and robust thermal time models will improve production and marketing arrangements, which have to be made in advance. The thermal time models in this study, incorporating frost risk using conditional statements, provide a foundation for a decision support system to manage the sequence of sowings on commercial broccoli farms.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Broccoli</field><field name="subject">Brassica oleracea</field><field name="subject">Brassicaceae</field><field name="subject">Model</field><field name="subject">thermal time</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">yield</field><field name="subject">quality</field><field name="subject">freezing injury</field><field name="subject">frost</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157996</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of denitrifying microbial communities in activated sludge exposed to external carbon sources</field><field name="creator">Ginige, Maneesha Prasaad</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to identify the denitrifying microbial communities in activated sludge from full-scale treatment plants and from small-scale reactors exposed to acetate or methanol as external carbon sources. Biological denitrification is currently the most widely used, sustainable and cost-effective process to remove nitrogen from wastewater. Increasingly strict effluent discharge standards are posing significant challenges to plant operators to reduce effluent NO3--N concentrations to levels as low as 2-3 mg L-1 or even lower. The lack of sufficient influent carbon in many municipal wastewater treatment plants makes it very difficult to achieve such low NO3--N concentrations in the effluent. An effective solution to the problem is to introduce additional external carbon sources to enhance denitrification. The selection of external carbon sources is not purely based on costs but is also dependent on the possible microbial transformations that these carbon sources may bring about in activated sludge. The most common carbon source used is methanol due to its low cost, but it has been found to cause long delays until an improvement in denitrification performance is observed. On the other hand, acetate has been found to improve denitrification almost instantaneously when added, but it has a significantly higher cost. In this study, methanol and acetate utilising denitrifiers were investigated in activated sludge with and without enrichment in laboratory scale bioreactors. The relevant denitrifiers were identified and evaluated in situ using culture independent methods particularly stable isotope probing (SIP), 16S rDNA cloning, fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and microautoradiography (MAR). Activated sludge collected from a biological nutrient removal plant exhibiting good denitrification was enriched in an anoxically-operated sequencing batch reactor (SBR) by feeding methanol as the sole carbon source and nitrate as the electron acceptor. The SBR was operated over a duration of 7 months and the SBR denitrification rate improved from 0.02 mg NO3--N mg mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS)-1 h-1 to a steady-state value of 0.06 mg NO3-N mg MLVSS-1 h-1. At steady state operation the enriched biomass was subjected to SIP with 13C-methanol to biomark the denitrifiers capable of utilising methanol under anoxic conditions. The separated 12C-DNA and 13C-DNA fractions from the SIP experiment were individually subjected to full cycle rRNA analysis. The dominant 16S rRNA gene phylotype (Group-A clones) in the 13C-library was closely related to the obligate methylotrophs Methylobacillus and Methylophilus in the order Methylophilales of the Betaproteobacteria (96-97% sequence identities), while the most abundant clone groups in the 12C-library mostly belonged to the family Saprospiraceae in the Bacteroidetes phylum. Oligonucleotide probes were designed for FISH to target the Group-A clones and Methylophilales (probes DEN67 and MET1216, respectively) and the Saprospiraceae clones (probe SAP553). Application of these probes on SBR biomass over the enrichment period demonstrated a strong correlation between the level of SBR denitrification and relative abundance of DEN67-targeted bacteria in the SBR community. By contrast, no correlation was found between denitrification rate and the relative abundances of the well known denitrifying genera Hyphomicrobium and Paracoccus nor the Saprospiraceae-clones visualised by FISH in the SBR biomass. FISH combined with microautoradiography independently confirmed that the DEN67-targeted cells were the dominant bacterial group capable of anoxic [14C] methanol uptake in the enriched biomass. As observed in full-scale operations, the methanol-fed SBR experienced a lag period of several weeks before denitrification performance increased. Using FISH quantification, it was shown that this coincided with the lag phase in the growth of the DEN67-targeted denitrifying population. It was therefore concluded that the Methylophilales bacteria dominant in our SBR system are likely to be important in full-scale methanol-fed denitrifying sludges. The acetate utilising microbial consortium in activated sludge was investigated without prior enrichment using stable isotope probing (SIP). 13C-acetate was used in SIP to biomark the DNA of the denitrifiers. The extracted 13C-DNA fraction was subjected to a full cycle rRNA analysis. The dominant 16S rRNA gene phylotypes in the 13C-library were closely related to bacterial families Comamonadaceae and Rhodocyclaceae of class Betaproteobacteria (96-97% sequence identities). Seven oligonucleotide probes (DEN444, DEN220, DEN581, DEN441, DEN124, DEN220a and DEN1454) for use in FISH was designed to specifically target the identified phylotypes. Application of these probes on the sludge of a continuously fed denitrifying sequencing batch reactor (CFDSBR) operated over a duration of 16 days indicated a strong correlation between the level of CFDSBR denitrification and relative abundance of all probe-targeted bacteria in the CFDSBR community. FISH combined with microautoradiography (FISH-MAR) further confirmed that the DEN581- and DEN124-targeted cells dominating the CFDSBR were capable of taking up [14C] acetate under anoxic conditions. The initial occurrence of the DEN444- and DEN1454-targeted bacteria and the final dominance of DEN581- and DEN124-targeted bacteria in the CFDSBR community were likely related to the changing in-reactor nitrite concentrations during the first few days of CFDSBR operation. Hence, the DEN444- and DEN1454-targeted bacteria were hypothesised to have low affinities for nitrite while DEN124- and DEN581-targeted bacteria have higher nitrite affinities. However, it was clear that all probe-targeted bacteria were denitrifiers capable of utilising acetate as a carbon source. The rapid increase in numbers of the probe-targeted organisms positively correlates with the immediate increase in denitrification rates. The rapid response and community shifts observed when acetate was used to enhance denitrification suggest that an intermittent application of acetate is quite effective to temporarily enhance the denitrification capacity of a treatment plant. However, the importance of a bacterial impact assessment of activated sludge subjected to intermittent acetate supplementation is recommended prior to the wide use of acetate in the wastewater industry. The acetate utilising denitrifying microbial communities investigated in the previous chapter were characterised according to their eco-physiological properties using the r- and K-selection criteria. The electron donor (acetate) and acceptor (nitrite) affinities of these probe-identified denitrifiers were used as traits for this characterisation. The substrate to microorganism (S/M) ratio was manipulated to provide high and low substrate concentrations in the reactor to create conditions favourable for r- and K-strategists, respectively. Two factors, namely feeding regimes and sludge retention times, were studied to achieve the desired S/M ratios and enable r/K characterisation. The high substrate affinities and high specific growth rates of two probe-identified denitrifiers (DEN124 and DEN581) did not enable resolution of these two organisms with the feeding regimes used in this study. However, the application of different sludge retention times as a control strategy to maintain constant high and low in-reactor S/M ratios enabled characterisation of the two probe-targeted denitrifiers DEN124 and DEN581 as K- and r-strategists, respectively. The in-reactor S/M ratios applied in this study did not facilitate the characterisation of populations targeted by probes DEN444 and DEN1454. The minor fluctuations of the S/M ratios during a cycle in the SBR operation was considered as a drawback, but conclusive results could still be obtained from the study. A chemostat reactor operation with constant loading and variable flow rates is suggested as an alternative. Conclusively, this study was able to identify specific groups of denitrifying microorganisms in activated sludge when exposed to acetate and methanol. Unlike most previous studies, which relied on culture dependent methods, this study adopted a pure culture independent approach to identify microorganisms in relation to their function, i.e. denitrification. Moreover, acetate denitrifiers were in situ characterised based on eco-physiological properties. The identification of denitrifying communities in this study has paved the way to a larger research project on the optimisation of denitrification processes with external acetate, methanol and other carbon supplements. As such, this study has contributed significantly to the understanding of the denitrification processes by linking process data with microbial investigations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">270399 Microbiology not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">770502 Land and water management</field><field name="subject">290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="subject">670700 Industrial Chemicals and Related Products</field><field name="subject">Wastewater treatment</field><field name="subject">Activated sludge</field><field name="subject">Nitrogen removal</field><field name="subject">External carbon</field><field name="subject">FISH</field><field name="subject">MAR</field><field name="subject">Denitrification</field><field name="subject">Bacteria</field><field name="subject">Ecology</field><field name="subject">Microorganisms</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157995</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SIMULATION, VALIDATION AND APPLICATION OF A NOVEL MELT FLOW MODEL FOR HIGHLY ENTANGLED LINEAR AND LONG CHAIN BRANCHED POLYMERS</field><field name="creator">Clemeur, Nicolas</field><field name="description">It is widely recognised that the development and optimisation of industrial processes such as extrusion or injection moulding significantly benefit from accurate polymer processing simulations. Such simulations can lead to enormous cost savings, time to market and product improvements. The development of suitable constitutive models and a robust numerical algorithm are required for successful application of such tool to these processes. Appropriate material characterisation is also imperative to select the constitutive model parameters. Despite the importance and maturity of the polymer processing industry, the constitutive modelling of the rheological behaviour of long chain branched polymers presents still fascinating questions that need some answers. A breakthrough in this area was the design of a constitutive equation based on molecular arguments and known as the pom-pom model. The key feature of this model is the presence of separate relaxation times for the orientation and stretch mechanisms. The pompom model has been proved to be very accurate for the modelling of long chain branched polymers in rheometrical flows. Although very promising, this model suffers from numerical and rheological defects that hinder its use in complex flow simulations. To overcome these issues, the Double Convected pom-pom (DCPP) model is proposed. Its predictive capabilities are first analysed in various rheometrical flows including reverse multi-step shear strain and large amplitude oscillatory shear experiments. For complex flow simulation, the DCPP model is implemented in the commercial package POLYFLOW.Model predictions are compared to experimental birefringence data in planar contraction flows. In all cases, a satisfactory agreement is found between numerical simulation and experiments, demonstrating the potential of this model for the simulation of polymer processing operations. The simulations are then extended to three-dimensional geometries. The influence of non-perfectly two-dimensional flows on birefringence data is analysed. It is shown that the impact of these imperfections is strongly dependent on the flow rate. Is is commonly believed that increasing the geometry aspect ratio tends to decrease three-dimensional influence. It is demonstrated that this is verified only if the zero-order fringe does not disappear at any time during the experiment. Finally, a pragmatic approach is introduced to reformulate constitutive equations to explicitly express them in terms of orientation and stretch variables. This procedure is applied to the Phan-Thien Tanner and Giesekus models and both modelsare compared to the DCPP model. Comparing the models in this form, highlights their differences, and allows one to adopt the best features of each. This almost naturally leads to a proposal of a number of modifications to each of these models. The modified models are then assessed in rheometrical flows by comparing model predictions to experimental data. Significant improvements are demonstrated for in particular the Modified Giesekus model and the Modified DCPP: both models perform remarkably well in a range of non-linear rheometric flows, and are therefore promising candidates for predicting industrial flow problems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Viscoelastic constitutive equations</field><field name="subject">Pom-pom</field><field name="subject">Birefringence</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157994</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cellular immune therapy as a basis for multi-modality cancer therapy</field><field name="creator">Mattarollo, Stephen Robert</field><field name="description">Treatment of cancer remains largely ineffective despite ongoing efforts to improve therapy modalities. Conventional treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation have proven to be effective in some cases, however the unstable genome of transformed cells leads to mutations and generation of new sub-clones that are able to escape therapeutic control. Overcoming tumour resistance requires the development of alternative or additional modalities of treatment that optimally would possess greater selectivity for tumour targets, provide alternative cytotoxic mechanisms and have non-cross reactive toxicities with current treatments. Cellular immunotherapy is an attractive alternative to conventional treatments. Harnessing the patients&#146; own immune cell defence system to recognize and kill tumour cells reduces the risk of toxicity associated with administering chemotherapy or radiation and has the potential to be highly specific towards malignant tissue. In many clinical situations there is evidence that combination therapy, utilising two or more modalities of treatment simultaneously, is superior to single agent therapy. Combining drugs or agents on the basis of differing mechanisms of action has the theoretical capacity to increase anti-tumour cytotoxicity with minimal increases in systemic or tissue toxicity. Also, there are reduced chances of resistance emerging when a number of modalities are used. The research undertaken for this dissertation aimed to determine the potential therapeutic benefits of combining cell based immune therapy with chemotherapy agents and the bisphosphonate, zoledronate, for improvements in therapy of solid malignancies. Human immune effector cells, VH24/VO11 NKT cells and VB9VD2 T cells, possess potent cytotoxic anti-tumour activities against a range of tumour cell types without the requirement for MHC-restriction. These effector cell populations were assessed for their direct cytotoxic capacity against solid tumour-derived targets in combination with anti-tumour agents. Mechanistic interactions between effector cells, chemotherapy and zoledronate were investigated and a human in vivo trafficking study of adoptively transferred VB9VD2 T cells was performed to predict the clinical feasibility of this multi-modality approach. Results demonstrate high levels of VB9VD2 T cell and NKT cell cytotoxicity against tumour cell lines in combination treatment with chemotherapeutic agents. Pretreatment with low concentrations of chemotherapy sensitized tumour cells to rapid killing by these effector cells and levels of cytotoxicity approached 90%. Zoledronate pre-treatment of tumour cells induced potent lytic responses by VB9VD2 T cells and also enhanced chemotherapy-induced sensitization resulting in almost 100% cell death of tumour targets in some cases. Mechanisms of cytotoxicity involved a range of pathways, including perforin, TRAIL and FasL, some of which were instigated by the effects of chemotherapy or zoledronate exposure. In vivo migration studies of intravenously administered VB9VD2 T cells show for the first time preferential movement of these cells to large organs and small tumour deposits, but the inability to infiltrate large tumour masses. In conclusion, the administration of NKT cells or VB9VD2 T cells at suitable intervals after chemotherapy and/or zoledronate in a cell based multi-modality therapy approach, may substantially increase anti-tumour activities in a range of solid tumour malignancies and improve patient outcomes. The anticipated benefits of this research are combinations of cancer therapies that are not only more effective than those currently available, but also reduce toxicity associated with conventional treatments.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158548</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Systematic Marine Reserve Design</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Romola Russell</field><field name="description">Since the first reserve selection algorithm was developed in the early 1980s, systematic approaches to reserve design have attracted widespread support due to their ability to identify repeatable and efficient solutions to conservation planning problems. Yet there has been limited application of these methods to the problem of designing reserve systems for biodiversity conservation in the marine environment. In my dissertation research, I apply systematic methods to examine four fundamental issues in marine reserve system design. These issues consider how conservation planning outcomes are influenced when design constraints such as spatial compactness, efficiency, economic costs and incremental reserve establishment are formulated as part of the reserve design problem. First, I consider the trade-offs between spatial design and cost efficiency. In particular, I examine how well marine reserve systems can satisfy the design requirement to minimise the degree of fragmentation whilst minimising reserve system cost. In this case cost refers to the number of sites required to achieve biodiversity conservation objectives. The second issue is the inefficiency of ad hoc marine reserve system design. In terrestrial systems, ad hoc reserve design has been shown to produce inefficient reserve systems, limiting opportunities to achieve conservation targets. I examine how efficiently South Australia&#146;s existing marine reserves contribute to quantitative conservation targets and introduce a new measure of irreplaceability. This metric reflects the potential value of a site&#146;s contribution to reservation goals, by assessing whether a site is selected more than could be expected from chance alone. Sites selected as often as would be expected by chance, fail to contribute to the design of efficient marine reserve systems and represent an opportunity cost. The third issue addresses the demands on reserve systems to achieve both conservation and socio-economic objectives. Options for the design of marine reserve systems, which achieve better economic outcomes for commercial users without compromising conservation targets, are examined using a cost function that serves to make trade&#150;offs early in the design process. The fourth issue is one of shifting targets and incremental reserve design. The problem was most recently highlighted with the rezoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, where the amount of no-take areas increased from 5% to over 30% but the original zoning arrangements were left in place. The consequence this has on the efficiency of the final marine reserve system is examined when different starting targets are used as the base. Each issue is examined by formulating planning scenarios using data for South Australia&#146;s state waters as a case study. The marine reserve systems are configured using the mathematical optimisation program MARXAN to examine the complex trade-offs of conservation planning problems. The program offers the flexibility to incorporate new approaches and developing theory in marine conservation into the formal statement of the reserve design problem. The results offer some important insights for the future of marine reserve system design. These include 1) efficient representation of biodiversity is only part of the reserve design problem, with small increases in reserve system cost reported as a trade-off for more spatially compact marine reserve systems, 2) despite spanning less than 4% of South Australian state waters, the existing ad hoc marine reserves presented considerable opportunity costs that did not improve even when conservation targets were increased. Hence ad hoc reserve selection is likely to constrain effective conservation of marine biodiversity by compromising the ability to select more suitable sites, 3) integrating conservation and socio-economic objectives presents opportunities to design representative, efficient and practical marine reserve systems that minimise potential loss to commercial users with only small increases to the areal extent of the reserve system and 4) incrementally changing target levels of reservation has a minor affect on the efficiency of the final reserve system, though is likely to influence which planning units are in the final reserve system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">conservation planning</field><field name="subject">marine reserves</field><field name="subject">decision theory</field><field name="subject">marine protected areas</field><field name="subject">efficiency</field><field name="subject">irreplaceability</field><field name="subject">management strategy evaluation</field><field name="subject">South Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157993</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formal concept analysis applications to requirements engineering and design</field><field name="creator">Tilley, Thomas Alan</field><field name="description">Currently, the bulk of applications of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) in software engineering have focussed on software maintenance and re-engineering. In this thesis we broaden the approach by applying FCA to a number of early-phase activities within the software engineering life-cycle. With respect to the requirements engineering phase, a case study is presented comparing two class hierarchies that model aspects of a mass-transit railway ticketing system. The first hierarchy was produced for an existing Object-Z specification of the system while the second was derived using FCA. Contrasting the two hierarchies revealed that they were essentially the same, however, the differences highlighted specification artefacts in the existing hierarchy. With respect to the design phase, the thesis discusses the use of FCA for the navigation and visualisation of Formal Specifications written in Z. In response to the continued call for formal methods tool support, we implement and explore a prototype specification browser that exploits the abstractions afforded by FCA. The research hypothesis is an integrated architecture for navigating formal specifications using FCA. This architecture is realised using ZML and ToscanaJ to produce a practical research tool. The thesis also includes the first broad survey of FCA in the domain of software engineering and an FCA-based methodology for surveying academic literature in general.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280111 Conceptual Modelling</field><field name="subject">700199 Computer software and services not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">formal concept analysis</field><field name="subject">requirements analysis</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">software engineering</field><field name="subject">formal specification</field><field name="subject">Z</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157991</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tannin Protein Interactions in Ruminants</field><field name="creator">Osborne, Nicholas John</field><field name="description">The major antinutritive factor in Leucaena for ruminants is condensed tannin (CT). CT bind proteins, incurring a negative effect on protein utilisation. The two major factors affecting the ability of CT to bind protein have been purported to be CT size and the pH of the reaction environment. To test these hypotheses the protein precipitating capacities of CT extracted from four promising Leucaena genotypes, L. leucocephala (K636), L. pallida (CQ3439), L. trichandra (CPI46568), and L. collinsii (OFI52/88) were assessed. L. leucocephala had approximately half the ability to precipitate protein on a g/g basis than L. pallida or L. trichandra while L. collinsii gave no measurable ability to precipitate protein (reaction environment=pH 5.0). Increasing or decreasing the pH of the reaction solution away from pH 5.0 (the isoelectric point of the protein) reduced the ability of CT from all the species to precipitate protein; the decrease being higher a pH 2.5 than at pH 7.5. At pH 2.5 L. leucocephala CT completely lost its capacity to precipitate protein. The relatively poor ability of L. leucocephala CT to bind protein at pH&#146;s approximating those at the abomasum suggests L. leucocephala may have the greatest potential of the four Leucaena&#146;s tested for increasing the extent of feed protein escaping ruminant degradation for later release and digestion in the small intestine, hence increasing the total amount of protein absorbed by ruminants. CT fractions from each Leucaena were also separated into individual CT&#146;s, by size-exclusion chromatography and examined for protein precipitating capacity. In general it was found that the larger sized CT of the accessions L. pallida and L. trichandra could precipitate more protein than the smaller sized CT. This pattern was not found for L. leucocephala.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">condensed tannins</field><field name="subject">tannin-protein complex</field><field name="subject">isoelectric point</field><field name="subject">bypass protein</field><field name="subject">fodder tree-legume</field><field name="subject">Leucaena</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157989</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Skills and Techniques for Attribution Retraining (STAR)</field><field name="creator">Minniti, Antoinette Marie</field><field name="description">Attributions are explanations that individuals give to describe or account for their perception of an event or outcome. The complex nature of sport settings has provided a challenging context for researchers to understand the impact of causal attributions. The purpose of this research was to develop Skills and Techniques for Attribution Retraining (STAR), particularly for application to the athletic domain. Study 1 was conducted to evaluate attributions for perceived success and failure outcomes of multi-event athletes in a field setting. This study contributed to sport attribution literature in that minimal research has previously examined athletes&#146; causal explanations in sport utilising globality and intentionality dimensions. Also, prior research in sport has not yet explored the stability of attributions across different events for the same athlete. Five decathletes and one heptathlete (18&#150;62 years old) completed the Revised Sport Attributional Style Scale (R-SASS; Hanrahan &amp; Gross, 2000) following each event and for the overall competition at the Queensland Multi-Event Championship. Performance ratings and scores on internality, globality, stability, intentionality, and personal and external controllability dimensions were examined. Analyses revealed that multi-event athletes tended to make different explanations across events. Dimensional scores for each event did not necessarily reflect participants&#146; overall perceptions of the competition. However, similar categories of attributions tended to relate to specific dimensions for individual athletes (e.g., &#147;motivation&#148; &#150; indicated three times by a participant &#150; was associated with more global and personally controllable attributions). Performance ratings were significantly correlated with greater stability, globality, and intentionality. Study 2 was an exploratory study that was conducted to examine athletes&#146; causal attributions. The qualitative approach for this study was unique, as previous researchers have typically utilised questionnaires to assess athletes&#146; explanations for success and failure. Interviews were conducted with ten elite triathletes (five males, five females; aged 18-30 years). Following inductive content analyses, results indicated that the athletes provided more explanations for success than failure and fewer external factors for success. However, in contrast to existing learned helplessness (LH), self-efficacy, and attributional models of attribution retraining (AR), athletes did not cite ability as a reason for success. While the majority of participants described negative effects of attributions for unsuccessful situations, analyses revealed a variety of factors led to the same type of effect. For example, &#145;cramps/stitch&#146;, &#145;haven&#146;t done the hard work&#146;, and &#145;over-training&#146; attributions all led to the effect &#145;convincing self of having a bad race&#146;. A minority of athletes stated that explanations following an unsuccessful situation led to positive effects. The purpose of Study 3 was to compare across current AR models (as cited above: Abramson, Seligman, &amp; Teasdale, 1978; Bandura, 1986; Weiner, 1986). In particular, the study was conducted to test the effectiveness of AR where students were given persuasive feedback that was designed to either enhance or decrease performance. Participants were undergraduate, introductory psychology students (N = 61). Students were given two sets of three puzzle cube tasks, and were asked to construct puzzle cube pieces to match each of six shapes provided. Some tasks were impossible and were included to assess persistence. Following the initial set of tasks, students received AR intervention. Participants completed the R-SASS following both sets of tasks. Performance measures included students&#146; ratings of perceived performance, time to complete possible puzzle cube tasks, and time spent on impossible tasks. Findings revealed a slight trend toward the ability of AR models to change students&#146; attributions. Overall, no AR model was found to significantly impact changes in attributions or performance more than another model. Participants&#146; open-ended explanations for success and failure suggested that individuals were affected by the intervention to varying degrees. Relationships were found between performance and attributions, particularly with respect to internality, stability, and globality. Implications of this research are that competitors may benefit from AR to learn adaptive ways to explain performance, as long as the intervention is designed to complement their needs and attributional tendencies. Also, athletes may be able to develop skills to translate causal explanations for unsuccessful experiences into positive outcomes. Suggestions for future research include testing the utility of skills and techniques for AR in a meaningful environment and over a number of sessions. Specifically, following assessment of athletes&#146; causal attributions, interventions would be based on existing AR models and ideally occur both on and off the field throughout the competitive season.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Elite</field><field name="subject">performance</field><field name="subject">qualitative</field><field name="subject">interviews</field><field name="subject">perceived outcomes</field><field name="subject">multi-sport athletes</field><field name="subject">R-SASS</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157990</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The feasibility and cost-effectiveness of a novel telepaediatric service in Queensland</field><field name="creator">Smith, Anthony Carl</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1114 Paediatrics and Reproductive Medicine</field><field name="subject">telehealth</field><field name="subject">telemedicine</field><field name="subject">online health</field><field name="subject">telepaediatrics</field><field name="subject">telepediatrics</field><field name="subject">paediatrics</field><field name="subject">pediatrics</field><field name="subject">outreach</field><field name="subject">health service delivery</field><field name="subject">cost-effectiveness</field><field name="subject">clinical effectiveness</field><field name="subject">rural and remote communities</field><field name="subject">outpatient services</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157987</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling diffraction in optical interconnects</field><field name="creator">Petrovic, Novak S.</field><field name="description">Short-distance digital communication links, between chips on a circuit board, or between different circuit boards for example, have traditionally been built by using electrical interconnects -- metallic tracks and wires. Recent technological advances have resulted in improvements in the speed of information processing, but have left electrical interconnects intact, thus creating a serious communication problem. Free-space optical interconnects, made up of arrays of vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers, microlenses, and photodetectors, could be used to solve this problem. If free-space optical interconnects are to successfully replace electrical interconnects, they have to be able to support large rates of information transfer with high channel densities. The biggest obstacle in the way of reaching these requirements is laser beam diffraction. There are three approaches commonly used to model the effects of laser beam diffraction in optical interconnects: one could pursue the path of solving the diffraction integral directly, one could apply stronger approximations with some loss of accuracy of the results, or one could cleverly reinterpret the diffraction problem altogether. None of the representatives of the three categories of existing solutions qualified for our purposes. The main contribution of this dissertation consist of, first, formulating the mode expansion method, and, second, showing that it outperforms all other methods previously used for modelling diffraction in optical interconnects. The mode expansion method allows us to obtain the optical field produced by the diffraction of arbitrary laser beams at empty apertures, phase-shifting optical elements, or any combinations thereof, regardless of the size, shape, position, or any other parameters either of the incident optical field or the observation plane. The mode expansion method enables us to perform all this without any reference or use of the traditional Huygens-Kirchhoff-Fresnel diffraction integrals. When using the mode expansion method, one replaces the incident optical field and the diffracting optical element by an effective beam, possibly containing higher-order transverse modes, so that the ultimate effects of diffraction are equivalently expressed through the complex-valued modal weights. By using the mode expansion method, one represents both the incident and the resultant optical fields in terms of an orthogonal set of functions, and finds the unknown parameters from the condition that the two fields have to be matched at each surface on their propagation paths. Even though essentially a numerical process, the mode expansion method can produce very accurate effective representations of the diffraction fields quickly and efficiently, usually by using no more than about a dozen expanding modes. The second tier of contributions contained in this dissertation is on the subject of the analysis and design of microchannel free-space optical interconnects. In addition to the proper characterisation of the design model, we have formulated several optical interconnect performance parameters, most notably the signal-to-noise ratio, optical carrier-to-noise ratio, and the space-bandwidth product, in a thorough and insightful way that has not been published previously. The proper calculation of those performance parameters, made possible by the mode expansion method, was then performed by using experimentally-measured fields of the incident vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser beams. After illustrating the importance of the proper way of modelling diffraction in optical interconnects, we have shown how to improve the optical interconnect performance by changing either the interconnect optical design, or by careful selection of the design parameter values. We have also suggested a change from the usual `square' to a novel `hexagonal' packing of the optical interconnect channels, in order to alleviate the negative diffraction effects. Finally, the optical interconnect tolerance to lateral misalignment, in the presence of multimodal incident laser beams was studied for the first time, and it was shown to be acceptable only as long as most of the incident optical power is emitted in the fundamental Gaussian mode.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">291702 Optical and Photonic Systems</field><field name="subject">700302 Telecommunications</field><field name="subject">free-space optical interconnect</field><field name="subject">diffraction</field><field name="subject">modal expansion</field><field name="subject">orthogonal expansion</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157988</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE TYRANNY OF SINGULARITY: MASCULINITY AS IDEOLOGY AND &#147;HEGEMISING&#148; DISCOURSE</field><field name="creator">Frey, Ronald Michael</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to examine the various definitional strategies involved in and underlying the use of the term &#145;masculinity&#146; in social science literature, with a particular emphasis on psychodynamic literature, and to propose an additional approach (via the metaphor of the &#145;lens&#146; (borrowed from Bem, 1993)) to understanding masculinity as ideology in Althusser&#146;s (1971; 1984) sense of a discourse or narrative which establishes subjectivity and identity. It suggests that masculinity could be usefully viewed as a certain type of discourse which attempts to exercise a hegemony over a more variegated and nuanced personality for the purpose of the attachment of the individual (usually male) to larger social structures and relations, in this case, to the gendered social relations of patriarchy. The idea for the thesis arose out of the writer&#146;s dissatisfaction with current definitional strategies of masculinity employed in social science research and his perceived need to provide a more complex definition of the term &#145;masculinity&#146;, which would highlight its meaning for individual men whilst simultaneously placing that meaning in the wider meaning-generating structures of Western culture. It also arose from a growing frustration with all sections of the so-called men&#146;s movement&#146;s attempts to delineate a type of &#145;masculinity&#146; which is respectful of the rights and needs of women and children. Finally, it particularly arose out of the researcher&#146;s own interest to explore the nature of identity narratives within contemporary Western culture. Chapter One explores these problems and provides key definitions of the important terms of the thesis, including the neological verb, &#145;to hegemise,&#146; by which I refer to the process of attempting, but never entirely successfully, to establish hegemony. It also deals with other definitional questions such as the definition of patriarchy against the suggestion of the existence of multiple patriarchies (Petersen, 1998). The thesis is organised broadly into two sections. The first section, contained in Chapters One through Four, deals with what I have labelled (following suggestions by de Certeau, 1984) current &#147;definitional strategies&#148; employed in discussions of masculinity in the social sciences, with Chapters One and Two providing an overview of these strategies, whilst Chapters Three and Four take three of the six strategies identified and examines them in depth through their exemplary use in key literature from three psychodynamic schools of thought. These definitional strategies are, firstly, the three which are not explored in depth: 1) the simple reduction of masculinity to any male behaviour (which I believe is very rarely employed), 2) the argument from statistics (so that whatever men can be demonstrated to do, have, think, and so on, more often than women becomes an example of masculinity), and 3) the argument from key exemplars, (such as John Wayne), real or imaginary (again, such as John Wayne). Secondly, the three definitional strategies which are chosen for more extended treatment, 1) the strategy of definition by deferral to other, equally problematic terms (as in the works of Freud, discussed in Chapter Two), 2) the use of the process or results of presumed male child development (the views of the object relations psychodynamic theory as delineated by Nancy Chodorow, and to a lesser extent, Dorothy Dinnerstein, discussed in Chapter Three), and 3) reliance on common understandings (Jung, also discussed in Chapter Three). This last strategy is a kind of definition by default, in that the writer fails to provide a definition, assuming a common cultural background with the reader (and seems to be a very common strategy). It is my argument, reinforced by a detailed examination of certain key relevant texts, selected for both their influence and timeliness in the social sciences, that the use of any of these strategies inevitably involves the writer or researcher in contradiction and confusion. As this entire thesis is about the definitional strategies employed when using the term, &#145;masculinity,&#146; no specific definition is provided of masculinity in the opening chapters of the thesis. However, due attention is paid in Chapter Two to Connell&#146;s (1987; 1995) notion that there are actually &#145;multiple masculinities,&#146; a definitional strategy, I argue, not without its own confusions. Within Connell&#146;s understanding of masculinity, this thesis focuses only on notions of &#145;hegemonic masculinity&#146;. The final five chapters of the thesis sketch a further approach to masculinity on the basis of considering masculinity as a specific type of identity narrative. Chapters Five, Six and Seven provide the grounding for such a consideration through an examination of the nature of identity narratives generally, and Chapters Eight and Nine apply this grounding specifically to masculinity, and, in the case of Chapter Nine, to research about men. Chapter Five delineates the key term &#145;identity&#146;, and separates it from the concept of the &#145;self&#146;, a term with which it is often, but not always, conflated, whilst comparing both terms, &#145;self&#146; and &#145;identity&#146;, on the one hand to the Foucauldian idea of subjectivity and on the other hand, to the Freudian and Lacanian notion of the ego. Chapter Five argues that identity can be meaningfully separated from the self by two markers, 1) its basically moral nature, which in turn 2) arises out of its association with social structures and social discourses. Although no argument is made either for a singular self or a &#147;true&#148; self, it is argued that the human experience of the self and the identity is that they are often in conflict, and the &#145;self&#146; is often experienced as being an unsuccessful copy or diminished form of the identity (or identities). This experience signals what I have called &#145;the Ambassadorial function&#146; of the identity; that is, its ability to represent and commend, as well as prescribe and command, cultural norms and expectations for an individual&#146;s personality to the self. Chapter Five suggests that whilst the number of selves in a particular culture may be close to infinite (in that one body may contain many selves), the number of identities prescribed by a given culture which uses identity narratives may be multiple, but quite finite. Chapters Six and Seven explore the human attraction, at least in modernist Western cultures, to identity narratives, and suggests that their current cultural importance arises out of both personal need and social compulsion. In order to establish personal motivations for the adoption of the identity, Chapter Six takes a necessary detour through conceptions of agency as they appear in the work of Anthony Giddens (1979; 1984), Rom Harre and his associates (particularly in Harre&#146;s discussion of &#145;positioning theory&#146;, Harre and van Langenhove, 1999a) and in the recent work of Judith Butler (1997). Each of these asserts the possibility of human agency against some post-modernist interpretations of Foucault, Althusser, and others which suggest agency is entirely an artefact of discourse (an interpretation denied by Foucault himself (Foucault, 1994/2000, p. 399)). Although I do not believe any of these accounts provide a particularly satisfying notion of agency, they do make it plausible to consider the possibility that identities take on their compelling nature because they provide an answer to individual concerns, as well as the role they play in the construction of human subjectivity, and of course, it can also be argued that some of these individual concerns are themselves created by social subjectivities. Chapter Seven examines this collusion of interest which occurs in modernist Western cultures which promote the adoption of identity narratives. Based on theoretical work by Otto Rank (1936a; 1936b), Ernst Becker (1962/1977), Theresa Brennan (1993; 2000), as well as on research by Theweleit (1977/1987; 1978/1989) and Foxhall (1994; 1995), it suggests that identities serve to protect a person from overwhelming fears of mortality, change and the flow of life (see also Goodchild, 1996). As a result of these fears, an individual is primed to adopt narratives which attach them to larger, less changeable social wholes, whether these narratives are of a collective religious nature, or whether, as in the case of modernist culture, they are identities. These fears can then be exploited to instil identities which serve wider, and not necessarily equitous, social purposes. Chapter Seven concludes, however, that such a project is always unsuccessful, for as Butler (1993, p. 2) states, &#145;Bodies never quite comply with the norms by which their materialization is impelled.&#146; No strategy, however clever, can solidify the processes of flow. Chapter Eight presents the case for considering masculinity as a type of identity narrative, which, because of its relationship to biological sex and gender, reflects the social relationships between the genders in modernist cultures (the assumption that there are only two genders acknowledges a cultural belief, and not the writer&#146;s own assumptions about gender). It suggests that it makes sense to think of masculinity as an identity discourse to which both men and women are initiated as they come to understand the specific speaking conditions under which this discourse must be appropriated (these occur more often for men than for women). It further proposes limiting the use of the term masculinity to those societies which have two necessary pre-conditions; 1) they rely on identity narratives generally, and 2) they are patriarchal. It argues that many societies which are/have been patriarchal do not/did not have a concept of masculinity, and men exercised their privilege over women and children through other forms, such as in the social roles they played. (For example, Connell, 1993, p. 604, cites classical China as having a patriarchal, yet non-identity based culture.) Chapter Eight argues that to refer to men&#146;s conceptions of masculinity in these societies is to import an anachronistic term into discussions of those societies&#146; conceptions of manhood. Chapter Eight further suggests that the &#147;speaking conditions&#148; for the employment of masculinity must be learned by the members of a culture, and that men&#146;s everyday behaviour is often non-masculine; in fact, I suggest it is usually non-masculine unless the male is made aware that the situation requires the production of the masculine identity narrative. Following suggestions from narrative therapy (for example, Jenkins, 1990; 1996; White, 1991; 1992; C. White and Denborough, 1998), I believe greater hope for promoting equity towards women and children and respect for diversity amongst men can be achieved by focusing on those occasions when a male is not &#147;speaking&#148; masculinity than for reform of masculinity, which in my view, remains locked into its relationship to patriarchal social relations. In this sense, I present further arguments which I believe buttress the case already made by MacInnes (1998) that the abolition of the masculine identity narrative totally (and perhaps gender narratives generally) is more desirable than the reform of masculinity. Chapter Nine briefly illustrates the application of this approach to researching masculinity through the understandings of the development of the masculine identity narrative generated by two male focus groups using the &#145;memory work&#146; methodology pioneered by Frigga Haug (1987; 1992a) and extended by June Crawford and others (1992). In all, this thesis contributes to the current debate on the nature of masculinity by seriously considering the implications of the links masculinity provides to patriarchal social relationships as an identity narrative. The specificity of these links, as well as their deeper functioning within human life have, to date, been largely unexplored in the literature on men. The thesis explores these links through the use of some of the literature which first brought the problems identities seek to resolve to academic and therapeutic attention (such as the work of Rank and Becker). Further, in proposing an approach to masculinity limited by cultural constraints (that is, patriarchy and the general presence of identity narratives), the thesis facilitates a potential shift in the literature from approaching masculinity via one of the definitional strategies to a more focused definition, which allows one to delineate when a man is being masculine and when a man is not being masculine. As such, this allows for a re-emergence and perhaps a re-appreciation of the diversity and multiplicity that lies not only between individuals, but also within each individual&#146;s life and experiences.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">men</field><field name="subject">masculinity</field><field name="subject">men's issues</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">gender studies</field><field name="subject">psychoanalysis</field><field name="subject">Freud</field><field name="subject">Jung</field><field name="subject">object relations theory</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">self</field><field name="subject">agency</field><field name="subject">subjectivity</field><field name="subject">Foucault</field><field name="subject">Judith Butler</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157986</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations into Passive and Active Microstrip Antenna Arrays for Power Combining Applications</field><field name="creator">Tsai, Feng-Chi Eddie</field><field name="description">There has been a rapid growth of terrestrial and satellite communications in the last few decades of the 20th century. This has resulted in a heavy congestion of low microwave bands and has been a major driving force for exploring the upper microwave and millimeter-wave frequencies. One of the main requirements for a successful shift to the new frequency spectrum is the availability of high power solid-state transmitters. Solid-state devices such as diodes or transistors have been able to meet such demands when their output signals are combined using space-level power combining methods that avoid conduction losses, which become pronounced at millimeter wave frequencies. In this thesis, theoretical and experimental investigations are carried out into the spatial power combiners (SPCs) which employ active planar arrays formed by transistor amplifiers whose input and output ports are equipped with planar radiating elements. The SPC structures include the reflection-type combiner using the tile configuration of planar array and the transmission-type combiner using tile or tray configurations of planar arrays. The frequency bands chosen for the designing and testing of prototypes are X- and Ku-band. The first stage of the investigation concerns the 10 GHz reflection-type power combiner structure formed by a phased planar microstrip reflectarray (MRA) of 37-element dual-feed aperture coupled microstrip patch antennas equipped with open-circuit stubs as phasing components. The experimental tests reveal poor radiation performance and hence poor power combining efficiency of this structure. These results indicated the need for theoretical investigations into the operation of this type of SPC. The study of the unit cell of this power combiner reveals that the phase of an open-circuit stub does not increase linearly as a function of the stub length and its range is limited to less than (about is required for proper functioning). This finding, forms the basis for extending the investigations into alternative phasing mechanisms of a MRA which would offer a phasing range exceeding . A phasing mechanism exploiting variable size stacked patches is chosen. In order to accurately determine the phasing of the reflected wave, a theory based on an equivalent unit cell waveguide approach (WGA) is proposed and developed. The proposed theory is computationally efficient and is proven to be accurate compared with benchmark results published by other researchers. Following the verification, an offset feed 161-element two-layer printed MRA prototype with patches of variable size is designed and developed for operation in Ku-band. The test results aim at verifying the validity of applying a unit cell WGA to designing passive and active MRAs. The next investigations, which are presented in the thesis concern increasing operational bandwidth of the transmission-type SPC in tile configuration. The designs presented so far in the open literatures were based on edge-feed microstrip patch antennas as radiating elements of individual active stages and featured a narrow-band performance. In order to overcome this shortcoming, stacked patch (SP) microstrip antennas as receiving and transmitting elements in an active transmitarray (TXA) are proposed. For the aim of testing the proposed concept, a 16-element SP TXA is designed for operation in X-band. Two identical hard horn antennas with an approximately uniform field across the aperture for signal launching and collecting complete the design and development of this space-level power combiner. The performance of the developed device is assessed experimentally and an increased operational bandwidth is demonstrated. The final structure being investigated in the thesis project is the transmission-type SPC in tray configuration. This power combining structure employs a travelling wave antenna of uniplanar quasi-Yagi type as a radiating element to achieve broad-band operation. The investigated SPC is formed by seven trays of uniplanar quasi-Yagi antenna. In order to achieve uniform and in-phase excitation of individual trays, which is required to obtain high power combining efficiency, hard horn antennas and Schiffman phase shifters are employed in the design of this space-level combiner. The proposed device is developed and its performance is assessed through experiments. The work performed as part of this Ph.D. thesis project has resulted in 5 journal papers and 11 refereed conference papers. This acceptance rate supports the claim of the originality and significance of the research undertaken as part of the thesis project.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">electromagnetic modelling</field><field name="subject">microstrip patch array</field><field name="subject">multilayer patch antenna</field><field name="subject">rectangular waveguide</field><field name="subject">reflectarray</field><field name="subject">amplifier</field><field name="subject">antenna array</field><field name="subject">quasi-Yagi</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157985</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scramjet Experiments using Radical Farming</field><field name="creator">Odam, Judy</field><field name="description">Scramjet engines are the focus of considerable interest for propulsion in the hypersonic flow regime. One of the serious technical challenges for developing scramjets is reducing the skin friction drag on the engine. The combustion chamber, in particular, is a major contributor to the skin friction drag because of the high density of the flow through that region. This investigation focuses on reducing the combustion chamber skin friction drag by minimising the surface area and size of the combustion chamber and by employing a novel approach to accomplishing combustion. The first design criterion is addressed by using a single internal-combustor scramjet configuration, as opposed to multiple external combustors, and by injecting the fuel on the intake to reduce the mixing length required in the combustor. The second design criterion refers to the use of a new technique called radical farming. This uses the highly two-dimensional nature of the flow through the engine, which is created by deliberately ingesting the leading edge shocks, to achieve combustion at lower mean static pressures and temperatures than generally expected. A simplified approximate theoretical analysis of the radical farming concept is presented. Experiments were conducted in the T4 free-piston shock tunnel on a scramjet model with a single rectangular constant cross-sectional area combustion chamber. Pressure measurements were taken along the centreline of the intake, combustion chamber and thrust surface and across the model width at three locations. Gaseous hydrogen fuel was injected halfway along the intake at a range of equivalence ratios between zero and one. The combustion chamber height was varied from 20mm to 32mm, which varied the contraction ratio of the engine from 4.1 to 2.9. The experiments were conducted at a stagnation enthalpy of either 3MJ/kg or 4MJ/kg. The nominal 3MJ/kg condition corresponds to Mach 7.9 flight at an altitude of 24km. The majority of the 4MJ/kg experiments were conducted at a nominal condition corresponding to Mach 9.1 flight at an altitude of 32km. A small number of 4MJ/kg experiments were conducted at simulated flight altitudes of between 30 and 38km; the flight Mach number for these experiments was approximately 9.0. Thrust was calculated by integrating the centreline pressure distribution over the area of the thrust surface, assuming that the pressure at any axial location was constant across the engine width. These experimental thrust values were compared with theoretical estimates obtained using a one-dimensional analysis and a quasi-two-dimensional analysis. The comparison provided an indication of the level of completion of combustion in the experiments. The difference in thrust produced as a result of combusting fuel was examined by plotting the incremental specific impulse against equivalence ratio. Experimental and theoretical results agreed best at the higher equivalence ratios. Turbulent boundary layer separation correlations were used to provide reasonable estimates for the equivalence ratio at which the flow choked. The drag on the internal flowpath of the scramjet engine was estimated using the quasi-two-dimensional analysis. This drag estimate was combined with the experimental thrust measurements to provide estimates of the net specific impulse. Positive net specific impulse estimates were obtained above a certain minimum equivalence ratio, which depended on the contraction ratio and the test condition. The engine performance was observed to be highly dependent on the two-dimensional shock structure within the engine. Thrust and specific impulse were observed to decrease with increasing simulated flight altitude, as expected. Positive net specific impulse estimates were obtained at equivalence ratios of approximately one for simulated flight altitudes below 35km. Assuming complete combustion and that an equivalence ratio of one can be reached, the configuration considered in the present study can theoretically reach a net specific impulse of approximately 1000s at the 3MJ/kg condition and 500s at the 4MJ/kg condition. These numbers provide a promising testimonial for the use of this configuration, with modifications, as a more efficient alternative to rocket engines.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">scramjet</field><field name="subject">supersonic combustion</field><field name="subject">radical farming</field><field name="subject">hypersonic propulsion</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157983</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Socio-economic evaluation of forestry development opportunities for Wik people on Cape York Peninsula</field><field name="creator">Venn, Tyron James</field><field name="description">Wik, Wik-Way and Kugu people (Wik people) in Aurukun Shire on Cape York Peninsula (CYP) are among the most socio-economically disadvantaged groups in Australia. While Wik people are presently reliant on government work for welfare programs for income, elders have a vision of economic independence and self-reliance. The large area of native Darwin stringybark (Eucalyptus tetrodonta) forest on traditional Wik land is a potential engine for economic development, which could provide meaningful employment, and contribute to other Wik socio-economic objectives, including facilitating population decentralisation and consolidation of cultural obligations to manage country through provision of on country employment, reducing welfare dependency and expenditure on timber purchases from outside CYP, and increasing income and skill levels in the community. A large proportion of the higher-quality timber resource on traditional Wik land is situated on bauxite mining leases and the current practice is to clear, windrow and burn this timber prior to commencement of mining. A Wik native forest timber industry could make use of this wasted high-quality timber resource. The objectives of this thesis were to: determine the property rights of Wik people to the timber resource on their traditional land; assess whether forestry operations in Darwin stringybark forests in the study area are likely to be financially viable; and generate a suite of optimal timber utilisation strategies for Wik people, subject to cultural, ecological and economic constraints. This required economic research in the areas of indigenous property rights, private and social costs and benefits of forestry, timber markets, and evaluation and application of economic analysis techniques for appraisal of forestry development opportunities. A social cost-benefit analysis of the privately optimal timber utilisation policies has also been performed to support the decision-making of government policy-makers. This research project was a demanding and complex undertaking, not least because the research was being performed in a unique and diverse indigenous cultural environment where there is a need to respect cultural and research ethics protocols, where formal participatory research methods are inappropriate and where gatekeepers are particularly zealous about &#145;protecting&#146; Wik people from &#145;outsiders&#146;. In addition, the property rights of Wik people to timber resources had never previously been analysed methodically, timber inventory and timber market information was lacking for CYP, and there are difficulties in transferring parameter estimates from the industrial hardwood timber industry of Australia to culturally appropriate indigenous operations on CYP. A critical research step was to develop a rapport with Wik people and gain an insight into their forestry objectives, through a number of visits to Aurukun Shire and informal discussions with elders on country. The property rights of Wik people to timber resources have been assessed by reviewing Federal and State Government legislation, court rulings, regional development policies and the Queensland Code of Practice for Native Forest Timber Production on State-owned lands. A timber inventory was conducted over 580,000 ha of Darwin stringybark forest, individual-tree volume and taper models were developed, and a geographical information system was used in estimation of harvestable timber volume and its spatial distribution. To facilitate information transfer to Wik people, expertise was gained in the use of forest visualisation software to pictorially display timber inventory data. A review of literature and discussions with experts identified technically feasible timber processing opportunities for CYP timbers. An informal telephone and in-person survey of 46 businesses, local councils and government agencies in north and south Queensland and the Northern Territory provided market information about CYP timbers. Concepts of a culturally appropriate working week and culturally appropriate rate of production were developed to assist the estimation of cost structures for a Wik timber industry, based on cost estimates for non-indigenous Australian hardwood forestry enterprises that had been obtained from discussion with forestry experts and &#145;grey literature&#146;. Generation and evaluation of a suite of privately optimal timber utilisation strategies for Wik people has been supported by the development of a mixed-integer goal programming (GP) model using the GAMS software package. The social analysis of the privately optimal strategies has been performed by adjusting private net present values (NPV) estimated by the GP model with shadow prices and transfer payments. In particular, a carbon model has been developed to estimate the value of carbon emitted by the Wik timber industry. The GP model analysis suggests that a Wik timber industry can generate a positive financial NPV if seed funding of at least $0.5 M is available. In general, privately optimal forestry strategies for Wik people generated by the GP model utilise relatively low-technology equipment, including portable sawmills and air-drying sheds, and produce undressed timber products such as structural timber. This contrasts strongly with Wik visions of an industry selling mostly unprocessed logs or woodchips and non-indigenous representatives of Wik people favouring the manufacture of high-value strip-flooring and furniture. The social analysis of privately optimal timber utilisation strategies reveals that social NPVs are much higher than financial NPVs, even when accounting for the costs of ecosystem services foregone by logging native forest. The establishment of a culturally appropriate Wik timber industry can be expected to generate net social benefits for Australia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">720204 Industry policy</field><field name="subject">340213 Economic Development and Growth</field><field name="subject">340202 Environment and Resource Economics</field><field name="subject">communal forestry</field><field name="subject">goal programming</field><field name="subject">Aurukun community</field><field name="subject">native title</field><field name="subject">indigenous land rights</field><field name="subject">native forest management</field><field name="subject">timber markets</field><field name="subject">volume and taper modelling</field><field name="subject">timber inventory</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157984</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations into Smart Antennas for CDMA Wireless Systems</field><field name="creator">Durrani, Salman</field><field name="description">Over the last few years, wireless cellular communications has experienced rapid growth in the demand for provision of high data rate wireless multimedia services. This fact motivates the need to find ways to improve the spectrum efficiency of wireless communication systems. Smart or adaptive antennas have emerged as a promising technology to enhance the spectrum efficiency of present and future wireless communications systems by exploiting the spatial domain. The aim of this thesis is to investigate smart antenna applications for Direct Sequence Code Division Multiple Access (DS-CDMA) systems. CDMA is chosen as the platform for this thesis work since it has been adopted as the air-interface technology by the Third Generation (3G) wireless communication systems. The main role of smart antennas is to mitigate Multiple Access Interference (MAI) by beamforming (i.e. spatial filtering) operation. Therefore, irrespective of a particular wireless communication system, it is important to consider whether a chosen array configuration will enable optimal performance. In this thesis an initial assessment is carried out considering linear and circular array of dipoles, that can be part of a base station antenna system. A unified and systematic approach is proposed to analyse and compare the interference rejection capabilities of the two array configurations in terms of the Signal to Interference Ratio (SIR) at the array output. The theoretical framework is then extended to include the effect of mutual coupling, which is modelled using both analytical and simulation methods. Results show that when the performance is averaged over all angles of arrival and mutual coupling is negligible, linear arrays show similar performance as circular arrays. Thus in the remaining part of this thesis, only linear arrays are considered. In order to properly evaluate the performance of smart antenna systems, a realistic channel model is required that takes into account both temporal and spatial propagation characteristics of the wireless channel. In this regard, a novel parameterized physical channel model is proposed in this thesis. The new model incorporates parameters such as user mobility, azimuth angle of arrival, angle spread and Doppler frequency, which have critical influence on the performance of smart antennas. A mathematical formulation of the channel model is presented and the proposed model is implemented in software using Matlab. The statistics of the simulated channels are analysed and compared with theory to confirm that the proposed model can accurately simulate Rayleigh and Rician fading characteristics. To assist system planners in the design and deployment of smart antennas, it is important to develop robust analytical tools to assess the impact of smart antennas on cellular systems. In this thesis an analytical model is presented for evaluating the Bit Error Rate (BER) of a DS-CDMA system employing an array antenna operating in Rayleigh and Rician fading environments. The DS-CDMA system is assumed to employ noncoherent M-ary orthogonal modulation, which is relevant to IS-95 CDMA and cdma2000. Using the analytical model, an expression of the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) at the output of the smart antenna receiver is derived, which allows the BER to be evaluated using a closed-form expression. The proposed model is shown to provide good agreement with the (computationally intensive) Monte Carlo simulation results and can be used to rapidly calculate the system performance for suburban and urban fading environments. In addition to MAI, the performance of CDMA systems is limited by fast fading. In this context, a hybrid scheme of beamforming and diversity called Hierarchical Beamforming (HBF) is investigated in this thesis to jointly combat MAI and fading. The main idea behind HBF is to divide the antenna elements into widely separated groups to form subbeamforming arrays. The performance of a hierarchical beamforming receiver, applied to an IS-95 CDMA system, is compared with smart antenna (conventional beamforming) receiver and the effect of varying the system and channel parameters is studied. The simulation results show that the performance of hierarchical beamforming is sensitive to the operating conditions, especially the value of the azimuth angle spread. The work presented in this thesis has been published in part in several journals and refereed conference papers, which reflects the originality and significance of the thesis contributions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">291701 Antenna Technology</field><field name="subject">280404 Numerical Analysis</field><field name="subject">671301 Broadcasting equipment</field><field name="subject">671399 Communication equipment not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Smart antennas</field><field name="subject">code division multiple access</field><field name="subject">mutual coupling</field><field name="subject">bit error rate</field><field name="subject">channel modelling</field><field name="subject">hierarchical beamforming</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157982</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Xylophagous Insects: developments in feeding assays</field><field name="creator">Peters, Brenton Charles</field><field name="description">Xylophagous borers and termites that damage "timber-in-service" cause millions of dollars loss annually throughout mainland Australia.

Feeding assays conducted in low termite risk areas are unduly prolonged, with inherently erratic termite feeding responses. I successfully developed feeding assays with a high termite risk. To establish whether a physical barrier, retrofitted as a sleeve, could prevent termites from damaging wooden poles, eighty poles were established within Beerburrum State Forest, south-east Queensland, Australia. Poles within sets were interconnected with buried timber to facilitate a high risk to Coptotermes acinaciformis (Froggatt). Mesh sleeves to a depth of 1.5m did not prevent termite damage to the poles. Hoop pine Araucaria cunninghamii Ait. ex D.Don dowels ("dip-sticks") were useful termite monitoring devices on the poles. The depth of foraging by termites has implications for the effectiveness of retrofitted physical and chemical barriers in general. Timber quantity and quality has a pivotal influence on the aggregation of large numbers of feeding termites necessary for baiting work and for producing efficacy data of relevance to the protection of timber-in-service from termites. Seasonal variation in termite foraging was examined. Both C. acinaciformis and Coptotermes lacteus (Froggatt) were more active feeding in summer than in autumn. In general, mass loss followed mean ambient temperature. Suppression of C. acinaciformis feeding responses relative to C. lacteus during summer, particularly during January, is thought to be due to excessive temperatures in the containers attached to infested trees. Termite foraging behaviour and responses to both varying masses of softwood timbers and varying exposure times were investigated. The rate of mass loss was independent of the number of test specimens and appeared linear. Colonies regulate the number of foragers directly according to the mass of susceptible timber available. This phenomenon was exploited throughout the remainder of the thesis. Of particular significance was the considerable intra- and inter-specific variation in susceptibility of softwoods to C. acinaciformis and Mastotermes darwiniensis Froggatt. The sapwoods tested were susceptible, but the heartwoods were generally resistant to damage by termites. These data confirm that termites are discriminating feeders, and some more so than others. A novel methodology, developed to maintain an environment conducive to sustained foraging by termites during field-testing, is presented. Consistency in timber acceptance and susceptibility to termites is considered to be important in determining the frequency of inspection and the success of bait systems. I evaluate the termiticidal activity of the bait toxicants hexaflumuron and chlorfluazuron for the management of the subterranean termite C. acinaciformis in the field. The Sentricon&#61650; Colony Elimination System with Baitube&#61650;-devices containing 0.1% and 1% mass/mass (m/m) hexaflumuron bait toxicant in dry wood flour (Recruit&#61650;) was successful in eliminating field colonies of C. acinaciformis. Similarly, the Exterra&#61668; Termite Interception and Baiting System with cellulose-acetate powder containing either 0.05% m/m or 0.25% m/m chlorfluazuron (Requiem&#61668;) eliminated C. acinaciformis. Indicators (including "dip-sticks") used to monitor colony health were reliable. By using C. acinaciformis, which builds mounds (epigeous nests) in northern Australia, I was able to avoid the use of multiple mark-release schemes to verify the effects of the bait toxicant on the termite colonies. Problems with multiple mark-release schemes, used elsewhere in the world, are discussed. I continued the focus on bait quality and placement by evaluating termite responses to two aspects of treated stakes, their attractiveness and their susceptibility. Three experiments were undertaken near Townsville and at Beerburrum, with Coptotermes and Schedorhinotermes. Whilst there were no significant differences in the rate of location and foraging, with respect to treatments, differences in foraging, with respect to C. acinaciformis and Schedorhinotermes seclusus (Hill) were significant. Coptotermes acinaciformis displayed greater foraging site tenacity than S. seclusus at Beerburrum. Increased consumption of bait, due to the addition of a phagostimulant, needs to be observed in the field before an increase in the efficacy of baits in a termite management program can be claimed. In Australia, softwood timbers are extensively used in building construction and are generally highly susceptible to damage by termites. I focussed on field feeding assays to test efficacy of borate-treated softwoods against termites and to define "adequate" protection thresholds. Laboratory and field data reported in the literature were confusing with regard to what constitutes "adequate" protection thresholds. The confusion was compounded by differences in termite species, timber species used and test methodology. Laboratory data indicated a borate loading of 0.5% m/m boric acid equivalent (BAE) would cause &gt; 90% termite mortality and restrict mass loss in test specimens to 5%. Field data generally suggested that borate loadings in excess of 0.5% m/m BAE were required. The main contribution of the work to increasing our understanding of management options for termites in the built environment was in resolving the confusion between laboratory and field data for borate wood-preservatives. These apparently conflicting results were explained by the presence or absence of untreated feeder material in the test environment. In the absence of untreated feeder material, retention of 0.5% BAE provides adequate protection from Coptotermes sp., whereas in the presence of untreated feeder material, increased retentions are required. Furthermore, the retentions required increase with increased amounts of susceptible material. Some termites, Nasutitermes sp. and M. darwiniensis, for example, are borate-tolerant and borate wood-preservatives are not a viable management option. The lack of uniform standards for termite-test methodology and assessment criteria for efficacy across the world is recognized as a difficulty with research into the performance of wood preservatives with termites. The many variables in laboratory and field assays make "prescriptive" standards difficult to recommend. The use of "performance" standards to define efficacy criteria ("adequate" protection) is discussed. Whilst the majority of the work involves subterranean termites ("termites"), I examine the question of how to define a hardwood timber species as "not susceptible" to lyctine beetle damage. Aspects of the biology, behaviour and management of Lyctus brunneus (Stephens) are reviewed and a novel field sampling and testing protocol to establish lyctine susceptibility of timber species is presented. A sound understanding of the biology and behaviour of xylophagous insects in the field is essential to ensure that management options implemented in the built environment have a strong ecological basis. The success of this study in achieving stated aims, the need for further work and the implications for test methodologies in the field with practical relevance to infestations of xylophagous insects in the built environment are discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300603 Pests, Health and Diseases</field><field name="subject">620304 Harvesting and transport of forest products</field><field name="subject">Xylophagous insects</field><field name="subject">borers</field><field name="subject">Lyctus</field><field name="subject">termites</field><field name="subject">Coptotermes</field><field name="subject">Mastotermes</field><field name="subject">Schedorhinotermes</field><field name="subject">field-based feeding assays</field><field name="subject">preventative action</field><field name="subject">remedial treatment</field><field name="subject">bait toxicant</field><field name="subject">attraction</field><field name="subject">susceptibility</field><field name="subject">borate wood-preservatives</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157981</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anterior-Posterior Ground Reaction Force Characteristics for Post-Block Foot Contacts in Sprint Running</field><field name="creator">Watts, Mark Charles</field><field name="description">Past research on the acceleration phase in sprint running has concentrated on the kinematics of sprint blocks set-up and the initial steps after exiting the sprint blocks. In contrast, there has been limited research on the ground reaction forces (GRF) generated during the initial post-block foot contacts. These initial foot contacts in sprinting are important for optimising performance in the initial acceleration phase of sprinting. However, little is known about the GRF elite sprinters generate during the initial foot contacts and how these GRF characteristics relate to performance. It is the anterior-posterior (A-P) GRF that are of most importance as they indicate the sprinter&#146;s motion from the start to the finish line. This thesis investigates the A-P GRF of the first two foot contacts of the sprint start after leaving the blocks. The participants included seventeen male and six female sprinters with a mean age of 22.6 (SD 4.4 years). Seventeen of the sprinters had competed at international/national level competitions and six at recreational/amateur level competitions. The athletes were classified as senior male elite (SME), senior female elite (SFE), junior male elite (JME) and senior male recreational (SMR). The sprinters were instructed to perform block starts at maximal effort to produce the fastest time over 5 metres on a 30 metre indoor laboratory track. Timing gates were used to record 5 metre times and two strain gauge force plates were placed in series to collect GRF data from the first two foot contacts after leaving the starting blocks. From the GRF data, braking time, maximum A-P braking force, A-P braking impulse, propulsive time, maximum A-P propulsive force, A-P propulsive impulse and A-P contact impulse were determined for each trial. The A-P propulsive phase constituted greater than 90% of the total contact time, had approximately twice the magnitude of the maximum force of the braking phase and accounted for more than 95% of the total contact impulse across the four groups of sprinters. The SME group produced a significantly larger A-P propulsive impulse on the first and second steps compared to the SFE (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.05 respectively), JME (not significant and p less than 0.05 respectively) and SMR (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.05 respectively) groups. The SME group&#146;s maximum A-P propulsive force was significantly larger on the first and second steps than the SFE (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.05 respectively), JME (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.05 respectively) and SMR (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.05 respectively) groups. The SME group&#146;s propulsive time on the first and second steps was not significantly different compared to the SFE (both not significant) but was significantly shorter compared to the JME (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.05 respectively) and SMR (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.05 respectively) groups. The maximum A-P propulsive force correlated strongly with 5 metre time for the first step (rs = -0.670, p less than 0.01), second step (rs = -0.621, p less than 0.01) and the addition of the first and second steps (rs = -0.678, p less than 0.01) across all the sprinters. Whereas, the A-P propulsive impulse correlated strongly with 5 metre time for the first step (rs = -0.525, p less than 0.01), second step (rs = -0.592, p less than 0.01) and the addition of the first and second steps (rs = -0.584, p less than 0.01). Three A-P GRF patterns were observed during the first and second foot contacts of the sprinters examined in this study. A braking-propulsive (B-P) pattern was the most frequently observed followed by a propulsive-braking-propulsive (P-B-P) and a no braking (NB) pattern 82.7%, 15.4% and 1.9% respectively. The P-B-P and NB patterns, which have not been described previously, appeared most frequently in the least experienced sprinters. In the past, some sprinters and their coaches have tried to minimise the braking phase and maximise the propulsive phase of the first two foot contacts after exiting the blocks during sprinting. This study suggests that increasing the maximum propulsive force is the best way to increase performance over the first 5 metres of the acceleration phase. The research also suggests that there will be little benefit gained from trying to increase performance by focusing on the braking phase during these first two steps after exiting the blocks. As such, sprinters and coaches should focus their attention primarily on producing a large A-P propulsive force during the first two steps of a sprint.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321405 Sports Medicine</field><field name="subject">750203 Organised sports</field><field name="subject">running</field><field name="subject">sprint</field><field name="subject">post-block</field><field name="subject">foot contacts</field><field name="subject">kinetics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157980</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Housing Opportunity and Residential Mobility in the Seoul Metropolitan Region, the Republic of Korea: Macro and Micro Approaches</field><field name="creator">Han, Jung Hoon</field><field name="description">This thesis examines residential relocation process within the Seoul Metropolitan Region (SMR) in the Republic of Korea at both a macro and micro level. The thesis makes theoretical and methodological contributions to residential mobility, housing vacancy chains and location choice behaviour in urban geography. The empirical study specifically focused on the relationship between housing opportunity and residential relocation process in the SMR during the 1990s. In developing countries, large scale suburban land and housing development on the fringe of metropolitan areas is seen as an important issue in the process of rapid urbanization and capital accumulation. This is particularly true of Korea where the population of the capital city, Seoul (SCC) has declined since the introduction of massive scale of new suburban housing developments in the 1990s. This is the first time the SCC&#146;s population has decreased in Korean modern history. However there is still debate about the impact of government proposed suburban new housing construction initiatives on residential relocation within the SMR. In addition there remain uncertainties concerning the impact of large suburban housing development on residential relocation behaviour. To date little evaluation of outcomes of the policies has been undertaken, a deficiency which this research seeks to address. Like other capital cities in the developing world, Seoul (SCC) has undergone significant urban expansion throughout its contemporary history, fuelled by the movement of refugees from North Korea in the period immediately following the end of the Korean War (1953) and by significant rural-to-urban, and later by intra urban movement. The SCC, in particular grew significantly, with the metropolitan area of Seoul soon expanding beyond its borders in a process akin to suburbanisation. The rapid urban growth in the Seoul Metropolitan Region (SMR) was accompanied by a series of urban problems including housing shortages, a decline in housing and urban quality, and the concentration of population in large cities, especially in the SCC. To counter these problems the national government in the Republic of Korea initiated a series of policies. Most prominently among these was a massive scale new housing development program initiated in 1988, aimed at developing large scale new satellite cites in Kyonggi, with the objective of decentralising the SCC&#146;s population and thus alleviating an urban housing shortage. This research focuses on two main issues charactering contemporary housing and land development policies in the SMR. The first relates to government efforts to redirect migration from the capital city, Seoul, to the outlying jurisdictions of Kyonggi and Inchon in an attempt to diffuse the concentration of population in the SCC and to alleviate housing shortages. The second issue concerns the determinants of residential mobility and residential location choice behaviour in the SMR. Mirroring the two issues, two approaches have been used to address these issues: a macro level study of residential relocation and a micro behavioural analysis. At macro level the research attempts to measure the impact of new housing developments on easing urban housing markets in the SMR during the 1990s, notwithstanding the continuous population movement from other regions in the Republic of Korea. The macro investigation addresses the questions: &#149; What are the changes in spatial mobility patterns occurring in the SMR since the introduction of government&#146;s suburban residential developments? &#149; Are the size of housing vacancy chains different by spatial mobility patterns among the three regional housing markets in the SMR? Multi-regional vacancy chain models are used to examine whether vacant housing opportunity spills over into neighbouring regions in the SMR, particularly the city of Seoul. The models focus mainly on the structural determinants of household mobility, such as local new housing construction, household formation, household mobility rate and demolition rate, and their role in creating and absorbing vacant housing opportunities in the three jurisdictions comprising the SMR: Seoul (SCC), Kyonggi and Inchon. The vacancy chain analysis uses a Markov chain model and Leontief input-output model to assess the impact of these structural differentials on household mobility in the multiregional system of the SMR. This macro study provides a structural framework for the subsequent micro behavioural approach to residential mobility occurring in the SMR. The micro behavioural approach investigates the following questions: &#149; What are the socio demographic profiles of people who relocate within the SMR?&#146; &#149; What are the housing transitions that occur after moving to regions of the SCC in the SMR? &#149; What are the reasons households give for moving within the SMR? This micro approach focuses on the behavioural aspects of residential mobility decision process as influenced by age, marital status, employment status, education level, duration of residence, dwelling size and tenure status. Apart from the mover&#146;s socio demographic profile, the study further investigates longitudinal housing transitions before and after a move by their origin and destination within the SMR, particularly those movers who relocated to suburban rings (Kyonggi/Inchon). However the reasons for movers to choose a particular location vary and they are socio demographically diverse. The research also discusses these behavioural reasons for moving within the SMR.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">370502 Migration</field><field name="subject">759900 Other Social Development and Community Services</field><field name="subject">residential mobility</field><field name="subject">migration</field><field name="subject">housing</field><field name="subject">housing choice</field><field name="subject">housing market</field><field name="subject">vacancy chains</field><field name="subject">korea</field><field name="subject">seoul</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157977</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Limitations to plant root growth in highly saline and alkaline bauxite residue</field><field name="creator">Kopittke, Peter Martin</field><field name="description">Revegetation of bauxite residue is hampered by a lack of understanding of the limitations imposed on plant growth in highly saline and alkaline growth mediums. In this study, several of these growth limiting factors were investigated. The toxicity of the hydroxyl ion (OH-) was examined using a solution culture system developed to allow studies at high pH without nutritional limitations. Also using this solution culture system, the effect of the high Na and Mg concentrations of bauxite residue on the Ca nutrition of plants was investigated. As the toxicity of Al at high pH is not known, a study was conducted to examine the rhizotoxicity of aluminate (Al(OH)4-) and polycationic Al at high pH. The ability of plant roots to reduce rhizosphere pH in bauxite residue was also considered. A novel gypsum application method was assessed for its efficiency at improving the Ca status of bauxite residue. Manual adjustment, ion exchange resins and automated titration were examined for their suitability for nutrient solution pH control in alkaline conditions. For short-term studies, it was found that a solution without supply of Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn, and aerated with CO2 depleted air, greatly reduced nutrient precipitation at high pH, thus eliminating nutritional differences between treatments. Manual pH adjustment and the use of ion exchange resins as pH buffers were unsuitable methods of pH control. In contrast, pH control by automated titration had little effect on solution composition while maintaining constant pH. The solution culture system was used to examine OH- toxicity in mungbeans (Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek cv. Emerald), with root length reduced at a bulk solution pH of 8.5 and greater. The effect of Ca activity ratio (CAR) and pH on Ca uptake by mungbeans and Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana cv. Pioneer) in Na dominated solution cultures and in soil was investigated. Changes in pH in the alkaline range were shown to have no effect on the critical CAR of 0.024 (corresponding to 90 % relative root length) for mungbeans grown in solution culture. Results from soil grown mungbeans confirmed those from solution culture, with a critical CAR of 0.025. A critical CAR of 0.034 was also established for soil grown Rhodes grass. However, using dilute nutrient solutions dominated by Mg at pH 9.0, root growth was found to be more limited than had been observed for Na solutions, with growth reduced beneath a critical CAR of 0.050. Using a CAR equation modified with plasma membrane binding constants (to incorporate the differing antagonistic effects of Mg and Na), new critical CAR values were calculated for Na (0.56) and Mg (0.44) dominated solutions. This modified CAR equation permits the calculation of CAR irrespective of the dominant salt present. Solubilities of various gypsum sources and size fractions in seawater were studied to investigate the effectiveness of gypsum addition to the residue sand pipeline, rather than as a direct field application. The dissolution rate constant varied with gypsum source (analytical grade (AR) &gt; phosphogypsum (PG) &gt; mined gypsum (MG)) due to reactivity and surface area differences, generally reaching saturation within 15 s (AR) to 30 min (MG &gt; 2.0). The ability of bauxite residue to remove Ca from solution (due to cation exchange and precipitation) was also examined; the quantity of the total solution Ca adsorbed was found to be small (5 %). These low rates of solution Ca adsorption, comparatively rapid dissolution rates, and long pumping times (20 min), preclude the application of gypsum to the residue sand/seawater slurry as a method for residue amelioration. Dilute, alkaline (pH 9.5) nutrient solutions were used to investigate the effects of aluminate (Al(OH)4-) on mungbean root growth. Although root growth in Al(OH)4- solutions was slightly limited, the symptoms associated with this growth reduction were observed to be similar to those caused by the Al13 polycation at concentrations lower than that which can be detected. Also, when roots displaying these symptoms were transferred to fresh Al(OH)4- solutions, no root tip lesions were observed, and root hair growth on the lateral roots improved. Thus, Al(OH)4- is considered to be non-toxic, with the observed reduction in root growth in solutions containing Al(OH)4- due to the gradual formation of toxic Al13 in the bulk nutrient solution resulting from the acidification of the alkaline nutrient solution by the plant roots. The effect of Mn deficiency in Rhodes grass and of legume inoculation in lucerne (Medicago sativa L. cv. Hunter River), on the rhizosphere pH of plants grown in highly alkaline bauxite residue was investigated. In response to Mn deficiency in residue sand, Rhodes grass was observed to increase acidification of its rhizosphere (being up to 1.22 pH units lower than the bulk soil). Due to its ability to fix atmospheric N2 rather than relying on soil N (NO3-) reserves, inoculated lucerne (1.75 pH unit decrease) was also found to acidify its rhizosphere to a greater extent than non-inoculated lucerne (1.16 pH unit decrease).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300804 Environmental Impact Assessment</field><field name="subject">770806 Remnant vegetation and protected conservation areas</field><field name="subject">Aluminate toxicity</field><field name="subject">alkalinity</field><field name="subject">salinity</field><field name="subject">rhizosphere pH</field><field name="subject">gypsum dissolution</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Late Silurian to Middle Devonian acanthodians of eastern Australia</field><field name="creator">Burrow, Carole J</field><field name="description">The acanthodians were a common and widespread group of fishes throughout the world during the mid-Palaeozoic. In this study, a full-scale systematic analysis of Silurian to Middle Devonian acanthodian taxa of eastern Australia was undertaken, incorporating a review and updating of historical records and descriptions of taxa. Phylogenetic relationships within the group and with other early gnathostomes are uncertain. The structure, function and modes of growth of acanthodian scales were described and investigated, and these features were used for comparisons between different taxa within the group, and between acanthodians and other early vertebrates. Histological and morphological characters of the scales were incorporated in a cladistic analysis of genera erected for articulated fish. This analysis did not support the traditional ordinal level groups, the Climatiida, Ischnacanthida and Acanthodida. Therefore, the highest taxonomic level used in the study was the family. Rarely were acanthodians preserved as articulated fossils. The only examples known from the Silurian-Middle Devonian of Australia are one specimen of the putative acanthodian Yealepis douglasi Burrow &amp; Young 1999 from the Ludlow of Victoria, five specimens of an indeterminate ?ischnacanthidid from the late Givetian of New South Wales and a rich assemblage from the Givetian lacustrine shales of Mt Howitt, Victoria. The latter fauna (originally dated as Late Devonian) includes six incomplete specimens of the culmacanthidid Culmacanthus stewarti Long 1983 and about 60 specimens of acanthodidid Howittacanthus kentoni Long 1986. In contrast, disassociated remains of the group are ubiquitous in microvertebrate faunas from the mid-Palaeozoic of eastern Australia. Although scales of other fish groups are sometimes more common in particular facies, acanthodian elements are found in all depositional environments, from deep shelf marine to transitional to freshwater. Most of the taxa, particularly those only preserved as isolated scales, had not been systematically described by other workers. This thesis incorporates descriptions of new taxa, and revision and updating of other taxa. Several overseas studies have produced biostratigraphic charts based on acanthodian scales. A similar biostratigraphic overview was undertaken based on a systematic analysis of the Early Devonian acanthodians of eastern Australia, permitting comparisons with acanthodian faunas of other regions. Acanthodian scales and fin spines are the most common elements in the few vertebrate faunas that are known from the Silurian of Australia. Diversity and geographic distribution of the acanthodian faunas peaked during the Early Devonian. This study has been hampered by the low numbers of scales in many samples, and by uncertainty over their dating (particularly for the faunas from non-limestone deposits). Nevertheless, the work shows that changes in the marine assemblages are broadly correlated with the pattern of marine transgressions and regressions. Composition of the acanthodian faunas, and their abundance relative to other vertebrates in the assemblages, depend on the depositional environment. This correlation is best illustrated in Lower Devonian deposits, in which acanthodians are the most prolific and diverse. In transitional and marginal marine deposits, thelodonts are dominant, and acanthodians a minor element of the fauna. In off-shore assemblages, acanthodians and placoderms are dominant, and thelodonts are rare or absent. Vertebrate faunas are poor in the earliest Devonian deposits, but become more common by the late Lochkovian, with near-shore assemblages characterized by Trundlelepis cervicostulata and ANostolepis@ guangxiensis, and deeper shelf assemblages by a new genus, possibly assignable to the Ischnacanthidae. The vertebrate record is sparse through the middle Pragian, though AN.@ guangxiensis is present low in the Coopers Creek Limestone (upper sulcatus-pireneae zones), being replaced by Nostolepoides platymarginata, Gomphonchus? bogongensis, and Radioporacanthodes sp. aff. R. (Gomphonchus) liujingensis by the kindlei Zone. Microvertebrate assemblages are more common by the late Pragian (pireneae Zone), with Radioporacanthodes sp. aff. R. liujingensis in deeper shelf deposits, and N. platymarginata and G.? bogongensis dominating near-shore assemblages. The earliest Emsian (dehiscens Zone) is marked by the incoming Cheiracanthoides wangi. Middle Emsian (perbonus-serotinus zones) assemblages are characterized by two new species, possibly assignable to Gomphonchus.The Middle Devonian cosmopolitan association of Cheiracanthoides comptus and AAcanthoides@ dublinensis, which characterizes early Middle Devonian faunas from North America, Europe and China, appears first in the latest Emsian at the serotinus-patulus zone boundary. As well as showing the value of acanthodians in biostratigraphy and as indicators of environmental settings, their use in biogeography was demonstrated. Although many of the acanthodian taxa are endemic, several are also found in other regions. The Silurian to earliest Devonian faunas of eastern Australia are most closely related to coeval Chinese assemblages. Several latest Silurian-earliest Devonian taxa are also recorded from the circum-Arctic region. The late Lochkovian to early Emsian assemblages, particularly from south-eastern Australia, have many taxa in common with Chinese faunas. The mid-Emsian taxa show highest endemicity; and the latest Emsian-Eifelian assemblages have the most cosmopolitan aspect. Acanthodian faunas become rarer and depauperate in the Middle Devonian, particularly in the south-eastern corner, and are mostly in poorly dated, ?fluviatile/marginal marine deposits. This study of acanthodian faunas has encompassed a full scale systematic review of the group in this region, an appraisal of phylogenetic relationships within the group and with other early vertebrates, their palaeoecology, and their use in biostratigraphy and biogeography.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260112 Palaeontology</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="subject">Acanthodii</field><field name="subject">Devonian</field><field name="subject">Silurian</field><field name="subject">bistratigraphy</field><field name="subject">biogeography</field><field name="subject">eastern Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157975</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The social context of familial child sexual abuse: the mother's perspective</field><field name="creator">Porter, Janet</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the experiences of mothers whose children have been sexually abused by a male adult family member. It explores the relationships between the effect of biographical and social factors on mothers' perceptions and their experiences on learning of their children's sexual abuse. It also includes interrelated aims: a)to identify implications from the research for the development and extension of qualitative research methodology, and b)to develop and extend the understanding of the mothers' role in the sexually abusive situation. The mothers' perspectives and how they experienced the phenomenon of the sexual abuse of their child are central to the study. Historically the mother has been marginal to empirically based research while central to explanations regarding the causes and responsibility for the sexually abusive situation. Increasingly as the extent of sexual abuse as a social problem has been realised, the mother's role has been seen as central in the support of her children after the disclosure. In the literature, however, the lack of empirical research relating to the mother's experiences results in adherence to general prescriptive knowledges about motherhood. The primacy of the mothers' narratives in this study is therefore emphasised. Thirty mothers participated in the study and were a self selecting sample. They were contacted through social workers, self referral through other participants, and a private agency. The study combined quantitative and qualitative approaches. Quantitative approaches allowed the collection of socio-economic, demographic data and characteristics of the sexually abusive situation. This data was used to compare findings within and between cases and between this study and others reported in the literature. The interview guide was used as a prompt sheet rather than a structure of the interview process. The interview data contained the mothers' perceptions of their life experiences and how these affected their responses and reactions to events and relationships before and after disclosure of the abuse. This study, however, differed from much of the previous research in using qualitative approaches and in encouraging mothers to discuss what was of importance to them. The focus throughout the study was on the mothers' subjective realities and how they changed over time, as they attempted to make sense of their role in the establishment and maintenance of the abusive situation. The mothers were able to report their experiences in their own way, and were able to make their own links between ideas and perceptions which were not structured by the research process. The thirty transcripts were sorted and analysed using NUD*IST, a computer software programme for manageing non numerical, unstructured data. From the mothers' narratives four regularities and processes were noted: childhood socialisation in the family of origin, courtship and marriage, relationship to the abuser, and the disclosure of the abuse. Within each of these regularities and processes, similarities and differences were identified in relation to a number of themes and sub themes as the mothers reconstructed their experiences. The study focuses on how they experienced: the disclosure process; their relationship to the abuser, the child and perception of the abuser/child relationship; and who caused and was responsible for the perpetration of the abuse. The mothers' life experiences within different family and social contexts impacted on them in various ways. All the mothers contended, however, that for the abuser to sexually abuse the child in secret required not only the manipulation of the child but also the manipulation of others in the family and social environment. The primacy given to the mothers' experiences gives an alternative perspective to the understanding of the environments and processes involved in the maintenance and establishment of the sexually abusive situation and the mothers' role. Their accounts are local, contextualised and grounded in their life experiences. Their experiences are used as a basis for a critical analysis of family systems theory. A tentative theoretical development has also been presented using concepts from chaos theory and Foucault in a heuristic way. This study has implications for workers in the areas of investigation and therapeutic intervention. The mothers' perspectives challenge views presented in the literature about the culpability or powerlessness of the mother. Their experiences of the sexually abusive environment and processes involved, give insight into the manipulative and controlling strategies of the abusers.

Chemical extraction techniques that measure P and N in runoff and sediments have provided little information on biologically available P and N, particularly when soils/sediments move from an agricultural setting to freshwater, estuarine and marine systems. The aims of this thesis were to a) develop algal bioassay techniques for assessing bioavailability of P in marine and freshwater sediments, b) apply algal bioassays to determine the role of suspended sediments as P and N sources c) examine how sediment type and sediment load affect P bioavailability and identify the chemical analysis of soil P that best reflects bioavailable P, and d) determine nutrient bioavailability of agricultural soil runoff in estuarine and coastal marine ecosystems. An accurate and repeatable sediment bioassay was developed using non-axenic uni-algal cultures of the euryhaline diatom Skeletonema costatum and freshwater chlorophyte Selenastrum capricornutum. Bioassays were conducted in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks, with 100 mg L-1 of simulated sediment and 100 mL of modified growth media, which were continuously shaken. Suspended sediments were simulated from 7 major soil types of the Maroochy River catchment in Australia, a coastal catchment influenced by agriculture. Simulated sediments were used as the sole P source in replicate batch 7-14 d bioassays in which changes in in vivo Chl a fluorescence were measured. Maximum algal biomass in bioassays was significantly correlated to total sediment P content of the added sediment in marine and freshwater. Bioassay methodology was adapted to assess N as well as P bioavailability in simulated suspended sediments using Skeletonema costatum. S. costatum biomass was significantly influenced by sediment type and correlated with the Total P content of the sediment. Conversely, S. costatum response did not correlate to total nitrogen (TN), ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3-) and easily mineralisable N content of the sediment. Sediment type did significantly influence response, suggesting that sorption/desorption properties of the sediment influenced N bioavailability. Suspended sediments appear to be a significant source of bioavailable P as S. costatum biomass was enhanced by their addition. Conversely, the lack of stimulation by sediments when used as a N source implies that suspended sediments are not an immediate source of bioavailable N, although they do contribute to the sediment nutrient pool once deposited. The influence of sediment type and sediment load on phosphorus (P) bioavailability was compared using Skeletonema costatum bioassays. The amount of sediment and associated P load influenced the maximum algal biomass reached, with low sediment loads (&amp;lt 100 mg L-1) capable of stimulating high algal biomass. Maximum algal biomass correlated with sediment iron-oxide extractable inorganic P (FeO-P) and inorganic P (Pi) extracted by sodium bicarbonate for all sediment types. Total P (TP) did not discriminate at low TP concentrations and organic P (Po) extracted by sodium bicarbonate only correlated with algal biomass when bioavailable P was low. Thus FeO-P and Pi are the most representative analyses of bioavailable P. FeO-P can also be used to accurately measure rate of sediment P desorption, which significantly influences algal growth rate. Nutrient bioavailability of agricultural soil runoff was investigated in the Maroochy River catchment in southeast Queensland Australia, a coastal catchment influenced by agriculture. Suspended sediments, river and estuarine sediments and deposited sediment in the near-shore coastal zone were collected and analysed for nutrient bioavailability using chemical analyses and S. costatum bioassays. Suspended sediments in the Maroochy River, which consisted of silt and clay sized particles, had elevated FeO-P and TP concentrations comparable to fertilised soil. Similarly the deposited sediment sampled offshore to the river mouth had elevated total P, FeO-P and total N concentrations which were much greater than the underlying marine sediment. The deposited offshore sediment contained mainly silt sized particles and appeared to be terrigenous in origin as it was more similar in composition (TP, FeO-P, TN, total carbon, total aluminium, total iron, total silica) to estuarine suspended sediments and terrestrial soils, than the underlying marine sediment. This study demonstrated that fine silt sized particles, rich in bioavailable P and N, are being transported and deposited offshore during erosion events. These findings highlight the importance of effective land management and erosion control measures that reduce the suspended sediment load. Although agricultural practices are continually improving to reduce soil erosion, practices need to encompass a broader approach that emphasizes the link between land and sea. Effective management must consider agricultural productivity as well as the environmental impact or &#145;algal bloom potential&#146; that a soil may have when eroded into a waterway. Soils high in bioavailable nutrients must be targeted and managed effectively, particularly in areas prone to erosion.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sediments</field><field name="subject">bioavailable nutrients</field><field name="subject">phytoplankton bioassays</field><field name="subject">runoff</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157973</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australian Bat Lyssavirus</field><field name="creator">Barrett, Janine Louise</field><field name="description">In Chapter 1, the literature relating to rabies virus and the rabies like lyssaviruses is reviewed. In Chapter 2 data are presented from 1170 diagnostic submissions for ABLV testing by fluorescent antibody test (Centocor FAT). All 27 non-bat submissions were ABLV-negative. Of 1143 bat accessions 74 (16%) were ABLV-positive, including 69 of 974 (7.1%) flying foxes (Pteropus spp.), 5 of 7 (71.4%) Saccolaimus flaviventris (Yellow-bellied sheathtail bats), none of 151 other microchiropteran bats, and none of 11 unidentified bats. Statistical analysis of data from 868 wild Black, Grey-headed, Little Red and Spectacled flying foxes (Pteropus alecto, P. poliocephalus, P. scapulatus, and P. conspicillatus) indicated that three factors; species, health status and age were associated with significant (p&amp;lt 0.001) differences in the proportion of ABLV-positive bats. Other factors including sex, whether the bat bit a person or animal, region, year, and season submitted, were not associated with ABLV. Case data for 74 ABLV-positive bats, including the circumstances in which they were found and clinical signs, is presented. In Chapter 3, the aetiological diagnosis was investigated for 100 consecutive flying fox submissions with neurological signs. ABLV (32%), spinal and head injuries (29%), and neuro-angiostrongylosis (18%) accounted for most neurological syndromes in flying foxes. No evidence of lead poisoning was found in unwell (n=16) or healthy flying foxes (n=50). No diagnosis was reached for 16 cases, all of which were negative for ABLV by TaqMan&#174; PCR. The molecular diversity of ABLV was examined in Chapter 4 by sequencing 36 bases of the leader sequence, the entire N gene, and start of the P gene of 28 isolates from pteropid bats and 3 isolates from Yellow-bellied sheathtail (YBST) bats. Phylogenetic analysis indicated all ABLV isolates clustered together as a discrete group within the Lyssavirus genera closely related to rabies virus and European bat lyssavirus-2 isolates. The ABLV lineage consisted of two variants; one (ybst-ABLV) consisted of isolates only from YBST bats, the other (pteropid-ABLV) was common to Black, Grey-headed and Little Red flying foxes. No associations were found between the sequences and either the geographical location or year found, or individual flying fox species. In Chapter 5, 15 inocula prepared from the brains or salivary glands of naturally-infected bats were evaluated by intracerebral (IC) and footpad (FP) inoculation of Quackenbush mice in order to select and characterize a highly virulent inoculum for further use in bats (Inoculum 5). In Chapter 6, nine Grey-headed flying foxes were inoculated with 105.2 to 105.5 MICED50 of Inoculum 5 divided into four sites, left footpad, pectoral muscle, temporal muscle and muzzle. Another bat was inoculated with half this dose divided into the footpad and pectoral muscle only. Seven of 10 bats developed clinical disease of 1 to 4 days duration between PI-days 10 and 19 and were shown to be ABL-positive by FAT, HAM immunoperoxidase staining, virus isolation in v mice, and TaqMan PCR. Five of the seven bats displayed overt aggression, one died during a seizure, and one showed intractable agitation, pacing, tremors, and ataxia. Viral antigen was demonstrated throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems and in the epithelial cells of the submandibular salivary glands (n=4). All affected bats had mild to moderate non-suppurative meningoencephalitis and severe ganglioneuritis. No ABLV was detected in three bats that remained well until the end of the experiment on day 82. One survivor developed a strong but transient antibody response. In Chapter 7, the relative virulence of inocula prepared from the brains and salivary glands of experimentally infected flying foxes was evaluated in mice by IC and FP inoculation and TaqMan assay. The effects in mice were correlated to the TaqMan CT value and indicated a crude association between virulence and CT value that has potential application in the selection of inocula. In Chapter 8, 36 Black and Grey-headed flying foxes were vaccinated with one (day 0) or two (+ day 28) doses of Nobivac rabies vaccine and co-vaccinated with keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH). All bats responded to the Nobivac vaccine with a rabies-RFFIT titer &amp;gt 0.5 IU/mL that is nominally indicative of protective immunity. Plasma from bats with rabies titres &amp;gt 2 IU/mL had cross-neutralising ABLV titres &amp;gt 1:154. A specifically developed ELISA detected a strong but transient response to KLH.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bat</field><field name="subject">flying fox</field><field name="subject">pteropus</field><field name="subject">rabies</field><field name="subject">lyssavirus</field><field name="subject">vaccination</field><field name="subject">risk factors</field><field name="subject">Australian bat lyssavirus</field><field name="subject">nervous system disease</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157971</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lamentation Settings by Manuel Jos&#233; Doyag&#252;e (1755&#150;1842) Recently Rediscovered in Manila: A Contextual Study and Critical Transcription</field><field name="creator">Irving, David Ronald Marshall</field><field name="description">This thesis consists of a contextual study and critical transcription of five Lamentation settings by the Spanish composer Manuel Jos&#233; Doyag&#252;e (1755&#150;1842), the sources for which were recently found in a unique bound collection of music manuscripts from the University of Santo Tom&#225;s, Manila, the Philippines. With the disappearance of most musical sources dating from the Spanish Colonial Period in the Philippines (1565-1898), due to the complete destruction of the walled city centre Intramuros in 1945, the rediscovery of this bound collection entitled &#147;Partituras&#148; is significant, as it indicates the type of repertoire that was possibly known and performed in nineteenth-century Intramuros. The largest group of works by any one composer is five Lamentation settings by Doyag&#252;e, which take up almost a third of the volume. The scores for these works restore incomplete copies held in Spain, and attribute to Doyag&#252;e two settings which were previously unknown. The introduction includes a discussion of the historical and cultural context and the circumstances of the re-discovery in the Philippines. Part I examines the history of the musical activity of the Dominican Order in the Philippines, and considers the possible means of transmission of the manuscripts from Spain to Manila. Part II examines the Lamentations genre and includes a biographical study of the composer Manuel Jos&#233; Doyag&#252;e. Part III is made up of a source study of the manuscripts and a critical edition of the five works, while areas for future research are indicated in the conclusion.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Music</field><field name="subject">Manila</field><field name="subject">Philippines</field><field name="subject">Lamentations</field><field name="subject">Doyag&#252;e</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157972</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Water Movement in Unsaturated Concrete: Theory, Experiments, Models</field><field name="creator">Leech, Craig Anthony</field><field name="description">Prediction of contaminant transport in concrete subjected to short cyclical wetting and drying processes is integrally bound to prediction of the moisture flux. The concrete is unsaturated and the non-linear contaminant and moisture fluxes are not described by simple constant diffusion methods. This thesis presents, and partially justifies, a thermodynamic model for prediction of moisture movement in concrete, at all moisture contents commonly encountered. The wetting process is examined with Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) images during a simple absorption (sorptivity) experiment. Diffusivity functions are derived via a novel analytical approach and a universal diffusivity is suggested. Water sorption and desorption isotherms are measured on large concrete samples. van Genuchten&#146;s retention function is successfully used to model the results. The unrelia-bility of the water sorption method at high moisture contents is illustrated by comparison with Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry (MIP). The BJH method is exploited to provide a methodology for estimating the water sorption isotherm from MIP. Mualem&#146;s conductivity model is assessed with the water retention and NMR results. This thorough validation of the model yields a tortuosity parameter that is different to that commonly assumed. An analytical relationship between the sorptivity and the saturated permeability suggests the experimental the long-term unsaturated permeability overesti-mates the unsaturated conductivity function, and as such should be used judiciously when predicting unsaturated flow processes. Mualem&#146;s conductivity model is further exploited to provide unsaturated air and vapour functions that are experimentally justified. The thermodynamic description of water movement and the hydraulic functions that are developed in the thesis are incorporated into T r inCet , a transient heat and mass trans-fer model based on the Finite Element Method (FEM). The complex coupled behaviour of air, liquid, vapour and temperature are well handled under a variety of common cyclical boundary conditions. The thesis presents all necessary experimental results required for validation of a com-plex, but easily described, model for moisture movement. It covers disparate ground to provide a powerful numerical model of unsaturated moisture movement in concrete under short-term cyclical processes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="subject">680299 Other</field><field name="subject">sorptivity</field><field name="subject">NMR</field><field name="subject">concrete</field><field name="subject">water retention</field><field name="subject">moisture</field><field name="subject">MIP</field><field name="subject">unsaturated</field><field name="subject">permeability</field><field name="subject">numerical</field><field name="subject">FEM</field><field name="subject">water</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157970</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nonverbal narratives: Practitioner perspectives on narratives for people with severe intellectual disability.</field><field name="creator">Dennis, Rea</field><field name="description">To date people with severe and profound intellectual disability have been excluded from participatory research projects. This is often due to complex ethical issues and to concerns about how they would make themselves heard or understood. Razack (1993) suggests that the moral obligation to hear such contributions lies with the listener. This study constitutes an investigation of how such listening occurs with contributors who are labeled as having a severe or profound intellectual disability. Human service practitioners who work closely with, and who constantly find themselves listening to and interpreting for, people with severe and profound intellectual disability were recruited for the study. Five focus groups were conducted with these workers. The study revealed that personal values often underpin the various strategies practitioners employed when listening to people with severe disability. Elements like believing the person has something to say; having the time and perseverance to listen; sharing some common interests/rapport with the person and; being able to minimise the many barriers &#151; physical environment, people, self-attitude &#151; that are instrumental in blocking a listener&#146;s capacity.

Ponds offer a robust and operationally simple technology, which are inexpensive where land is available, and have the potential to provide a considerable degree of treatment. However the continued use of WSP is being undermined by their inconsistent performance relative to current discharge requirements, particularly with respect to suspended solids, pathogen and nutrient removal. In a climate of increased public awareness of pollution, and the ever more stringent environmental protection regulations, novel pond designs need to be developed, and existing ponds retro-fitted, to improve their performance. This dissertation investigated the hydraulic modelling of non-mechanically mixed ponds, and produced a modelling framework from which improved pond designs could be evaluated. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were used to develop models which were able to predict the hydraulics of arbitrarily shaped, non-mechanically mixed ponds under controlled conditions. The models represent an important departure from traditional pond modelling techniques, which are based on either historical experience or simple hydraulic and reaction models. The CFD approach overcomes the main limitation of these models, as it accounts for spatial variations of parameters within a pond such as fluid velocity, or pollutant concentration. This allows for the prediction of pond hydraulics based on the pond geometry (such as inlet configuration, pond shape or baffle placement), pond inlet boundary conditions and the fluid properties. Thus CFD models allow the rapid investigation of the effect of design modifications on pond performance. The WSP models were designed using a two stage process. The first stage, a steady state simulation, calculated the velocity and turbulence fields for the pond; the second stage, a transient numerical tracer, utilised the underlying steady state results to calculate the advection and diffusion of a tracer species. The species concentration at the outlet was then integrated to produce residence time distributions (RTD) and other quantities which were used to characterise the pond hydraulics, and quantitatively compare the models with experimental results to assess the pond&#161;&#166;s performance. These techniques could be applied to any numerical pond flow model, and are a discerning test of the model&#161;&#166;s consistency. RTD generated from two-dimensional (2-D) CFD simulations were compared to experimental RTD derived by Mangelson and Watters (1972). In one of the three geometries simulated, the 2-D CFD model successfully predicted the experimental RTD. However, the flow patterns in the other two geometries were not well described, due to the difficulty of representing a three dimensional (3-D) inlet in the 2-D CFD model. As no general relationship could be found for approximating a 2-D inlet in 3-D, full 3-D simulations were used to model the unsuccessful cases. The 3 D simulations provided much improved results, predicting all the major features of the RTD over the first residence time, and matching exponential decay of the RTD after this period. Due to the uncertainty in the exact experimental inlet dimensions, a range of inlet depths were simulated. This showed that the CFD model was sensitive to changes in the inlet configuration, and using the appropriate inlet depth, the simulated RTD matched the experimental results well. A sensitivity analysis of the effect of the inlet turbulent boundary conditions and tracer molecular diffusivity for the k-&#131;&#213; turbulent model, showed the RTD was insensitive to these properties, thereby confirming similar results in related systems (Benelmouffok, 1989; De Vantier and Larock, 1987). This is significant for future pond modelling, as these properties are difficult to measure experimentally or predict reliably. Tracer studies were performed in this dissertation on five full-scale pond systems. In Tasmania three identical sewage ponds with different inlet and baffle configurations were investigated. However wind conditions in this locality masked any effect of these modifications. Tracer studies were also performed on sugar mill ponds near Mackay. While the models predicted qualitative consistent RTD results, they did not match the experimentally measured RTD due to uncontrolled environmental mixing factors and the long residence times of these ponds. A preliminary investigation of the effect of wind mixing was undertaken by imposing a velocity to the top surface of the model. These results confirmed the strong influence of even small wind velocities due to the large surface area of the ponds. Practical experience has indicated that the pond hydraulics are often the limiting factor in pond performance. Both experimental and simulation results have confirmed this through the presence of short circuiting and dead zones within the pond. Three baffle designs were assessed, all of which improved the pond hydraulics by either dispersing the inlet jet, or utilising the jet to generate specific pond mixing. Finally the work in this thesis has highlighted a number of other areas for future investigation. These include reservations over the use of RTD to characterise full-scale pond hydraulics, and considerations regarding the most efficient use of the inlet mixing in ponds. The hydraulic models developed in this dissertation can be extended to include solids, stratification and reaction models, which would enable the direct validation of the model based on physical or chemical parameters. In addition, a coupled flow and reaction model would provide a tool that could be used to truly optimise pond performance. This offers the possibility of tailoring the design of ponds for specific reactions, such as improved biological nutrient removal.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">waste stabilisation ponds</field><field name="subject">WSP</field><field name="subject">wastewater treatment</field><field name="subject">computational fluid dynamics</field><field name="subject">CFD</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="subject">fluid dynamics</field><field name="subject">mixing</field><field name="subject">residence time distribution</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157968</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Complexity approach to national IT policy making: The case of Malaysia's Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC)</field><field name="creator">Abdul Wahab, Amirudin</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT This dissertation examines the design and implementation of Malaysia's national Information Technology (IT) policy with a focus on the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) project. Qualitative research methods, including in-depth interviews, document analysis and literature analysis, were used to build an understanding of the development of the MSC. The analysis adopts a holistic approach that draws upon the multidisciplinary perspectives of complex adaptive systems in order to understand how social, economic, political and institutional forces interact in a changing environment. This research contributes a policy framework called Goal-Policy-Implementation-Outcome (GPIO), which is used to understand, describe and assess the MSC policy design and methods. It is one of the first public studies of the MSC and one of very few complex systems analyses of a socio-economic system in a developing country. It has been argued that many countries around the world are competing rapidly to produce 'visionary' reports and policy statements on the future of their nations and societies in the 'Information Age'. This is due to the belief that IT can play critical role in stimulating the socio-economic growth of the countries. In Malaysia, the government embarked on an ambitious program to establish the MSC as an attempt to achieve Vision 2020, a national vision and Malaysia's statement of national goals that articulates the country's objective for developed-nation status, while moving towards the creation of an information-rich society by the year 2020. Despite the importance of national IT policies and the major commitment of resources to implement them, there are few critical studies of the positive and negative impacts of 'post-industrial' or 'information society' policy, particularly in the developing countries like Malaysia. This study seeks in part to fill this gap by providing a critical assessment of a Malaysian national IT policy. This research argues that IT policy for national development must be viewed holistically, taking into consideration innovations needed in the social, economic, political and institutional spheres, rather than taking limited view of IT as an economic growth engine. This is a paradigm shift that represents a movement from the traditional worldview (TWV), that was based on the Cartesian/Newtonian paradigm into new ways of thinking and action that is labelled here as the emerging worldview (EMV). The EMV is grounded in complexity theory, an interdisciplinary endeavour that draws upon ideas from a number of fields and seeks to understand and model systems with many interacting parts. This approach can help policy makers and analysts to understand, assess and develop a more balanced and comprehensive policy for the evolution of new technology such as IT and to tackle the complexity of socio-economic change of a dynamic real world setting. The data collection method is from in-depth, open-ended interviews and document analysis. This qualitative exploratory approach was chosen to understand and capture the points of view of other people without specifically limiting the lines of inquiry through questionnaires etc. This research was influenced by multiple theoretical frameworks, because taking one framework alone in analysing the complex issues involved in ICT would not provide a comprehensive understanding of the interplay of the socio-technical and techno-economic paradigms. This resulted in the contribution of a policy framework called Goal-Policy-Implementation-Outcome (GPIO), which is used to understand, describe and assess the MSC policy design and method. This research found that the MSC policy plan and process were not working as intended to achieve the goals of Vision 2020. The strategy of clustering businesses in one physical location to establish synergy did not work as anticipated because: (1) Cyberjaya was not yet fully ready with all the necessary people, infrastructure and community since many basic amenities have yet to be competed; (2) The distance of Cyberjaya to key cities were perceived to be too far; (3) Operational costs in Cyberjaya were perceived as high; (4) The Cyberjaya ecosystem lacks attractive incentives; and (5) Most of the current and potential MSC firms, customers and suppliers were already located outside Cyberjaya with existing networks of people and facilities in other locations. (6) The current environment of the MSC was also found not to be conducive to facilitating a self-organizing system due to the lack of a wide consultative and participatory process. Consequently, drastic changes to the organizational structure and behaviour are needed before success can happen. It was found that the key challenges and barriers to the transformation process in and through the MSC lie in the nature of the existing mindset, the operational practice, culture and power structural arrangements within and among the policy, people and institutions of the MSC. Discussion on the MSC tends to be centred on the technological and commercial without recognizing that technological change relies on concomitant social and political shifts. By succumbing to technology driven views and 'information society' rhetoric, policy makers are allowing real economic and social choices to be smothered. This dissertation argues that instead of presenting technology as something which is external to the society, with a dynamics of its own, and to which society must learn to adapt, effective debate about new technology must acknowledge the related political choices, power relationships and value judgments about the shape and direction of the society using the technology. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop policies to ensure that the economic benefits and social engineering associated with Malaysia&#146;s knowledge economy are managed through participatory and partnership methods at all levels of the country. This research has shown that complex systems analysis can lay the groundwork for a new approach that more accurately represents societal choices and outcomes than past approaches. Few researchers have undertaken complex systems analyses of social systems, with still fewer examining the context of a national public IT policy in a developing country like Malaysia. Further, there are very few thorough public studies done of the MSC itself, with most studies on the MSC either being done in confidence and/or being conducted by foreign consultants appointed by the government or by the Multimedia Development Corporation (MDC). As such, public accessibility to critical studies on the MSC or public documents on them is rarely available. This research, if not the first, is one of the first attempts made to provide a thorough constructive critical study on the MSC policy project since its official launch in 1996. It is also, if not the first, one of the first attempts made to apply the emerging paradigm or the new science of complexity in a real world national policy case study, specifically the MSC policy project. Moreover, there is a huge lacking of research done on behalf of 'marginalized communities'. This research is not carried out on behalf of private enterprise or national governments but rather it is done on behalf of its citizens.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">360203 Research, Science and Technology Policy</field><field name="subject">729901 Technological and organisational innovation</field><field name="subject">Multimedia Super Corridor</field><field name="subject">MSC</field><field name="subject">Malaysia</field><field name="subject">Complexity</field><field name="subject">IT Policy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157967</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Capability-based Description and Discovery of Services</field><field name="creator">Devereux, Drew</field><field name="description">Whenever autonomous entities work together to meet each other's needs, there arises the problem of how an entity with a need can find and use entities with the capability to meet that need. This problem is seen in Web service architectures, agent systems, and data integration systems, among others. Solutions have been proposed in each of these fields, but they are all dependent on implementation and interface. Hence all are restricted to their particular field, and all require their participants to conform to certain assumptions about implementation and interface. This failure of support for service autonomy is conceptually unattractive and impractical. In this thesis we show how to describe and matchmake service capabilities and client needs in a way that is implementation and interface independent. The result is a service discovery solution that fully supports the rights of services to choose their own implementation and interface. Our representation is capable of capturing capabilities across a range of service types, from Web services to agents to data sources, while ignoring the implementation and interface details that distinguish them. Thus, our solution unifies these fields for description and discovery purposes, allowing data sources with complex language interfaces to compete against form-based Web services and frame-and-slot agents, for example. Moreover, our solution captures all of the most important aspects of capability, such as: the conceptual meaning and limitations on what a service can achieve; what requests can be expressed through a service's interface, and limitations on what attributes of information a service can return. The provision of an interface independent capability description raises the additional question of how to enable a client to invoke the service to which it has been matched, and correctly interpret the results returned; we solve this by providing an interface description that maps from client objectives onto invocations, and from returned results onto a canonical result format.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280107 Global Information Systems</field><field name="subject">700102 Application tools and system utilities</field><field name="subject">semantic Web</field><field name="subject">capability</field><field name="subject">data integration</field><field name="subject">Web services</field><field name="subject">agents</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157966</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study on diffusion and flow of sub-critical hydrocarbons in activated carbon</field><field name="creator">BAE, Jun-Seok</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with diffusion and flow of sub-critical hydrocarbons in activated carbon by using a differential permeation method. The hydrocarbons are selected according to the effect on environmental concerns and their unique characteristics such as polarity and affinity towards activated carbon. Although it has been known that transport processes in activated carbon consist of Knudsen diffusion, gaseous viscous flow, adsorbed phase diffusion (so called, surface diffusion) and condensate flow, there have been no rigorous models to describe the transport processes in activated carbon with a full range of pressures. In particular among the four processes, the mechanism of adsorbed phase diffusion in activated carbon is still far from complete understanding. Also due to the dispersion interactions between adsorbing molecules and the solid surface, one would expect that Knudsen diffusion is influenced by the dispersive forces. From intensive experimental observations with a great care over a full range of pressures, conventional methods (for example, direct estimation from inert gas experiments) to determine adsorbed phase diffusion are found to be inadequate for strongly adsorbing vapors in activated carbon. By incorporating the effect of adsorbate-adsorbent interactions into Knudsen diffusivity, the general behavior of adsorbed phase diffusion in terms of pressure (or surface loading) can be obtained, showing a significant role in transport at low pressures. For non-polar hydrocarbons such as benzene, carbon tetrachloride and n-hexane, a mathematical model, which accounts for the effects of adsorbate-adsorbent interactions and pore size distribution, is formulated and validated, resulting in a good agreement with experimental data. Moreover, the adsorption and dynamic behaviors of alcohol molecules (which are polar compounds) are investigated with an aim to compare their behaviors against those of non-polar compounds.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">670700 Industrial Chemicals and Related Products</field><field name="subject">surface diffusion</field><field name="subject">hydrocarbons</field><field name="subject">activated carbon</field><field name="subject">transport phenomena</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157965</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Establishing the efficacy of telemedicine as a clinical tool for physiotherapists: From systems design to a randomised controlled trial</field><field name="creator">Russell, Trevor Glen</field><field name="description">High quality health services are often difficult to access in rural and remote areas of Australia. This is due to a shortage of health care professionals and specialists, inadequate and poorly distributed resources, and the tyranny of distance. The result is a reduced level of health and a higher mortality rate than seen in urban communities. Telemedicine, which is the use of various technologies to deliver a range of health care services over a distance, has the potential to increase equity and access to health care in rural and remote areas. To date there has been a poor uptake of telemedicine technology within the profession of physiotherapy. This undoubtedly stems from the perceived, and indeed, real difficulty of performing what is traditionally &#145;hands on&#146; therapy, via an electronic medium. Added to this is a paucity of rigorous clinical outcome studies to demonstrate the efficacy of performing successful treatment via this delivery method. The aim of this thesis was to establish the efficacy of telemedicine as a clinical tool for physiotherapists. To achieve this, the first major undertaking was the development of a telemedicine system to meet the unique needs of clinical physiotherapists and their patients. A series of studies was then performed to calibrate the system and establish its validity and reliability as a clinical assessment tool. Finally, a randomised controlled trial was conducted to assess the treatment efficacy of the telemedicine system. The telemedicine system was constructed using a human systems development approach, with close consultation with senior clinical physiotherapists and potential users of the system. The personal computer-based system was designed to connect patients in their home with physiotherapists in the hospital, via low-speed and low-cost communications. The system incorporated real-time videoconferencing and physical measurement tools to enable the remote assessment of patients. The validity and reliability of the telemedicine physical measurement tools were established through a series of five studies. The results demonstrated these measurements to be accurate and reliable, under various measurement conditions, when compared to reference instruments. A prospective randomised controlled trial was conducted to assess the treatment efficacy of the telemedicine system. The research model chosen for this study was the rehabilitation of subjects who had undergone total knee replacement surgery. Block randomisation was used to assign 65 participants to either a traditional face-to-face therapy group or a telemedicine rehabilitation group. Participants in both groups received treatment over a six week period. Data analysis focussed on comparing physical and functional rehabilitation outcomes achieved in each treatment group. The results of this study demonstrated that the rehabilitation outcomes produced via the telemedicine system were similar to those achieved in the traditional manner. Additionally, the telemedicine therapy was found to produce greater improvements in a number of functional outcome measurements. A high level of satisfaction was expressed by participants who received treatment via the telemedicine method. This thesis provides evidence of the efficacy of telemedicine as a clinical tool for physiotherapists. Furthermore, the work detailed in this thesis represents one of the first randomised control trials in telerehabilitation and makes a significant contribution towards the knowledge of low-bandwidth telemedicine in general. This thesis provides a framework upon which further research and telemedicine applications may be developed, with the ultimate goal of improving equity and access to high quality health services in rural and remote areas.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="subject">telemedicine</field><field name="subject">telerehabilitation</field><field name="subject">telehealth</field><field name="subject">physiotherapy</field><field name="subject">physical therapy</field><field name="subject">rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">total knee replacement</field><field name="subject">total knee arthroplasty</field><field name="subject">rural</field><field name="subject">remote</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157964</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on charcoal rot of mungbean</field><field name="creator">Fuhlbohm, Michael John</field><field name="description">The fungus Macrophomina phaseolina is the causal agent of several diseases of mungbean (Vigna radiata). One of these diseases, known as charcoal rot, causes spoilage of germinating seed lots, and occurs when seed contaminated with M. phaseolina is used for sprouting. The detection of the pathogen during seed testing prior to export leads to downgrading of the seed and a resultant financial penalty to the grain grower. The aims of this research were: to determine the location of M. phaseolina in diseased and symptomless tissue of mungbean plants; to determine the mode, site and timing of seed colonisation of mungbean; to determine the impact of biotic and abiotic factors on seed colonisation; to conduct an assessment of genotypic variation of M. phaseolina within single plants; to determine modes of transport of inoculum that contribute to foliage infection and seed colonisation of mungbean; and to assess both pre- and post-harvest management strategies in order to reduce or prevent seed colonisation, or to minimise the process of seed transmission. The location of M. phaseolina in mungbean plants was determined through serial sectioning of, and subsequent isolation from, naturally infected host tissue. A large proportion of the mungbean tissue infected by M. phaseolina was found to be symptomless. Moreover, there were large areas of ostensibly pathogen-free tissue separating infection foci, thus indicating a strong likelihood of independent aerial infections. A selection of 14 isolates obtained from serial sectioning were assessed for genotypic variation with six primers using RAPD analysis. Of the 36 bands that were scored, 78% were polymorphic and as a result, 12 distinct genotypes were detected. Polymorphisms were also detected amongst isolates obtained from the same discrete infection area on single plants, which strongly suggests the occurrence of multiple aerial infections. Various methods of controlled inoculation including soil infestation, pod and foliar inoculations, and artificial seed infestation, were used to determine how mungbean seeds are colonised by M. phaseolina. Additionally, most of these inoculation methods were coupled with a series of abiotic treatments (temperature regimes, watering regimes, application of herbicides) that were designed to initiate stress conditions within infected plants, and possibly trigger growth of M. phaseolina from the infection courts and colonise seed. Seed colonisation was established in vitro and in vivo when immature pods were directly inoculated with microsclerotia of M. phaseolina. At least two days exposure at 100% relative humidity (RH) was necessary to establish seed infection in detached mungbean pods that were inoculated with microsclerotia of M. phaseolina. Extensive seed infection was still obtained when one or more days of 100% RH was interrupted by up to three days at low humidity. All except one of the other methods of controlled inoculation failed to produce colonised seed even when combinations of stresses were applied. Only when the bipyridylium herbicide &#145;Spray Seed 250&#146; was applied to plants following the inoculation of mungbean stems within 13 cm of the pods, was seed colonised by M. phaseolina. This result raises the possibility that delayed harvesting of desiccated mungbean crops may promote further colonisation of mungbean tissue, including seed. Very strong evidence for the colonisation of mungbean seeds after deposition of soil-splashed inoculum of M. phaseolina onto pods was obtained through field and laboratory-based studies. Soil-splashed inoculum (most likely microsclerotia) was also found to be the source of inoculum responsible for the development of Macrophomina leaf blight of mungbean at several regional sites. To further investigate this finding, areas of several mungbean crops growing in naturally infested soil were covered in hessian cloth to prevent soil-splash and assessments of the levels of seed colonisation between covered and uncovered areas were made. Although colonisation of seed in the covered areas was significantly lower than in the uncovered areas, covering the soil did not eliminate colonisation of seed. This result suggests that inoculum dispersal, leading to pod infection and subsequent seed colonisation, occurs not only in splashed-soil but also by other means. Soil transported to the extra-floral nectaries of mungbeans by ants was found to contain infective inoculum of M. phaseolina. Furthermore, air-borne debris and dust collected in a trap contained viable microsclerotia of the pathogen. Isolates of M. phaseolina collected from both sources were pathogenic on mungbean seedlings, and suspensions of ant-transported soil and air-borne dust/debris infected mungbean pods and seed. This is the first report of both modes of inoculum dispersal. All three modes undoubtedly contribute to the total level of colonised seed, but their relative importance remains to be determined. Several options for the management of charcoal rot in mungbean seeds were investigated. Application of the fungicide carbendazim to mungbean plants after flowering significantly decreased, but did not prevent, colonisation of mungbean seed by M. phaseolina. Consequently, this method of management holds little promise for mungbean growers. A large number of weeds common in Australian mungbean fields were newly reported as hosts of M. phaseolina. Isolates obtained from the infected, but symptomless weeds were pathogenic on mungbean seedlings, thus indicating a lack of host-specificity toward mungbean. It is strongly suspected that the use of herbicides to control weeds in reduced and zero-tillage farming systems is increasing the risk of infection in subsequent mungbean crops through the build-up of inoculum in soil. This increased risk of infection may be further exacerbated by retaining stubble infested with M. phaseolina on the soil surface, thereby increasing the amount of inoculum that could be splashed onto plant organs. Surface sterilisation, using sodium hypochlorite, significantly reduced colonisation levels in heavily colonised mungbean seed lines, but the process was not enhanced when a partial-vacuum was introduced to the process. In some seed lots, up to 32% of the seed was colonised only on the seed coat (defined here as contamination), whereas the remainder was internally infected. Surface sterilisation also reduced the overall colonisation of 132 commercial lines by approximately one-third. Storage of seed for one month at either 4&#176;C or 15&#176;C significantly reduced colonisation levels in seed, whereas freezing treatments did not. Eradication of M. phaseolina from mungbean seed was possible through thermotherapy. However, the conditions required for eradication also contributed to large increases in abnormal germination levels and large losses in overall germination - an unacceptable trade-off for sprouters. A combination of thermotherapy and surface sterilisation of colonised mungbean seed may provide a more efficient process of seed treatment.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270403 Plant Pathology</field><field name="subject">620108 Grain legumes</field><field name="subject">pulse</field><field name="subject">fungus</field><field name="subject">disease</field><field name="subject">conservation farming</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157963</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Direct and correlated responses to selection in large white pigs for growth rate on restricted feeding</field><field name="creator">Nguyen Hong Nguyen, Nguyen</field><field name="description">Responses in growth rate, food conversion efficiency, carcass composition, residual food intake, meat quality and reproduction traits to selection in pigs for four years, for high or low post-weaning growth rate on a fixed but restricted ration were measured in progeny grown on either restricted, ad libitum individual or ad libitum group feeding regimens. Genetic and phenotypic correlations among the traits were also examined on animals whose full pedigrees comprised a total of 5324 animals. Substantial divergent response was achieved from selection for high vs. low growth rate on restricted feeding, with the genetic means of daily gain diverging by 81.25 g or 2.78 genetic standard deviations (SigmaG). The high and low growth rate lines also differed in ultrasonic backfat and food conversion efficiency by 1.12 SigmaG and 0.84 SigmaG, and by 0.88 SigmaG, 1.10 SigmaG, and 1.14 SigmaG for carcass weight daily gain, carcass fat and lean percentage, respectively. These responses were consistent with the moderately to highly, favourable genetic correlations among and between performance and carcass composition traits. Genetic changes in growth rate, ultrasonic backfat, food conversion ratio, carcass daily gain, carcass fat and lean percentage when measured on ad libitum individual feeding were all economically beneficial. The high growth line had a significantly lower voluntary daily food intake and residual food intake than the contemporaneous low line, indicating a reduced energy requirement for maintenance in the high relative to the low line. Genetic correlations between either growth rate or backfat and carcass traits were favourable but unfavourable between daily food intake and carcass fat or lean percentage, implying that selection strategies which place emphasis on increased leanness and decreased fatness would result in a decline in voluntary food intake of the animals. The descendants of breeding pigs selected for high post-weaning daily gain on restricted feeding showed significantly increased growth rates, slaughter weights and carcase lean percentages and reduced fatness when grown in group housing with ad libitum feeding. This suggests that restricted feeding is an effective performance testing approach for seedstock lines supplying commercial regimens with group housing and ad libitum feeding. Carcase lean pH values measured 24 hours post-mortem (pH24) were not statistically different between the selected lines, suggesting that an increase in basal metabolic rate due to increased rate of lean deposition in the high relative to the low line may have been compensated for by a reduction in heat production from other sources such as physical activity. Such a reduction was evidenced by a lower residual food intake in the high than the low growth lines. This supports the hypothesis that selection for high growth rate on restricted feeding does not have detrimental effects on pork quality. The sows of the high growth line produced more piglets with significantly heavier weights at birth, giving a potential for better post-natal growth and higher yield of pork weaned per sow per year than the low growth sows. Body weights of the high line sows prior to mating were also significantly higher than those of low line sows suggesting earlier age of sexual maturity. A non-significant tendency for high line sows to have a lower voluntary food intake than low line sows pointed to the possibility that their lower maintenance requirement as growers was carried over to the lactational phase of life. It is concluded that selection for high growth rate on a restricted ration of fixed amount will produce pig strains with a high genetic potential for lean growth, reduced energy requirement for maintenance and improved reproductive performance, and which will be suitable for growing under a wide range of commercial feeding environments.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">279999 Biological Sciences not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">630105 Pigs</field><field name="subject">divergent selection</field><field name="subject">responses</field><field name="subject">genetic parameters</field><field name="subject">white pigs</field><field name="subject">restricted feeding</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157962</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Viola da Gamba Music of the Berlin School, 1732-1772</field><field name="creator">O'Loghlin, Michael Andrew</field><field name="description">The name &#147;Berlin School&#148; refers to the group of composers who worked in the orchestra of Frederick the Great in Berlin. The first musicians were engaged in 1732, and the group expanded rapidly to its full strength of about 42 after Frederick&#146;s coronation in 1740. All of the most significant composers were engaged in the first 10 years. Most of these composers wrote music for the viola da gamba, an instrument which by 1740 was already becoming obsolete in most places. The gamba composers are C. P. E. Bach, F. Benda, C. H. Graun, J. G. Graun, J. G. Janitsch and C. Schaffrath. They were encouraged to write for the viola da gamba by the presence in the orchestra from 1741 of Ludwig Christian Hesse, one of the last great virtuosi of the viola da gamba. Hesse was taught by his father Ernst Christian Hesse, who studied the French style in Paris. Hesse junior brought the French style to Berlin, where the Berlin School composers produced a synthesis of French and Italian styles by applying French textural techniques, some of them specific to the viola da gamba, to Italian forms. This study shows how the unique situation which existed in Berlin produced the last major corpus of music written for the viola da gamba. This music was the result of close collaboration between Hesse and the Berlin School composers.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410101 Music</field><field name="subject">750201 The performing arts (incl. music, theatre and dance)</field><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">Darmstadt</field><field name="subject">performance practice</field><field name="subject">sonata</field><field name="subject">concerto</field><field name="subject">cantata</field><field name="subject">violin</field><field name="subject">Amalien-Bibliothek</field><field name="subject">Staatsbibliothek</field><field name="subject">solo</field><field name="subject">duet</field><field name="subject">trio</field><field name="subject">quartet</field><field name="subject">Versuch</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157961</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Taxonomy and Biology of benedeniine capsalid monogeneans</field><field name="creator">Deveney, Marty R.</field><field name="description">Abstract The Benedeniinae, the largest of nine capsalid subfamilies, includes genera with an aseptate, apapillate haptor and a pair of discrete testes. Eight of 13 nominal benedeniine genera, Benedenia Diesing, 1858 (the type genus); Allobenedenia Yamaguti, 1963; Allometabenedeniella Velasquez, 1982; Dioncopseudobenedenia Yamaguti, 1965; Lagenivaginopseudobenedenia Yamaguti, 1966; Oligoncobenedenia Yamaguti, 1965; Pseudallobenedenia Yamaguti, 1966 and Tareenia, Hussey, 1986 are revised using type material of most nominal species with observations for some species from new material. Allobenedenia and Allometabenedeniella are transferred to the Trochopodinae Price, 1936 emend. Sproston, 1946 because all valid species of both genera bear septa on the ventral haptor surface. Allobenedenia ishikawae (Goto, 1894) Yamaguti, 1963 is transferred to Benedenia because its haptor is aseptate. I recognize Menziesia Gibson, 1976, based on the form of the male copulatory organ and associated structures and include five species in it. Tareenia Hussey, 1986 is synonymised with Benedenia because characters used to differentiate the two genera do not indicate discontinuities at the generic level. Benedeniella Johnston, 1929, Calicobenedenia Kritsky and Fennessy, 1999 and Trimusculotrema Whittington and Barton, 1990 are considered to belong in Entobdellinae Bychowsky, 1957, pending further studies on that group. The anatomy of Calicobenedenia is outlined briefly; the other genera are not discussed here in detail. Lachishia n. g. is described, based on the structure of the male copulatory organ and a species is transferred to it from Dioncopseudobenedenia. I describe four new species of benedeniines from teleosts caught at Heron and Green Islands, Australia namely: Benedenia ernsti n. sp. from the gills of Symphorus nematophorus; Benedenia fieldsi n. sp. from the fins of Cephalopholis boenak, C. cyanostigma and C. miniatus; Benedenia haywardi n. sp. from the skin of S. nematophorus and Dioncopsudobenedenia ancoralis n. sp. from the gills of Siganus lineatus. Benedenia akaisaki Iwata, 1990 is synonymised with B. ovata (Goto, 1894) Johnston, 1929, B. kintoki Iwata, 1990 is synonymised with B. elongata (Yamaguti, 1968) Egorova, 1997, B. sargocentron Zhang, Yang and Liu, 2001 is synonymised with B. hawaiiensis Yamaguti, 1968 and Pseudallobenedenia arabica Timofeeva, 1995 is synonymised with P. opakapaka Yamaguti, 1966. Benedenia madai Ishii and Sawada, 1938, B. pagrosomi Ishii and Sawada, 1938 and Allobenedenia pedunculata Raju and Rao, 1980 are considered species inquirendae. I examined an outbreak in aquaculture of the pathogenic benedeniine, Neobenedenia melleni (MacCallum, 1927) Yamaguti, 1963 and report this species for the first time in Australia. I examined the pathogenesis caused by this parasite by histology of host tissue. Possible routes of introduction to the farm in question are investigated and studies are detailed that should be undertaken in Australia to manage future outbreaks of N. melleni. Capsalids usually colonise new hosts by an infective ciliated oncomiracidium. An experiment was conducted to ascertain whether cleaner fish Labroides dimidiatus could transfer adult skin-parasitic monogeneans from one host fish to another. I have shown that transmission of adult monogeneans between two individuals of Hemigymnus melapterus by cleaner fish can occur. In coral reef environments, frequent contact between unrelated hosts involved in cleaning interactions might create previously unsuspected evolutionary pressures. I discuss the implications of this discovery for host-specificity and lateral transmission of monogeneans. General biological studies of monogeneans are necessary to understand the evolution, pathology, epidemiology, phylogeny and taxonomy of these parasites. My study provides a taxonomic system which, when applied to other capsalid subfamilies, should help prevent errors and create a clear system of classification for the entire family.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270299 Genetics not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Benedeniinae</field><field name="subject">Capsalidae</field><field name="subject">taxonomy</field><field name="subject">parasite</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157960</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis Towards the Spiroacetal Substructure of Didemnaketal A</field><field name="creator">Suthers, Bill Derek</field><field name="description">A wide variety of natural products have been isolated from Didemnum species of ascidians, and a survey of such compounds is presented. The didemnaketals are the only spiroacetal containing natural products to be elaborated by this genus, with didemnaketal A showing the greatest activity against HIV-1 protease. General synthetic approaches to the spiroacetal moiety are discussed, and then applied in retrosynthetic analyses of the spiroacetal portion of didemnaketal A. Synthesis towards this spiroacetal portion is reported, with the products being characterised by detailed 2D NMR spectroscopy and other methods. The relative stereochemistry at C12, C14, C16, C18 and C20 in the natural product is established. Further extensions of the synthesis are discussed. Two models of the E,F bicyclic portion of the shellfish poison, pinnatoxin D, are synthesised, and characterised by detailed 2D NMR analysis. The relative stereochemistry at C27, C29 and C30 is established by this synthetic work, and is in agreement with that based only on NMR analyses.

A review of the background and current situation of the pig and poultry industries in SC revealed that they are well organised into vertically integrated production systems and are regarded as being very competitive in world markets from technical and economic points of view. In 2002, SC produced 24% of total pork and 20% of total chicken production in Brazil in 2002, but this State has an area of only 95,000 km2, which amounts to just 1.1% of the country. SC also contributed 66% of pork exports and 54% of poultry exports from Brazil in 2002. So far the pig and poultry industries in SC have developed successfully, but recent changes towards more intensive production methods have resulted in much concern being expressed by the community, as the environmental impact of waste produced in the region has increased. The review of literature showed that in order to be sustainable, the pig and poultry industries in SC should acknowledge the concept of the &#147;triple bottom line&#148; and the principles of ecologically sustainable development. These include (i) biophysical or environmental sustainability, (ii) economic viability and (iii) social sustainability as criteria to guide industry development. The sustainability of the pig and poultry industries is influenced by local, regional, national and global factors which operate on several scales, and which in turn, indicate the need to use a multi-dimensional approach, combining environmental, economic, and social attributes. This study used a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods and was completed in four phases. In the first phase, an electronic survey of 205 stakeholders (complemented by 60 interviews with farmers) was undertaken to identify their views and perceptions of what sustainability meant to them. The survey was also designed to obtain stakeholders&#146; views on a suggested list of sustainability indicators. In Phase 2, the findings of the e-survey were discussed with panels of key industry stakeholders in 4 focus group discussions with of 47 participants to develop the list of indicators. In the third phase, a streamlined Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study was conducted, to quantify the flows of materials, energy and of natural resource uses and to assess environmental impact. Finally, in Phase 4, stakeholder feedback was sought in 9 meetings to discuss and refine preliminary results and conclusions from the previous three phases of work. In the LCA the environmental burdens produced by typical intensive pig and poultry production systems were quantified and the contribution to each of nine selected environmental effects was estimated. The functional units (FU) were 1 tonne of live weight (LW) of pigs and 1 tonne of LW of chickens delivered to the gate of the abattoir. The boundaries of the systems analysed included the processes of producing fertilisers, feed products (maize and soybeans), energy, fuel, pesticides, production of rations, production of pigs and chickens and transportation required during all stages until the pigs and chickens are delivered to the abattoir. Data were collected from a variety of sources, including pig and poultry industry operators, research institutions, and agribusiness analysts from SC, as well as publicly available databases. Identified environmental hotspots in pig production were greenhouse gas emissions, acidification, and eutrophication, particularly from ration production and waste management. Environmental hotspots for poultry production reflect the high use of energy and pesticides, particularly associated with ration production from soybeans. The study concluded that although economic performance is competitive in world markets, most producers were operating outside the boundaries of sustainability because of inadequate waste management and excessive waste produced in a small geographical area, beyond the assimilation capacity of the local environment. This also causes other environmental effects (such as offensive odours, and increased numbers of blackflies, and houseflies), which were not quantified in the LCA study, but which were regarded as very important issues by stakeholders in the survey and focus group discussions. While comparing the overall environmental impact of producing 1 FU of pigs and poultry, this study concluded that under current production systems, pigs cause 68% greater impact than chickens. The key indicators proposed to assess the sustainability of the pig and poultry industries in SC were grouped into physical or environmental, economic, and social indicators. For physical and environmental indicators, monitoring the natural resource condition is the key indicator and requires measurement of attributes such as manure load per area of land and nutrient balance (P and K), soil condition, water use and water quality, agricultural plant species diversity, impact on native vegetation, and chemical residues in products. Among the economic indicators, long-term real net farm income and the industries&#146; overall competitiveness in national and international markets are key indicators. Attributes to measure these indicators are real net farm income, cost of production, farmer&#146;s terms of trade, total factor productivity, and disposable income per farm household. Other farm level technical indicators which influence the economic outcome, such as feed conversion and productivity indices for pigs and poultry, also need to be monitored. For social indicators, the age structure and gender balance of the agricultural workforce, farmers&#146; managerial skills and level of training, as well as access to basic services, such as health, education, communications, and electricity in rural communities, are the key sustainability indicators. This study made four main contributions to knowledge: (a) the views and perceptions about sustainability among pig and poultry stakeholders were identified; (b) the environmental impacts of pig and poultry production were quantified and compared; (c) a set of key sustainability indicators for the pig and poultry industries was developed and validated; and (d) a framework for change towards sustainability and policy guidelines were suggested. The overall conclusion of the study is that, to be sustainable, the pig and poultry industries need to adjust their management practices, policies, and development strategies to incorporate the principles of ecologically sustainable development. Feeding strategies and methods of grain production have much influence on the key points of environmental impact, such as global warming, pesticides, and energy consumption. Waste management, however, has the greatest local impact, because of water and soil pollution and reduction in the quality of life due to offensive odours, blackflies, and houseflies. Sustainability indicators can thus assist to drive the industries to adopt improvements in the production systems to achieve better environmental performance. Although the findings of this study are confined to SC, the principles are generally applicable to other similar livestock industries in other places. The main justification for conducting this study rests on the increasing demands by the government, community and industry stakeholders for initiatives to reduce the impact of the pig and poultry production on the environment, while maintaining and enhancing its economic competitiveness in global markets and continuing to deliver important social benefits.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sustainability indicators</field><field name="subject">agriculture</field><field name="subject">pigs</field><field name="subject">poultry</field><field name="subject">environmental impact</field><field name="subject">externalities</field><field name="subject">Life Cycle Assessment.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157958</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing the incidence of dystocia in beef heifers</field><field name="creator">Norman, Scott</field><field name="description">Research reported in this thesis was designed to quantify the impact of dystocia in heifers on beef cattle production in the Waggamba Shire of Southeast Queensland in the early 1990?s. The research was also designed to identify factors influencing the incidence of dytocia in beef heifers. It was found that the average beef cattle breeding property in the Waggamba Shire at the commencement of this study was 2090&amp;plusmn;7.7 hectares and ran a total of 336&amp;plusmn;1.6 breeders, of which 78&amp;plusmn;1.1 were heifers. A large proportion (66%) of the breeders were either Hereford or Shorthorn. Seventy nine percent of properties had a 4&amp;plusmn;0.24 month joining period falling between the months of September to March. All properties incorporated one or more of the subjective appraisal criteria of frame size, temperament, age and "soundness of type" when selecting heifers for joining. Nineteen percent of properties weighed heifers prior to joining to assess if critical mating weight had been attained. Forty percent of properties routinely had pregnancy diagnosis performed. The mean percent of calves weaned from the heifers that were pregnancy tested in calf was 81.9%. In the cow herd the mean percentage of calves weaned from pregnancy tested cows was 95.8%. The mean incidence of dystocia in heifers from surveyed properties was estimated to be 10% with a mean of 1.6% of heifers dying from dystocia each year. A mean of 13 working days was spent observing or assisting heifers each calving season. A benefit-cost analysis, incorporating a gross margin analysis and net present value calculations showed there was a $0.13 increase in the gross margin per hectare for each percentage decrease in the dystocia rate, representing an increase in the annual total gross margin of approximately $272 for each percent decrease in heifer dystocia for a 2090 hectare Waggamba Shire beef cattle property. Net present value calculations revealed that over a ten-year period, a property with five-percent dystocia in the heifers would have $34.81 per hectare extra income than a property with 40 % dystocia. This equated to $72440 extra income for an average sized Waggamba Shire property of 2090 hectares at the end of ten years. A significantly higher mean birth weight for calves requiring veterinary assistance for delivery compared to unassisted calves (p&lt;0.01) was found. Examination of pelvic area data showed that assisted heifers delivering male calves had significantly larger mean pelvic areas and higher pelvic area:calf birth weight ratios than assisted heifers delivering female calves (p&lt;0.01). It was found that male calves required a larger pelvic area for delivery compared to female calves, and also needed, on average, an extra 1.94 cm2 of pelvic area per kilogram of calf compared to the females. Results also showed that heifers requiring assistance had significantly higher body condition scores at calving (p&lt;0.01). Heifers delivering male calves had a significantly higher mean body condition score than those delivering female calves (p&lt;0.05). Results from analysing seasonal effects showed that calvings for which veterinary assistance was sought occurred significantly earlier in the calving season compared to unassisted calves (p&lt;0.05). A retrospective study showed a positive correlation between yearling heifer body weight and yearling heifer pelvic area (p&lt;0.01, r=0.29). This demonstrated a mean increase in yearling heifer pelvic area of 0.174 cm2 for each 1kg increase in body weight. The r2 value indicated that 8.9% of the variation in yearling heifer pelvic area was accounted for by changes in heifer body weight. The mean yearling pelvic area of heifers requiring assistance at calving was 182.2 &amp;plusmn; 3.1cm2 compared to 193.5 &amp;plusmn; 1.2 cm2 for heifers not requiring assistance. The difference of 11.3 cm2 was significantly different from zero (p&lt;0.01). The mean Pelvic Area : Birth Weight ratios for assisted and unassisted calvings were 5.4 &amp;plusmn; 0.01 cm2/kg and 6.6 &amp;plusmn; 0.08 cm2/kg respectively and were significantly different (p&lt;0.01). Calf birth weight was not significantly correlated with the heifers? yearling body weight. However, the type of delivery when calving as a two-year-old was significantly affected by the heifers? weight as a yearling (p&lt;0.01). For the sub-population where yearling heifer body weight was measured, the mean yearling weight for the 63 heifers having calving difficulty as two-year-olds was 254&amp;plusmn;5.3 kg, compared to 284.5&amp;plusmn;2.95 kg for the 227 heifers not requiring assistance. The percentage of assisted calvings for the whole heifer population studied was 16.8%. For the sub-population where birth weight was measured, the mean calf birth weights for the 140 assisted and 655 unassisted calvings were 33.6&amp;plusmn;0.36 kg and 31.0&amp;plusmn;0.17 kg respectively and were significantly different (p&lt;0.01). Analysis of variance revealed calf birth weight was significantly different (p&lt;0.01) between males and females (32.2&amp;plusmn;0.25 kg compared to 29.9&amp;plusmn;0.21 kg respectively). Of the assisted calvings, 65% were male calves. The mean second trimester rainfall for assisted and unassisted calvings was 86.5&amp;plusmn;6.0 mm and 110.4&amp;plusmn;2.8 mm respectively. Chi-squared analysis showed an association between assisted birth numbers and rainfall category in the second trimester (X2 =13.4, p&lt;0.01, df=1). There was also a significant association between assisted birth numbers and rainfall category in the third trimester (X2 = 11.9, p&lt;0.01, df=1). The differences resulted from significantly more heifers requiring assistance when rainfall in the second trimester was less than the mean, and rainfall in the third trimester was greater than the mean. When all three trimesters were considered together, there was a significantly higher than expected number of assisted births for the High/Low/High and Low/Low/High groups of heifers (p&lt;0.01), where High and Low refers to whether rainfall was above or below the mean during the trimester under investigation. Analysis of variance revealed significant differences in mean calf birth weight between the High and Low rainfall groups in the first and third trimesters. Mean birth weights of calves from the Low first trimester rainfall group were 1.6kg heavier than those from the High first trimester rainfall group (p&lt;0.01), and mean birth weights of calves from the High third trimester rainfall group were 0.9kg heavier than those with low rainfall in the third trimester (p&lt;0.02). When the analysis focused on the upper and lower rainfall quartiles, the significant difference between mean calf birth weights when grouped by High or Low rainfall in the first trimester was maintained. Mean calf birth weights from heifers exposed to lower quartile rainfall in the first trimester were 3.2kg heavier than the upper quartile group (p&lt;0.01). This latter analysis failed to find a significant difference in mean calf birth weights between those exposed to different rainfall volume during the third trimester. In relation to month of calving, the mean calving dates for unassisted and assisted births of the 25th August and the 13th September respectively, were found to be significantly different (p&lt;0.01). The mean calving date for the whole group was the 28th August. Two studies comparing heifers fed from approximately three months of gestation to achieve a mean condition score of &lt; 3.5 at calving (Fat group), with those fed to achieve a condition score of &lt; 3.0 at calving (Thin group) showed no significant difference in dystocia incidence between groups. Assessment of blood parameters suggested that heifers from the Fat group had increased levels of stress and tissue trauma associated with parturition compared to heifers from the Thin group. Specifically, heifers in the Fat group had significantly higher postpartum plasma CPK concentrations (p&lt;0.05), significantly higher postpartum blood glucose concentrations (p&lt;0.05), a trend towards higher postpartum plasma fibrinogen concentrations (p=0.09) and significantly lower plasma normalised calcium concentrations (p&lt;0.01). Results revealed serum progesterone concentrations during gestation in the Thin group were significantly higher than in the Fat group at the May sampling time (p&lt;0.05) of the First trial and trended that way in August for the Second trial (p=0.07). There was a trend for serum progesterone concentrations to be higher in the Fat group 24 hours postpartum (p=0.07), with the difference becoming significant at 48 hours postpartum (p&lt;0.01). There were no differences in serum progesterone concentrations detected between the Fat and Thin groups at parturition. The presence of progesterone in subcutaneous fat was established, however there was no indication of it influencing serum progesterone concentrations during gestation or at calving. In the second trial, pelvic width was a mean of 0.6 cm wider in the Fat group compared to the Thin group at approximately two months prior to calving (p&lt;0.05). No significant group or group by measuring time interactions were noted for pelvic height or pelvic area measurements. There was a trend for heifers in the Thin group to produce heavier calves than heifers in the Fat group (p=0.1). Two final studies were undertaken to investigate whether the seasonal and nutritional influences on heifer calving ability identified in the previous studies might be associated with dietary protein concentration of the heifers in the first two trimesters. Heifers were divided into High/High, High/Low, Low/High and Low/Low groups according to the dietary protein concentration they received in the first and second trimesters respectively. In both trials, mean calf birth weights and the numbers of heifers experiencing dystocia were not significantly different between groups. In the second trial, calves from the Low/Low and Low/High groups had significantly larger left and right cannon bone lengths (p&lt;0.05). In the first trial the heifers in the High/High group had a greater mean pelvic height at the end of the first trimester (p&lt;0.05), and in the second trial there was a trend heifers in the High/High group to have a greater mean pelvic height and pelvic area at the end of the second trimester (p=0.1 and 0.08 respectively). A significantly larger mean frame score occurred in the High/High group (p&lt;0.05) of the second trial at the end of the second trimester. There was a trend for placental weights to be heavier for assisted calvings in both trials (p=0.07 and p=0.08 respectively). The correlation coefficient between placental weight and calf birth weight was significant (p&lt;0.01, r=0.71) and demonstrated a mean increase in calf birth weight of 2.6 kilograms for each 1 kg increase in placental weight. The r2 value indicated that approximately 50% of the variation in calf birth weight was accounted for by changes in placental weight. In the second trial, heifers in the High/Low group had a significantly lower placental weight (p&lt;0.05). When the data from the first trial was analysed based on delivery type, mean blood glutathione peroxidase activity was significant different, or had trends towards significance, between assisted and unassisted heifers throughout gestation except for one measurement at three months of gestation. Heifers requiring assisted deliveries had significantly higher GSH-Px activity at all of these times compared to unassisted contemporaries. Although this finding wasn't duplicated in the second trial, it was also not contradicted. In specifically addressing the aims of this study, it was concluded that the mean dystocia incidence in this district was approximately the same as that documented for beef heifers in previous studies. Dystocia caused significant economic loss to beef cattle production in this district. Factors identified by this study that were directly associated with increased dystocia incidence were: (a) Lower mean body weight of heifers at 12 months of age. (b) Lower mean pelvic area of heifers at 12 months of age. (c) Lower ratio of pelvic area of heifers at 12 months of age to calf birth weight. (d) Lower mean rainfall during the second trimester of gestation for heifers bred to calve as two-year-olds. (e) Higher mean body condition score at calving. (f) Higher mean calf birth weights. (g) Male calves. (h) A later mean calving date for heifers calving as two-year-olds. (i) Heavier placental weights at calving.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bovine</field><field name="subject">Cattle</field><field name="subject">Dystocia</field><field name="subject">Nutrition</field><field name="subject">Dystocia Management</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157957</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Open Quantum Dynamics of Mesoscopic Bose-Einstein Condensates</field><field name="creator">Corney, Joel Frederick</field><field name="description">The properties of an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well potential are investigated through a two-mode analysis. An analytic solution for the semiclassical tunnelling and self-trapping dynamics is compared with numerical simulations of the quantum dynamics, which exhibit collapses and revivals for a closed system. A continuous non-destructive measurement technique to monitor the Josephson tunnelling oscillations is presented, in which the condensate in one well dispersively shifts the phase of a coherent probe beam in proportion to atom-number. The evolution of the resulting homodyne photocurrent and Bloch Q distributions shows that oscillations develop even when the initial state possesses phase symmetry. The conditional dynamics of the condensate which result from measurement back-action also appear in certain semiclassical formulations. The homodyne measurement technique is incorporated into a proposed weak-force detector. A maximally entangled initial state, which is the ground state for a double condensate with strong attractive atomic interactions, enables a high-precision measurement. The dynamics of quantum many-body multimode systems of interacting bosons are simulated using phase-space methods. The use of the Wigner technique predicts novel noise effects in fibre solitons. The positive-P representation is used to simulate the formation of mesoscopic Bose-Einstein condensates via evaporative cooling in three dimensional atom traps. The results indicate highly non-classical behaviour near the critical point, and provide evidence for the spontaneous formation of vortices. Comparisons with corresponding mean-field calculations reveal large differences between the semiclassical and fully quantum results. Finally, the possibility of future progress with alternative phase-space methods is considered.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quantum physics</field><field name="subject">Bose-Einstein condensation</field><field name="subject">matter waves</field><field name="subject">quantum optics</field><field name="subject">atom optics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157955</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changing Complex Documents</field><field name="creator">Carter, Simon Matthew James</field><field name="description">Change management is a discipline fundamental to the task of building ever more complex computing systems. Properly managed change provides a means whereby alterations to existing components of a complex artefact and their relationships can be evaluated, managed and evolved. This thesis takes as its example Official RAAF Publications, some of which need to be revised as a result of changes to the system they describe. The thesis develops a model of change propagation providing a set of operations to examine and record the changes to a set of publications. Additional operations enable coping with reversing decisions and handling the unexpected arrival of externally generated amendments. The model is extended to cover a finer granularity of entities (at the page level) to determine whether this greater level of detail would ease some tasks. A further extension provides the notion of relationships between the publications of concern, focusing on a dependency relationship between two publications. This enables exploration of the possibility of improving the process by reducing the risk of missing publications needing revision and providing a means by which some tasks can be partly automated thus speeding up the process. The models presented were developed in Sum, a variant of the Z specification language, to gain greater insight into the essential details of the operations and data structures involved. By ignoring implementation details the essential logical steps of each model can be emphasised and their differences and similarities contrasted. This thesis demonstrates that fine-grained change management is feasible. The thesis develops processes that automatically track the status of changes as they are propagated through a set of documents. The greater knowledge of work done on individual pages allows only the page(s) of concern to be affected. The work also enables recommendations to be made as to the applicability of each model and, by comparing the models, provides insight into the amount of work and resources required for tackling change at different levels of granularity.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">280302 Software Engineering</field><field name="subject">700199 Computer software and services not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">change management</field><field name="subject">change propagation</field><field name="subject">fine-grained change management</field><field name="subject">formal methods</field><field name="subject">Sum specification language</field><field name="subject">Z specification language</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157953</field></doc><doc><field name="title">External and Internal Mass Transfer in Biological Wastewater Treatment Systems`</field><field name="creator">Gapes, Daniel James</field><field name="description">A detailed study has been carried out to demonstrate the importance of external and internal mass transfer on the nitrification rates in three distinct treatment processes: flocculent and granular activated sludge, and suspended carrier reactor (SCR) systems. The major emphasis was on external mass transfer, and the impact of system hydrodynamics on this mechanism. Laboratory-scale flocculent and granular sequencing batch reactors were operated for the nitrification of a synthetic wastewater. A two-stage, continuous, nitrifying SCR was operated using the same wastewater feed. Within each stage, biofilm was grown on two types of commercial carriers- the Natrix C10/10 from ANOX AB (Sweden); and the K1 carrier from Kaldnes Milj&#248;teknologi (Norway). Biofilm carriers obtained from each of these reactors was utilised for the mass transfer investigations. The major findings, and contributions of the work to the field of biological wastewater treatment, are described in the following paragraphs. In order to complete the work, a novel experimental tool, the TOGA (Titrimetric and Off-Gas Analysis) sensor was created, which utilises off-gas mass balancing, coupled with pH titration to provide detailed measurement of biological reaction rates. An original method for off-gas mass balancing was developed, within a reactor that allowed modification of the hydrodynamic conditions using gas phase mixing independent of dissolved oxygen control within the liquid phase. This sensor has already proven to be a highly effective tool not only for the measurement of oxygen but also for carbon dioxide and various nitrogen species, and has application for numerous other compounds present in the gas phase of biological reactors (e.g. hydrogen, methane). The application of the TOGA sensor signals to the nitrification process was demonstrated, which enabled the online measurement of oxygen, ammonia, and nitrite reaction rates. The TOGA sensor development underpinned the majority of the subsequent experimental work within this thesis. Dissolved oxygen microelectrodes were also used, enabling microscale measurements to be made in conjunction with the macroscale TOGA sensor analyses. Combined with size and microbiological analyses a detailed study of mass transfer and reaction was able to be carried out on the various systems. For suspended aggregate systems (flocs and granules): A spherical particle model was developed and used to predict the potential for external mass transfer limitation in flocs and granules. The significance of this limitation was confirmed experimentally, by observing changes in reaction rate or concentration boundary layer (in the TOGA sensor or microelectrode study, respectively) upon modification of the system&#146;s flow conditions. Despite this flow effect being small, and only observable under low bulk liquid substrate concentrations, the external mass transfer limitation was concluded to be significant for biological flocs and granules even at higher substrate concentrations. As particle size and the maximum volumetric reaction rate of the biomass increases, external mass transfer effects become increasingly significant. The work highlights the impact of mass transfer limitation on the measurement of Monod half saturation coefficients (KS) in flocs and granules. Without accounting for external or internal mass transfer limitation, KS is seriously overestimated and becomes a lumped parameter, reflecting not only the microbial response but also the mass transfer limitations observed within the system under study. To avoid confusion or generation of erroneous results, care should be taken in defining, measuring and utilising the half saturation coefficient in biological systems where the biomass is not present as individual cells or extremely small flocs. For Suspended Carrier Reactor systems: External and internal mass transfer are both concluded to be important rate limiting steps within suspended carrier reactors. The demonstration of a significant impact of fluid flow conditions on the nitrification rates highlights the impact of external mass transfer limitation within these systems. Application of a one-dimensional biofilm model to the experimental results led to the conclusion that there is little difference between the external mass transfer limitation of the two different carrier types, for carriers grown under the same environmental conditions. However, there was a significantly higher areal nitrification rate observed on the Natrix carriers compared to the Kaldnes carriers. It is the biofilm structure that is critically important in characterising the mass transfer steps. Systems operated under high nitrogen loads, producing filamentous biofilms on the carrier surface, were found to have larger external mass transfer coefficients and responses to changes in fluid flow than those carriers which were operated under nitrogen-limited conditions (producing a flatter, more gel-like biofilm). The structure of the biofilm colonising the carrier surface was far more important in defining the mass transfer coefficient than the actual carrier type used. In a remarkably similar trend to that of the external mass transfer coefficient, the biofilm morphology was again significantly more important than carrier type in determining both the magnitude and response to fluid flow of the gas-liquid mass transfer coefficient for oxygen (kLa) calculated within the laboratory TOGA sensor. These findings led to the postulation that direct gas-biofilm interfacial mass transfer mechanism is occurring within the SCR systems. This hypothesis is an alternative to the standard mechanism of gas transfer from the bubble into the liquid phase, and then into the biofilm. Understanding of interfacial transfer is likely to be important for developing the knowledge of SCR processes. Overall, both external and internal mass transfer phenomena have been demonstrated to create important rate limitations to suspended aggregate systems (flocs and granules) and biofilms grown in suspended carrier reactors. This significantly advances the conceptual understanding of these biological treatment processes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">770502 Land and water management</field><field name="subject">290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="subject">670000 - Manufacturing</field><field name="subject">mass transfer</field><field name="subject">biofilm</field><field name="subject">flocs</field><field name="subject">granules</field><field name="subject">activated sludge</field><field name="subject">oxygen</field><field name="subject">suspended carrier reactor</field><field name="subject">TOGA</field><field name="subject">off-gas analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157954</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Japanese Consumer Co-operatives - A Market Entry Opportunity for Queensland Fresh Horticultural Produce</field><field name="creator">Ada, Richard Laird</field><field name="description">It is important that Queensland horticultural producers develop export capacity. Production is increasing and Australia has a relatively small domestic market. Export also provides a means to diversify as a risk management strategy and to arrest the income decline from existing markets. This research provides Queensland horticultural producers with a practical example of how the principles of supply chain management and relationship marketing may be applied to successfully access a new export market &#150; the Japanese consumer co-operatives. The thesis examines the theories of relationship marketing and supply chain management and proposes that these constructs provide a suitable format for the development of trading relationships between Queensland producers and Japanese consumer co-operatives. Based on surveys of the co-operatives, the thesis outlines the specific philosophical and operational issues for the co-operatives which impact on their use of imported fruit and vegetables, and identifies direct supply from producers to consumers (sanchoku) as a potential strategy for gaining market entry. Key success factors are developed from the survey data and applied to a case study of a Queensland asparagus company and a mid-sized Japanese co-operative. The development of the business relationship and supply chain is chronicled for the case study firms. The dissertation concludes with observations from the case study and the co-operative survey, providing valuable insights into the strategies required by Queensland firms to build lasting relationships and profitable supply chains into Japanese consumer co-operatives.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Japan</field><field name="subject">consumer co-operatives</field><field name="subject">case study</field><field name="subject">relationship marketing</field><field name="subject">supply chain management</field><field name="subject">horticulture</field><field name="subject">international trade</field><field name="subject">market access</field><field name="subject">market entry strategy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157950</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of the Effects of Dairy Farmers' Personalities on Their Risk Attitudes, Decision Making Processes and Risk Management</field><field name="creator">Marchant, David Durack</field><field name="description">Abstract The aim of this study was to understand the relationships among the personality traits, risk attitudes, risk management practices, and decision making processes of dairy farmers in SE Queensland. Risk management and decision making processes are two of many components of managerial ability. The hypothesis was proposed that dairy farmers&#146; personalities influence their risk attitudes, decision making processes, and risk management abilities. Case studies of 46 dairy farmers in SE Queensland involving the completion of personality inventories (NEO-PI-R) based on the Five-Factor Model of personality; questionnaires and informal interviews were used to test the hypotheses. The thesis contains three parts. The first part, Chapter 1, is the introduction to the thesis. The second part of the thesis, Chapter 2 through Chapter 6, consists of an extensive review of the literature on the major topics pertinent to the project. In Chapter 2, a definition of &#147;competence&#148; in the context of this study is given, and an explanation of the evidence for a connection between personality and competence and thus job performance is detailed. In Chapter 3, the literature on personality is reviewed with particular emphasis on trait theory and the development of the Five-Factor Model of personality (FFM). In Chapter 4, the literature review on personality assessment using testing instruments designed for use in the context of the FFM is presented, and the rationale for the personality test instrument is expounded. It is the task of the manager to manage risk, so that considering risk attitude when making decisions is also an integral part of the study of the role of managers. Chapter 5 reviews the contemporary literature on risk and risk management with an emphasis on the application of risk management principles to dairy farms. In Chapter 6, the literature on decision theory is reviewed. Decision-making and risk management are intertwined. The behaviour resulting from the process of making a decision reflects the personality and risk attitude of the decision-maker. In this chapter, the distinction is made between formal and informal models of decision making, and examples are given. The third part of the project comprises Chapters 7 through Chapter 11. Chapter 7 outlines the research approach used &#150; case studies - and paves the way for the following two chapters, which present a qualitative and a quantitative analysis of the data from the case studies. Chapter 8 presents part 1 of the investigation - the qualitative analysis of the case studies. This chapter introduces and explains the terminology used in the questionnaire and examines the trends and feeling in the farmers&#146; answers. Chapter 9 presents part 2 of the analysis &#150; quantitative results of the personality assessments and interviews from the case studies with SE Queensland dairy farmers which were conducted to assess their risk management and decision making abilities. Chapter 10 provides a summary of the research findings, and then discusses the results with respect to the diverse responses of farmers to common external pressures. The chapter discusses the relevance of personality to the formation of management strategy and concludes with a short introduction to systems thinking as a way of thinking about the complex systems inherent in dairy farming. Chapter 11 reviews the subjects covered in the thesis and draws conclusions from the research. It outlines implications for policy makers and managers and proposes directions for further research in this area of investigation.

It is a multi-level intervention package that allows the strength and format of the intervention to be tailored to the needs of the family. Teen Triple P is available in three modalities: individual; group; and self-directed programs. This research investigated whether a self-directed program, Self-directed Teen Triple P, which consists of a parent workbook and video is sufficient to reduce risk factors known to be associated with the development of serious emotional and behavioural problems in adolescents and enhance protective factors. The present research sought to: a) determine the impact of a self-directed behavioural family intervention program on parents&#146; perceptions of their adolescent&#146;s behaviour; b) assess the efficacy and consumer acceptance of a self-directed parenting intervention; c) identify clinical implications arising from this research to assist practitioners in the appropriate use of self-directed behavioural family intervention programs; and d) examine the psychometric properties of treatment outcome measures for use with adolescents and their parents. A central tenet of this research is the principal of sufficiency that is, examining the ability of a behavioural family intervention to produce desirable outcomes for adolescents and their parents under lowest intervention and cost conditions. Fifty-one Queensland families with children in Year 7 or 8, aged 11-14 years, were recruited from the community by means of flyers distributed to schools, newspaper and radio advertisements. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: (1) Standard self-directed Teen Triple P, a 10 module workbook program supplemented by a video; (2) Enhanced Self-directed Teen Triple P, the same program as Standard self-directed Teen Triple P, but included 10, 15-minute weekly telephone consultations with a Triple P therapist to assist in tailoring the program to meet the individual family&#146;s needs; or (3) Waitlist control, a comparison group who initially only completed the measures, but later went on to do a replication of the standard intervention. The program was implemented with average recruitment (61%), and moderate attrition rate (23.5%). At post-intervention, using parent report measures of adolescent behaviour and parenting practices, parents in the enhanced condition reported significantly fewer adolescent behaviour problems and less use of dysfunctional parenting strategies than parents in the waitlist condition. Parents in the standard condition reported improvements in some areas but not as large or wide-spread as the enhanced group. Improvements were maintained at 3-month follow-up. There was no significant difference among conditions at post-intervention or follow-up on parents&#146; self-report measures of depression, anxiety, stress or relationship quality. The psychometric properties of measures of adolescent functioning, parenting style, relationship satisfaction and parental adjustment previously reported on different samples were confirmed. An underlying factor structure for the Parent Problem Checklist was identified and implications for its use discussed. Modifications to the scoring of the Consumer Satisfaction Questionnaire are discussed in the light of its factor structure. This research provides important information regarding the efficacy of a self-directed behavioural family intervention as an early intervention for families of early adolescents experiencing some problematic behaviour. It also provides some clinical implications of using self-directed interventions with families.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">behavioural family intervention</field><field name="subject">parenting</field><field name="subject">risk factors</field><field name="subject">protective factors</field><field name="subject">self-help</field><field name="subject">telephone consultations</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157948</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Dynamics of Chinese Consumer Behaviour in Relation to the Purchase of Imported Fruit</field><field name="creator">Sun, Ximing Sun</field><field name="description">The demand for imported fruit in China has increased dramatically since it first appeared in Chinese markets around 1993. Although imported fruit is much more expensive than domestically produced fruit and people&#146;s income is much lower in China than in developed countries, imported fruit still attracts many willing buyers. Conventional concepts such as meeting basic needs or increasing consumer awareness of the importance of fresh fruit to a healthy lifestyle cannot adequately explain this phenomenon, as there is an abundance of fresh, cheap, local produce available in almost every Chinese market. There must be other factors influencing buying behaviour. To explore these factors and to examine the dynamics of the market for imported fruit, this research adopted a mixed qualitative-quantitative methodology guided by the paradigm of phenomenology. The research examined the characteristics of imported fruit itself, criteria imposed by Chinese buyers on these characteristics, the intended uses of imported fruit and their associated consumption values. To shed light on the possible influence of socio-economic factors, the research also compared buyers from two Chinese cities, Guangzhou and Urumqi. The former is one of the most developed cities in China and the latter is regarded as among the more backward and conservative cities in China. The research identified ten attributes that appeal to Chinese buyers. Six relate to the fruit&#146;s physical attributes: that it has better appearance and packaging, lower chemical residues, better or different taste, and freshness. The remaining four relate to symbolic attributes associated with the fruit: that it represents achievement, wealth, personality and social status. Five intended uses of imported fruit were identified: for gifts, self-consumption, children, aged parents and patients. Four consumption values underlying these intentions were also identified: symbolism, concern for health, meeting basic needs and hedonism. However, the research revealed that no single combination of intended use and consumption value drives the demand for imported fruit in the Chinese market. Most frequently, it is a mix of hedonic and symbolic values behind a range of different intended uses that stimulates demand. Pursuing hedonic and symbolic values also leads to the visual quality of imported fruit generally being the most appealing attribute to Chinese buyers, a pattern common to both Guangzhou and Urumqi. These findings make a significant contribution to empirical knowledge about Chinese consumer behaviour. Results provide valuable insights into the interrelationships among product attributes, intended uses, consumption values and cultural values, and would give essential guidance to the development of strategies to market imported fruit in China. The research also examined limitations of current analytical approaches to the study of consumer behaviour. It demonstrated that approaches based on neural networks and fuzzy logic could be used independently or combined with conventional statistical methods to improve the explanation of consumer behaviour in this case. A comparison was carried out between the most popular form of neural networks (feedforward networks) and multivariate statistical methods in terms of their ability to predict behavioural intention through consumers&#146; attitudes towards products. Results demonstrated that neural networks were capable of capturing nonlinear aspects of complex relationships and producing better predictions than conventional statistical models. To explore consumer cognitive patterns, the research also compared K-means clustering with a Self-organizing Map (SOM) neural network in terms of the ability to cluster consumers on the basis of perceptions towards imported fruit attributes. Results indicate a superior outcome when K-means is used in conjunction with SOM in clustering analysis: using SOM to determine the &#145;natural&#146; numbers of clusters and using K-means to do clustering. Finally, to quantitatively evaluate the impact of consumption values, this research develops a new approach that combines Means-end Chain theory with fuzzy logic theory. Given the global importance of the Chinese market, the successful application of neural networks and fuzzy logic in this study of the behaviour of Chinese consumers purchasing imported fruit could have wider ramifications. If the approach were proven in other applications, it could significantly improve the ability to understand the demand for consumer goods in China.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese consumer behaviour</field><field name="subject">imported fruit</field><field name="subject">neural networks</field><field name="subject">fuzzy logic</field><field name="subject">Self-organizing map</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157947</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Epidemiology of Shiga Toxin-producing Escherichia coli in Australian Dairy Cattle</field><field name="creator">Cobbold, Rowland Neville</field><field name="description">Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) have important public health and food safety implications. Cattle are the primary reservoir for STEC, which are transmitted to humans via contact with cattle or related food products. Dairy farms in particular have been incriminated as an important source of STEC. The broad aim of this study was to examine in depth the epidemiology of STEC on the dairy farm. The presence of STEC on three Australian dairy farms was surveyed. This aimed to provide data on the prevalence and nature of STEC on Australian dairy farms, as well as to examine in more detail the pre-harvest/slaughter ecology of STEC. STEC, E. coli O157:H7 and E. coli O26:H11 prevalences were similar to those from dairy farms in other countries. Replacement heifers were the most important source of STEC on the farms. Calves excreted STEC from an early age, with faecal prevalence peaking at weaning. Higher STEC prevalence was also associated with group housing of calves during weaning. Calf isolates were potential human pathogens based on serotype and virulence markers. Clonal relationships between isolates were analysed. Calf isolates were diverse and had a high clonal turnover. STEC isolated from within the same farm had a higher genetic similarity than those from different farms. Vertical and horizontal transmission were both identified among cattle. The farm environment was also identified as an important source of STEC. Reasons for increased levels of STEC excretion by calves were investigated. Two broad hypotheses for higher faecal shedding were proposed and examined individually. The first was that an animal is more likely to excrete STEC when its exposure to STEC is greater, thus promoting inoculation of the gastrointestinal tract. Calves were experimentally inoculated with a traceable STEC strain to examine the infection dynamics of STEC within cattle groups, and explore the effect of calf management procedures. Calves which were housed in groups and co-jointly fed and managed had a higher prevalence of the inoculation strain than animals housed individually. The test strain was readily isolated from the hides and saliva of inoculated calves, as well as their immediate environments. Calves become infected with STEC via the faecal-oral route, iv either by direct contact with other calves, or indirectly through contact with faecally contaminated materials. The second hypothesis was that individual animals are variably susceptible to intestinal colonisation by STEC, which leads to differing magnitudes and durations of STEC carriage. Factors influencing colonisation susceptibility to STEC and the mechanisms behind these factors were also examined. In order to compare enteric colonisation under a range of different conditions, a suitable experimental system was developed. In vitro organ culture of explanted ruminant colonic tissues provided a laboratory model that was representative of in vivo bacterial-mucosal attachment. The degree of STEC colonisation was enumerated using an immunofluorescent filtration technique. The quantitative colonisation assay was applied to determine the effects of host-dependant variables on STEC colonisation. Colonic tissues from weaning calves and adult cattle did not differ significantly in their susceptibility to colonisation; nor did tissues from cattle fed either high forage or high grain diets. Colonic explants from sheep, however, demonstrated significantly higher numbers of adherent STEC than bovine explants. It was therefore concluded that while species-specific differences in host tissues may mediate STEC carriage differences, this did not explain in vivo variability in age and diet related excretion. Factors that indirectly affect the susceptibility of host tissues to colonisation were examined. E. coli O157:H7 cultured in media designed to represent the enteric contents of a well-fed ruminant colonised the colonic mucosa in reduced numbers, indicating that age and diet may be correlated with differences in STEC carriage and excretion because of differing physiological augmentation of the intra-enteric environment. In conclusion, while group dynamics and management practices may increase STEC shedding prevalences for cattle via increased STEC exposure, factors that modulate an individual ruminant&#146;s gastrointestinal carriage of STEC have a significant role in mediating STEC excretion. Either directly or indirectly, species, age and diet can affect the numbers of STEC that colonise the bowel wall, thereby influencing the magnitude and duration of STEC excretion. Both of these features of ruminant STEC ecology should be addressed in order to reduce the pre-slaughter/harvest presence of STEC.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">livestock</field><field name="subject">STEC</field><field name="subject">VTEC</field><field name="subject">EHEC</field><field name="subject">public health</field><field name="subject">food safety</field><field name="subject">zoonosis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157945</field></doc><doc><field name="title">INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE UTILITY OF REAL-TIME PCR FOR THE DETECTION, QUANTITATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF CLINICALLY RELEVANT VIRUSES.</field><field name="creator">MACKAY, IAN MAXWELL</field><field name="description">The use of PCR as a tool for the diagnostic virology and viral research laboratories has greatly increased in recent years, however the use of conventional PCR and amplicon detection systems can be a complex and relatively slow process that increases the risk of amplicon carry-over contamination. Many conventional PCR systems are unsuited for, or unable to perform as accurate diagnostic and quantitative tools because viruses are present in such a diverse variety of patient tissues and in a broad range of concentrations. Traditional viral culture, while still the gold standard for the detection of many viruses, is lengthy, expensive and often subjective. In addition, successful isolation of infectious virus is variable and dependent upon appropriate cell lines, lengthy incubations and careful transport and storage of clinical specimens. Many of the disadvantages arising from the use of traditional assays for the detection of viruses have been overcome by the development of real-time PCR. The technology has continued to develop due to the introduction of several commercial thermal cycling platforms and the appearance of numerous specific and non-specific fluorogenic chemistries. For the purpose of this thesis, human virology was sectioned into three diagnostic divisions containing the synthetic viruses, the well characterised viruses and the new or emerging viruses. This thesis proposes the hypothesis that real-time PCR could greatly improve upon traditional techniques for the detection, quantitation and characterisation of the members of these three divisions in both research and diagnostic environments. Conventional competitive quantitative PCR assays and a non-oligoprobe real-time PCR assay were constructed to detect novel synthetic gene therapy vectors developed from retroviruses. When compared to oligoprobe-based real-time PCR, it was clear that conventional molecular assays, whilst improving upon traditional methods of viral culture and immunofluorescence, were slower, more complex, less versatile and were hindered by a limited dynamic range. Synthetic control templates were developed and an improved method of assaying these template preparations was devised. The controls were used to precisely optimise each assay, create quality assurance reagents and to construct external standard curves permitting the absolute quantitation of viral templates. Real-time PCR achieved several significant goals during the studies performed for this thesis. The new assays detected human enterovirus (HEV) and the emerging pathogen, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) which were both responsible for seasonal outbreaks of serious disease that would otherwise have gone undiagnosed. These data led to the first description of hMPV outside of the Netherlands, as well as the first description of two validated rapid diagnostic RT-PCR assays which permitted the definitive classification of hMPV as a global pathogen of children and adults. Building upon its detection, an extensive molecular epidemiological study permitted the description of subtle differences between Australian and the more recently described international hMPV strains resulting in the classification of two distinct types of hMPV (A and B) and within these, four subtypes (A1, A2, B1 and B2). Real-time PCR rapidly detected, quantitated and genotyped herpes simplex viruses in a single reaction and determined the successful delivery of human and non-human genes by novel retroviral vectors in less time than any other phenotype detection assay. Additionally, these studies produced quantitative data which permitted the rapid calculation of transduction efficiency. Real-time PCR was able to quickly assess the efficiency of the PCR either in response to the titration of individual reaction components or as a result of amplification modifiers present within specimen extracts. The use of nucleotide sequencing studies ideally complemented earlier diagnostic studies of HEV and permitted the discrimination of pathogenic enterovirus 71. This thesis demonstrated that real-time PCR is more able to accommodate the demanding aspects of viral research and diagnostics than any other single method, and is now in a position to replace many of the traditional techniques still used by laboratories unfamiliar with the benefits of real-time PCR. The assays, techniques, reagents and publications resulting from these studies have benefited several areas of viral research and diagnostics and have improved the understanding of the role of real-time PCR in virology and of the technique in general, among the greater scientific community whilst successfully addressing the proposed hypothesis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">human metapneumovirus</field><field name="subject">virology</field><field name="subject">virus</field><field name="subject">real-time pcr</field><field name="subject">diagnostics</field><field name="subject">respiratory</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157946</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Looking for a Good Teacher : A Story of a Personal Journey</field><field name="creator">Lewis, Patrick John</field><field name="description">Humans make sense of experience through narrative and stories. ?Narratives are a primary embodiment of our understanding of the world, our experience, and ultimately ourselves? (Kerby, 1991, p. 3). Story enlarges our capacity to understand our actions and our values and lets us talk about them (Novak, 1978, p. 63). Story is a ?mode of thinking and feeling? that facilitates people?s ability to ?create a version of the world in which, psychologically, they can envisage a place for themselves?a personal world? (Bruner, 1996, p. 39). It is also vital to the realization of that world. This study is a storyteller-teacher-researcher?s personal quest to find a good teacher. The stories are my looking. I am telling a story of looking for a good teacher that implicitly demonstrates how narratives facilitate a deeper understanding of good teaching. I pursue the quest simultaneously in three realms that blend with, enrich, and enlarge each other: recovering from illness, journeying around the world, and reflecting on teaching practice. The stories in this work are showing the capacity of narrative imagining in human experience. Through the stories re-presented here, I made discoveries that are very important to being a good teacher. Yet those discoveries cast a shadow across something else that is necessary to being a good teacher and kept it hidden from my view. It was not until I had almost completed the storying process of telling, reflecting, and discovering that the shadow receded and that which is so integral to being a good teacher was revealed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Story</field><field name="subject">Teaching</field><field name="subject">Narrative</field><field name="subject">Reflective Practice</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157944</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Between Scylla and Charybdis: Navigating Amendment Law in the Australian Patent System</field><field name="creator">McBratney, Amanda Jane</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the historical development and current state of amendment law in the Australian patent system. Initial research on modern amendment cases immediately showed that the confused, inconsistent and complex state of the law is a significant problem. There is a plethora of different analytical tools and legal tests being applied to assess an amendment, yet they were developed in a different area of patent law, that of fair basing. Such tools and tests are ill equipped to provide any real assistance to decision-makers faced with assessing an amendment. In fact, they seem to lead decision-makers away from applying the correct investigation as set out in the amendment provisions of the legislation. The thesis examines the history of amendment law so as to place its discussion of the current problems in context and provide a better understanding of why the problems arose. Four major events are discussed in the thesis. Together, these events have shaped Australian amendment law over the past century: (i) the development and introduction of the &#147;substantially larger than or substantially different from&#148; test into the British and Australian statutory amendment provisions; (ii) the development and introduction of the concept of fair basing into British and Australian patent law; (iii) the development and introduction of the modern British and Australian statutory test for amendments and the tiered amendment scheme; and (iv) the analogies drawn in modern British and Australian cases between fair basing and amendment that ultimately led to fair basing tests being cross-applied in Australia to assess the allowability of amendments. The thesis shows how the very harsh early British treatment of requests for amendment ultimately led to statutory change. It also locates, for the first time, the common law origins of the notion of &#147;fair basing.&#148; The 1949 British legislation implemented a new and different statutory test that was intended to liberalise the whole area of amendment law. It also added the requirement of &#147;fair basing&#148; into the legislation. However, the thesis shows that this last development occurred via well-intentioned legislators with a significant misunderstanding of patent law. The notion of fair basing injected a great deal of uncertainty into an area of law that was previously settled. Theoretically, and in practical application, it caused problems. Then, when decision-makers sought guidance on the new amendment provision, they applied the tests developed in fair basing cases to assess amendments, with the consequent deleterious effects. The Australian experience largely mirrored the British experience until 1977 when the British Act changed. The significance of the thesis is that it clearly demonstrates that the currently accepted dogma &#150; that fair basing is equivalent to the &#147;in substance disclosure&#148; statutory test for amendments, so fair basing tests can be used to assess amendment &#150; is unsound. The thesis isolates the problems inherent in the dogma and the examination of relevant case law confirms the main hypothesis that the current approach should be rejected. It simply operates to the prejudice of inventors, their competitors, the public and the patent system itself. Most importantly, the thesis shows that reform is urgently needed. Some possibilities for reform are suggested.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">patent law</field><field name="subject">amendment</field><field name="subject">fair basing</field><field name="subject">fair basis</field><field name="subject">disconformity</field><field name="subject">undue claim width</field><field name="subject">s102 Patents Act 1990</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157942</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE INTERACTIONS OF LYNGBYA MAJUSCULA BLOOM, THE ANTHROPOGENIC INPUTS AND THE ASSOCIATED MEIOFAUNA IN MORETON BAY, QUEENSLAND.</field><field name="creator">Garcia-Novoa, Rosa</field><field name="description">Coastal ecosystems continue to come under increasing pressure from human activities and the input of anthropogenic substances. This is being realised in a number of areas where eutrophic conditions begin to dominate and phenomena such as toxic algal blooms increase in frequency. Amidst this situation there is a growing need to understand how ecosystem components such as benthic fauna might respond to these conditions and how we might better use some of these components as indicators of ecosystem perturbation. In this context the current study examines the distribution and abundance of sediment meiofauna in seagrass beds at two different locations in Moreton Bay estuary. This ecosystem presently receives significant anthropogenic inputs from the Brisbane River and other sources draining the greater Brisbane catchment and adjoining areas. The main aims of the study were to characterise the distribution and abundance of meiofauna in these sediments and to also examine some of the main factors influencing these features. Also, it was intended that on examination be made of the influence that blooms of the cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula might have on meiofauna abundance and distribution in these areas. Blooms of this alga are an increasing feature of the Moreton Bay estuary and potentially represent a strong influence on a range of habitats and organisms within the ecosystem. In considering the physico-chemical aspects influencing meiofauna, sediment grain size and nutrient levels were shown to have some effect on distribution and abundance although this varied between species and location. Further, the grain size of the sediment and the total organic carbon did not change significantly between bloom and non-bloom periods and but total nitrogen and C/N ratio did show a change. In regard to the observed effects of the L. majuscula blooms, a negative impact was observed on copepod and nematode abundance and distribution. In both cases their abundance was considerably smaller during the bloom period. Notably, polychaetes showed no effect from the bloom?s occurrence. The results also indicate that during the bloom the meiofauna were distributing shallower in the sediment, probably due to the hypoxic conditions that the bloom may have created. Moreover, the impact of the bloom was more pronounced in the smaller size classes for the meiofauna and suggests that these classes are more sensitive to the conditions generated by the deposited bloom material. Under Multiple Regression Analysis nematodes and polychaetes were positively correlated with sediment nitrogen concentration, while copepods were not. Also, during the bloom the nitrogen concentration in the sediment increased but the abundance of nematodes showed an opposite trend. The general negative effect of the bloom on the total fauna might be the responsible for this result. An attempt was also made to assess whether the nematode:copepod ratio (Ne:Co) could be used in this ecosystem as an indicator of pollutant input or habitat disturbance by the algal bloom. This ratio has been used elsewhere with some success. Results from this study indicated that this ratio has only limited value as an indicator in the study situation and that the concomitant influence of sediment grain size and nutrient levels lead to a potentially misleading interpretation of the results that the ratio provides. The interactions between meiofauna, the prevailing physico-chemical and biological characteristics of the sediments in Moreton Bay are clearly very complex. The influence of phenomena such as the Lyngbya blooms adds to this complexity but, in the current study, this was seen to clearly have an effect on both animal abundance and their distribution. In this regard, the present study has identified the key areas of influence from the algal blooms and has also highlighted the need to further research these important animal groups so that we may better understand how the benthos, and thus the wider ecosystem, might cope with pollutants and anthropogenic disturbances.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lyngby majuscula</field><field name="subject">Meiofauna</field><field name="subject">Nutrients</field><field name="subject">Moreton Bay</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157941</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling HTR separation</field><field name="creator">Ziemski, Marcin</field><field name="description">An introduction to titanium minerals is provided along with a brief history of high tension roll (HTR) separation and its applications. Current HTR theory is critically reviewed and deficiencies in previous modelling work are identified. These problems are recognised as the likely reason why past models required empirical manipulation to reproduce observed separation behaviour. An updated theory of charge decay in a particle bed is developed for HTR applications. Particle bed interactions and their effects on electrostatic forces and discharge rates are examined, leading to a reviewed analysis of force balance. The theoretical contributions are incorporated into a new HTR model which takes a mechanistic approach to describing machine operation, as opposed to previous empirical-based work in the area. A simplified electrostatic field model is also developed. Atmospheric effects on separation behaviour are ignored in the modelling. Experimental separations are used to validate new model performance, where comparisons are specifically designed to test the theoretical developments on charge decay and force balance in a particle bed. The new model is also compared to the Dance (1992) HTR model, embedded in JKSimSand, the most recent HTR model with an empirical basis. An error analysis shows the new model performs as well as, or better, than JKSimSand in most respects. The fact that this is achieved with a mechanistic approach validates the new developments in particle bed charge decay and force theory, and sets the foundation for mechanistic HTR simulation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HTR</field><field name="subject">Titanium</field><field name="subject">Ilmenite</field><field name="subject">Rutile</field><field name="subject">High tension separation</field><field name="subject">High tension roll</field><field name="subject">Electrostatic separation</field><field name="subject">Electrical properties</field><field name="subject">Zircon</field><field name="subject">Modelling</field><field name="subject">Simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157939</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teleonomic Creativity: An Analysis of Causality</field><field name="creator">Pudmenzky, Alex</field><field name="description">When the human mind searches concept space for solutions to a given condition we have a choice between conventional and creative thinking. But what are the probabilities of improving a given situation using creative thinking compared with conventional thinking? To answer this question we are extending the meaning of creativity beyond human creativity. We view creativity as an optimised search strategy applicable to the larger set of all teleonomic systems and term this creativity teleonomic creativity. We argue that an analog process is common to all manifestations of creativity within teleonomic systems and describe this process and its cause. In order to show this process and to make quantitative comparisons, we utilise the metaphor of an adaptive fitness landscape and simple statistical techniques. The term fitness in our case describes the condition of a well-defined property being suitable for a purpose, rather than an overall evaluation of many complex interactions measuring reproductive success. We define creativity as the successful attempt of either individuals or populations to gain higher fitness via exploration of global fitness peaks as opposed to the exploitation of a currently occupied local peak. We then show mathematically how the inclusion of creativity in a search can dramatically increase the chances of finding appropriate solutions. We also recognise that creative behaviour is most successful when the environmentis unstable. We note the existence of a strategic meta-parameter that allows self-adaptation when tuned via a feedback loop from the environment. We show that creativity can be understood as a random process with an optimal setting for the standard deviation that maximises the probability of hitting a target of higher fitness. We support our claims with computer simulations and observe several occurrences of teleonomic creativity in nature. In addition we measure the entropy of a teleonomic system via the phase-space of internal variables and observe a sudden entropy increase during the onset of creative behaviour in a teleonomic system. Our investigations also enable us to rationalise the processes, conditions and phenomena surrounding human creativity such as mistakes, madness, serendipity, humor, analogy making and interpret the function of creativity promoters and inhibitors. Our findings may also allow us to incorporate creativity into artificial computer models. We speculate that creativity is an emerging property of any teleonomic system and as such ubiquitous in nature.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">creativity</field><field name="subject">telenomic system</field><field name="subject">meta-creativity</field><field name="subject">teleonomic creativity</field><field name="subject">fitness landscape</field><field name="subject">search optimisation</field><field name="subject">self-adaptation</field><field name="subject">random process</field><field name="subject">entrophy</field><field name="subject">serendipity</field><field name="subject">dissipative system</field><field name="subject">artificial creativity</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157938</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discovery of novel downstream target genes regulated by the hedgehog pathway</field><field name="creator">Ingram, Wendy Jill</field><field name="description">Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a secreted morphogen involved in patterning a wide range of structures in the developing embryo. When cells receive the Shh signal a cascade of effects begin which in turn regulate downstream target genes. The genes controlled by Sonic hedgehog provide messages instructing cells how to differentiate or when to divide. Disruption of the hedgehog signalling cascade leads to a number of developmental disorders and plays a key role in the formation of a range of human cancers. Patched, the receptor for Shh, acts as a tumour suppressor and is mutated in naevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS). NBCCS patients display a susceptibility to tumour formation, particularly for basal cell carcinoma (BCC). The discovery of Patched mutations in sporadic BCCs and other tumour types further highlights the importance of this pathway to human cancer. The identification of genes regulated by hedgehog is crucial for understanding how disruption of this pathway leads to neoplastic transformation. It is assumed that the abnormal expression of such genes plays a large role in directing cells to divide at inappropriate times. Only a small number of genes controlled by Shh have been described in vertebrate tissues. In the work presented in this thesis a Sonic hedgehog responsive embryonic mouse cell line, C3H/10T1/2, was used as a model system for hedgehog target gene discovery. Known downstream target genes were profiled to determine their induction kinetics, building up a body of knowledge on the response to Shh for this cell type. During this work, it was discovered that C3H/10T1/2 cells do not become fully competent to respond to Shh stimulation until the cells reach a critical density, a factor that had to be taken into account when determining timepoints of interest for further investigation. Several techniques were employed to identify genes that show expression changes between Shh stimulated and control cells. In one of these techniques, RNA from cell cultures activated with Shh was used to interrogate cDNA microarrays, and this provided many insights into the downstream transcriptional consequences of hedgehog stimulation. Microarrays consist of thousands of spots of DNA of known sequence gridded onto glass slides. Experiments using this technology allow the expression level of thousands of genes to be measured simultaneously. Independent stimulation methods combined with northern blotting were used to investigate individual genes of interest, allowing genuine targets to be confirmed and false positives eliminated. This resulted in the identification of eleven target genes. Seven of these are induced by Sonic hedgehog (Thrombomodulin (Thbd), Glucocorticoid induced leucine zipper (Gilz), Brain factor 2 (Bf2), Nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 1 (Nr4a1), Insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2), Peripheral myelin protein 22 (Pmp22), Lim and SH3 Protein 1 (Lasp1)), and four are repressed (Secreted frizzled related proteins 1 and 2 (Sfrp1 and Sfrp2), Macrophage inflammatory protein-1 gamma (Mip-1?), and Anti-mullerian hormone (Amh)). The majority of these represent novel downstream genes not previously reported as targets of Shh. The new target genes have a diverse range of functions, and include transcriptional regulators and molecules known to be involved in regulating cell growth or apoptosis. The corroboration of genes previously implicated in hedgehog signalling, along with the finding of novel targets, demonstrates both the validity and power of the C3H/10T1/2 system for Shh target gene discovery. The identification of novel Sonic hedgehog responsive genes provides candidates whose abnormal expression may be decisive in initiating tumour formation and future studies will investigate their role in development and disease. It is expected that such findings will provide vital clues to the aetiology of various human cancers, and that an understanding of their roles may ultimately provide greater opportunities in the future design of anti-tumour therapies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cancer</field><field name="subject">hedgehog</field><field name="subject">patched</field><field name="subject">sonic hedgehog</field><field name="subject">C3H/10T1/2</field><field name="subject">10T1/2</field><field name="subject">basal cell carcinoma</field><field name="subject">BCC</field><field name="subject">microarray</field><field name="subject">microarrays</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157937</field></doc><doc><field name="title">INNER GEOMETRIC STRUCTURES OF GAUGE FIELDS AND TOPOLOGICAL EXCITATIONS</field><field name="creator">Liu, Xin</field><field name="description">The Thesis studies the inner geometric structures of gauge fields and topological excitations in a variety of physical systems. It is pointed out that a gauge potential can be decomposed in terms of a basic field of the physical system, i.e., a section field of the associated bundle on the manifold. The gauge theory delivered by the gauge potential can be reformulated by the basic field. As topological characteristic classes are constructed with gauge field tensors, substitution of the decomposition expression will yield an inner structure for a characteristic class in terms of the basic field. It has been found that the inner structure usually appears in the form of the so-called topological currents, from which different dimensional topological excitations can be derived. Topological charges, location and motion of excitations can be determined. Branching processes of excitations with topological charge conservation can be investigated. Significance of outcomes lies in that the topology of a manifold is directly linked to the intuitive geometric configuration of an associated section field distributed thereon. The main results are as follows. Firstly, typical decomposition results of gauge potentials are presented in Chapter 3. The SU(N) potential is decomposed in terms of the Cartan subalgebraic local bases. The result is compared with those obtained by Faddeev, Niemi and Cho. The SO(N) potential is decomposed respectively in terms of the Clifford 2- and 1- vectorial local bases, where attention has been paid to the difference between the N-even and -odd cases. A gauge potential can be decomposed in terms of different basic fields, for different purposes or in different situations, with the results demonstrating different properties of the system. The SU(2) and SO(4) gauge potentials are decomposed again, respectively in terms of the Pauli 2-spinor and Dirac 4-spinor. The former gives the spinor structures for the SU(2) Chern-Simons form and Chern density. The latter leads to the SpinC (4) potential decomposition. Comparing the SU(2) and SpinC (4) potentials, a characterizing equation for the U(l) twisting potential is discovered. This equation establishes a direct link between the spectral theory of the Laplacian operator and the determination of the U(l) twisting potential. Secondly, the results of gauge potential decomposition are applied in Chapter 4 in the study of topological currents and induced excitations. Emphasis is placed on characteristic classes and their corresponding topological currents. In the U(l) quantum mechanics, vortex lines arise from the first Chern class which appears as a 2-dimensional topological current. In the SU(2) spinor BEC, velocity-field and Mermin-Ho vortex lines and monopoles stem from the first Chern class of the U(l) sub-field in SU(2). It is shown that a physical system permits the existence of various excitations. Different topological currents and excitations even could be derived from the same original differential form, if different basic fields are chosen. Excitations in quantum Hall fluid are also discussed. The (N -I)-types of skyrmions in a two-dimensional SU(N) quantum Hall system are obtained. They stem from the (N - 1) U(l) sub-fields in SU(N). Instantons and anti-instantons in higher dimensional SO(4) quantum Hall fluid are studied. They arise from the second Chern class which appears as a 4-dimensional topological scalar current. The techniques of gauge potential decomposition and topological currents are combined in the study of the Chern-Simons knots. It is shown that the second order expansion of the Chern-Simons action can be expressed by the topological (self- )linking numbers of a knots family. This second order expansion is preserved during evolution-branching of knots.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158763</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cognition driven deformation modelling</field><field name="creator">Janke, Andrew Lindsay</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the development of a model of cerebral atrophic change associated with neurodegeneration.

Importantly, this also includes the investigation of the relationship between atrophic change and cognitive function. In unison with the growth in neuroimaging technology, myriad methodologies have been developed since the first quantitative measures of atrophic change were deduced via manual tracing. Subsequently, automated region of interest analysis, segmentation, voxel-based morphometry and non-linear registration have all been used to investigate atrophy. These methods commonly report findings of ventricular enlargement and temporal lobe change in AD and other dementias. Whilst these results are accurate indicators of atrophy, they are largely non-specific in their diagnostic utility. In addition, the aforementioned methods have been employed to discern change observed at discrete intervals during a disease process. In order to gain a greater understanding of the temporal characteristics of changes that occur as a result of atrophy, a deformation modelling method that allows the continuous tracking of these changes in a cohort of AD patients and elderly control subjects is presented in this thesis. Deformation modelling involves non-linear registration of images to investigate the change that is apparent between two or more images. The non- linear registration results are analysed and presented via three metrics: local volume loss (atrophy); volume (CSF) increase; and translation (interpreted as representing collapse of cortical structures). Changes observed in the analyses in this thesis are consistent with results from neuro-anatomical studies of AD. Results using the more traditional methods of analysis are presented for comparative purposes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280406 Mathematical Software</field><field name="subject">700101 Application packages</field><field name="subject">MRI</field><field name="subject">Alzheimers</field><field name="subject">Non-Linear Registration</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157936</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of Hormonal Treatments, Appraisal, and Coping on Cognitive and Psychosocial Functioning of Men With Non-Localised Prostate Cancer</field><field name="creator">Green, Heather Joy</field><field name="description">In chronic illnesses, such as prostate cancer, multiple health outcomes need to be considered. This project focused on two types of health outcomes: health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and cognitive function. The first aim was to investigate cognitive effects of pharmacological androgen-suppressing treatment. Numerous studies have shown cognitive performance to be associated with sex hormones. One of the main groups of drugs used for hormonal ablation in men with prostate cancer, the luteinising hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists, has been associated with adverse cognitive effects in controlled studies in women and in case reports of female and male patients. However, there have been no published studies on the effect of LHRH agonists and other androgen-suppressing treatments on cognitive functioning in male patients. The second aim was to investigate the effect of treatments on HRQoL in men with prostate cancer. There are few randomised treatment studies of HRQoL in these patients. The third aim was to study additional predictors of HRQoL, examining stress and coping theory as a theoretical basis for understanding individual differences in HRQoL. The fourth aim was to examine patients&#146; subjective experiences of prostate cancer. To investigate these questions, 82 men with non-localised prostate cancer were randomly assigned to receive leuprorelin (LHRH agonist), goserelin (LHRH agonist), cyproterone (steroidal antiandrogen), or close clinical monitoring. These patients and 20 community volunteers matched for age, marital status, and general health undertook medical, psychosocial, and cognitive assessments before treatment and after 6 and 12 months of treatment. The main question for statistical analysis was whether dependent variables would show Group x Time interactions in the predicted directions. Compared with baseline assessments, men administered androgen suppression monotherapy performed worse in 3/12 tests of attention, memory, and executive function. Twenty-six percent of men randomised to active treatment demonstrated clinically significant decline in one or more cognitive tests at 6 months compared with baseline performance. By contrast, no community volunteers or patients randomised to close monitoring showed decline in test performance. Men on hormonal treatments reported impaired sexual function on treatment compared with baseline assessments. Men assigned to close monitoring and cyproterone treatment reported increased emotional distress over time. Groups did not differ in change in existential satisfaction, subjective cognitive function, physical symptoms, or social and role functioning. For individuals, hormonal treatments were more frequently associated with decreased physical, sexual, social and role functioning, but were also associated with improved HRQoL for some individuals. In hierarchical regression analysis, HRQoL was lower for men who had more comorbid illnesses, a history of neurological dysfunction, higher threat appraisals, or higher use of emotion-focused coping strategies. Coping strategies also showed some longitudinal associations with HRQoL, even when earlier levels of HRQoL had been taken into account. Subjective reports demonstrated that many patients viewed prostate cancer as a relatively manageable problem. Several patients said that other health problems affected them more than prostate cancer, whereas no patient said that prostate cancer was worse than other problems. Comments about the seriousness of prostate cancer were equally divided between patients who reported it as very serious (14.3% of patients) and those who saw it as a relatively minor problem (14.3%). Other patient observations were grouped into categories of personal responses to prostate cancer, health, and health research; life circumstances that were not directly associated with health; attributions about medication; and function prior to the study. The results demonstrated that pharmacological androgen suppression therapy was associated with impaired memory, attention, and executive function in male patients. Hormonal treatments and close monitoring had differential effects on patients&#146; HRQoL, particularly in terms of sexual function and emotional distress. HRQoL was also associated with appraisal and coping, to a greater extent than it was associated with medical variables, supporting the applicability of stress and coping theory for these patients. Observations from participants placed these findings in the context of participants&#146; concerns, demonstrating that issues such as cognitive and sexual function were relevant for these patients. These findings suggest that cognitive function should be given increased attention as a health outcome, not only in &#147;neurological&#148; disorders but also in other &#147;non-neurological&#148; conditions such as prostate cancer. They also support continued efforts to understand both beneficial and adverse effects of treatments for chronic illness on HRQoL and individual factors that affect health outcomes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cancer</field><field name="subject">prostate</field><field name="subject">testosterone</field><field name="subject">cognition</field><field name="subject">coping</field><field name="subject">quality of life</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157934</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Practical approaches to improve the value of the Falkland Islands' sheep and wool industry</field><field name="creator">Miller, Sean Michael</field><field name="description">Studies were conducted to determine basic aspects of intake and digestion of native pastures by young sheep in the Falkland Islands, and to evaluate practical methods to improve the productivity of these animals. The studies were conducted in support of Industry and Government initiatives to reinvigorate Falklands&#146; agriculture. The current industry is based on broad diameter wools harvested from sheep grazing poor quality native pastures, and sheep suffer low growth rates, poor productivity and high mortality, and farmers rely on small flocks to produce a single commodity for their total income. The dramatic collapse of wool markets in the 1980&#146;s crippled the Falklands&#146; wool industry and farmers have relied heavily on subsidies for more than 12 years. The studies in this thesis were initiated to support the efforts to reinvigorate Falklands&#146; agriculture, and they examined basic aspects of the nutrition provided to sheep by native pastures and evaluated practical methods to improve the survival of sheep, their subsequent rate of growth and productive value to the economy. Five studies examined specific hypotheses posed at the outset of the research programme and they were broadly supported by the data presented in the thesis: &#183; A wether trial was used to benchmark the productivity of wool sheep in the Islands, and the trial demonstrated that substantial genetic variation exists within the national flock that may be exploited in the future to improve the productivity of the wool industry, &#183; Microhistological techniques were used in conjunction with n-alkane marker technology to investigate the diets consumed by sheep grazing native pastures. The diet studies concluded that the low quality of native pasture in the Falklands during autumn, winter and spring restricts growth and productivity of young sheep, &#183; Studies with weaner sheep treated with controlled release anthelmintics established that infection with gastrointestinal nematodes exacerbates poor nutrition of young sheep consuming native pastures, &#183; A short-term metabolism study demonstrated that native pasture hay fortified with molasses and urea, or winter forage crops may be used as supplements to enhance sheep productivity, and &#183; Forage crops were grown and evaluated under Falklands&#146; conditions, and when lambs were fed the resulting highly productive and nutritious forages, the study demonstrated that lamb growth can be increased significantly, and lamb carcasses offer local farmers the potential to diversify farm income by using existing Falklands&#146;-bred lambs to develop an export meat industry The data presented in this thesis demonstrate that the potential to improve the productive and financial position of Falklands&#146; farmers is substantial. If both the local Industry and Government maintain their joint commitment to industry-restructure, pastoral development and enterprise diversification, the Falklands&#146; agricultural economy stands to benefit considerably by adopting low risk solutions to address widespread problems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">630102 Sheep-wool</field><field name="subject">native pasture</field><field name="subject">alkanes</field><field name="subject">wool quality</field><field name="subject">sheep diets</field><field name="subject">gastrointestinal parasitism</field><field name="subject">urea-molasses treatment</field><field name="subject">brassicas</field><field name="subject">carcass quality</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157933</field></doc><doc><field name="title">IMPROVING THE CELLULAR ECONOMY OF STREPTOCOCCUS ZOOEPIDEMICUS THROUGH METABOLIC ENGINEERING</field><field name="creator">Fong Chong, Barrie</field><field name="description">Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a high molecular weight polysaccharide that is mainly produced by animals and certain bacteria. This polymer is biocompatible and possesses desirable rheological properties that are accentuated by high molecular weight. Diverse therapeutic applications have developed which harness these features. Pharmaceutical grade HA is mostly extracted from animal tissue. The HA derived from this source is suitable for most pharmaceutical preparations but there is growing pressure to avoid animal tissue products. This has provided the incentive to expand microbial-based HA manufacturing. However, the inherent low molecular weight of the polymer derived via this route has hampered widespread acceptance of microbial HA. This thesis examined the ramifications of improving the cellular economy of the HA-producing, gram-positive bacterium, Streptococcus zooepidemicus. Improved cellular economy is believed to be a prerequisite for achieving superior HA yields and molecular weights in this microorganism. This work examined the metabolic variation that accompanied the shift to more efficient modes of carbon utilization. In particular the effect of different sugar sources, uncoupling growth and polymer formation, and changes to the cellular oxidoreduction capacity were studied in more detail. This study utilized different sugar sources to enhance the recovery of energy. Fermenting glucose, fructose and maltose produced contrasting patterns of growth and HA formation. Culturing the organism in maltose caused a shift towards energy-efficient heterofermentative metabolism. Maltose-cultured cells displayed a biphasic pattern of metabolism. The first stage corresponded to a growth phase in which biomass synthesis profited from the increased energy yield. The second stage corresponded to an arginine-deficient stationary phase where the majority of the HA was formed. The fermentation rate was slower during stationary phase but continued to support HA biosynthesis. This bisphasic metabolism proved to be beneficial. A protracted stationary phase led to higher molecular weight HA. Fructose was unable to sustain a comparable polymer yield or molecular weight as glucose or maltose. There was evidence that the arginine deiminase pathway was responsible for the premature depletion of arginine in maltose-fermenting cultures. The accumulation of biomass exhibited a concentration-dependent response to the amount of glutamine in the medium. A second arginine transporter possessing a low affinity for glutamine could explain this phenomenon. Arginine consumption was slower when the glutamine level was elevated. This may indicate competition for a common transmembrane carrier. An elevated energetic yield and ATP formation rate were features of aerobic maltose metabolism. The relative improvement in biomass and HA yields were substantially greater for cultures fermenting maltose compared to glucose. However, no improvement in molecular weight compared to glucose was observed. A major factor contributing to the success of aerobic maltose fermentation was the particularly high NADH oxidase flux. This enzyme reoxidizes reduction equivalents in a reaction that is physically decoupled from the production of reduced metabolic products. Less lactate and ethanol accumulated in the presence of high NADH oxidase levels but acetate production was stimulated leading to an improved energetic yield. This result prompted an investigation into the effect of elevating the NADH oxidase level. The native NADH oxidase gene was sequenced and cloned into an inducible expression plasmid and introduced into S. zooepidemicus. Overproduction of this enzyme led to the desired improvement in ATP yield. A significant improvement in biomass yield was demonstrated. HA yield and molecular weight were not affected. Lactate and acetate were the main fermentation products. At high induction levels the quantity of lactate and acetate approached limiting levels and pyruvate overflow was more pronounced. This was attributed to insufficient flux capacity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme complex. The application of metabolic engineering to S. zooepidemicus has provided some insight into the regulation of energy metabolism in this microorganism and its relationship to HA synthesis. This study has observed that the specific rate of HA synthesis is correlated to the sugar uptake rate but is unaffected by the ATP yield. Under present conditions the formation of HA is not limited by the availability of energy. Nonetheless, microbial HA production will benefit from maximizing energetic yield. It was demonstrated that less catabolic carbon was expended to support biomass formation if the energetic yield was high. Therefore more residual carbon was available for HA synthesis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">metabolic flux analysis</field><field name="subject">energy metabolism</field><field name="subject">carbon source</field><field name="subject">amino acid catabolism</field><field name="subject">NADH oxidase</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157932</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Measurement of Task Complexity and Cognitive Ability: Relational Complexity in Adult Reasoning</field><field name="creator">Birney, Damian Patrick</field><field name="description">The theory of relational complexity (RC) developed by Halford and his associates (Halford et al., 1998a) proposes that, in addition to the number of unique entities that can be processed in parallel, it is the structure (complexity) of the relations between these entities that most appropriately captures the essence of processing capacity limitations. Halford et al. propose that the relational complexity metric forms an ordinal scale along which both task complexity and an individual&#146;s processing capacity can be ranked. However, the underlying quantitative structure of the RC metric is largely unknown. It is argued that an assessment of the measurement properties of the RC metric is necessary to first demonstrate that the scale is able to rank order task complexity and cognitive capacity in adults. If in addition to ordinal ranking, it can be demonstrated that a continuous monotonic scale underlies the ranking of capacity (the natural extension of the complexity classification), then the potential to improve our understanding of adult cognition is further realised. Using a combination of cognitive psychology and individual differences methodologies, this thesis explores the psychometric properties of RC in three high level reasoning tasks. The Knight-Knave Task and the Sentence Comprehension Task come from the psychological literature. The third task, the Latin Square Task, was developed especially for this project to test the RC theory. An extensive RC analysis of the Knight-Knave Task is conducted using the Method for Analysis of Relational Complexity (MARC). Processing in the Knight-Knave Task has been previously explored using deduction-rules and mental models. We have taken this work as the basis for applying MARC and attempted to model the substantial demands these problems make on limited working memory resources in terms of their relational structure. The RC of the Sentence Comprehension Task has been reported in the literature and we further review and extend the empirically evidence for this task. The primary criterion imposed for developing the Latin Square Task was to minimize confounds that might weaken the identification and interpretation of a RC effect. Factors such as storage load and prior experience were minimized by specifying that the task should be novel, have a small number of general rules that could be mastered quickly by people of differing ages and abilities, and have no rules that are complexity level specific. The strength of MARC lies in using RC to explicitly link the cognitive demand of a task with the capacity of the individual. The cognitive psychology approach predicts performance decrements with increased task complexity and primarily deals with aggregated data across task condition (comparison of means). It is argued however that to minimise the subtle circularity created by validating a task&#146;s complexity using the same information that is used to validate the individual&#146;s processing capacity, an integration of the individual differences approach is necessary. The first major empirical study of the project evaluates the utility of the traditional dual-task approach to analyse the influence of the RC manipulation on the dual-task deficit. The Easy-to-Hard paradigm, a modification of the dual-task methodology, is used to explore the influence of individual differences in processing capacity as a function of RC. The second major empirical study explores the psychometric approach to cognitive complexity. The basic premise is that if RC is a manipulation of cognitive complexity in the traditional psychometric sense, then it should display similar psychometric properties. That is, increasing RC should result in an increasing monotonic relationship between task performance and Fluid Intelligence (Gf) &#150; the complexity-Gf effect. Results from the comparison of means approach indicates that as expected, mean accuracy and response times differed reliably as a function of RC. An interaction between RC and Gf on task performance was also observed. The pattern of correlations was generally not consistent across RC tasks and is qualitatively different in important ways to the complexity-Gf effect. It is concluded that the Latin Square Task has sufficient measurement properties to allows us to discuss (i) how RC differs from complexity in tasks in which expected patterns of correlations are observed, (ii) what additional information needs to be considered to assist with the a priori identification of task characteristics that impose high cognitive demand, and (iii) the implications for understanding reasoning in dynamic and unconstrained environments outside the laboratory. We conclude that relational complexity theory provides a strong foundation from which to explore the influence of individual differences in performance further.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380199 Psychology not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">780108 Behavioural and cognitive sciences</field><field name="subject">intelligence</field><field name="subject">relational complexity</field><field name="subject">cogntive complexity</field><field name="subject">reasoning</field><field name="subject">latin square</field><field name="subject">processing limitations</field><field name="subject">comprehension</field><field name="subject">cognitive psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157930</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A regional Investigation of the Thermal and Fluid Flow History of the Drummond Basin, Central Queensland, Australia.</field><field name="creator">Morrison, Christopher Stedman</field><field name="description">Abstract The Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous Drummond Basin of central Queensland, Australia is one of the oldest units of the New England Fold Belt. Samples of authigenic clay minerals have been collected from across the Drummond Basin and analysed using mineralogic, isotopic and geochronologic techniques. X-Ray diffraction analysis on 36 samples selected from six exploration wells was carried out on volcaniclastic and argillaceous sandstones and mudstones of the Drummond Basin sequence in order to ascertain authigenic illite content. Sixteen samples were found to be suitable for K-Ar dating purposes, containing abundant illite and illite/smectite mixed layers (I/S). K-Ar age dating was carried out on these selected samples yielding three age groups at 300, 250 and 200 Ma. Temperature of formation was estimated for the authigenic illite and illite/smectite minerals, based on illite crystallinity and illite content of illite/smectite mixed layers. Two groups of temperatures have been delineated, with a high temperature assemblage of between 275&#168;&#172;C-320&#168;&#172;C and a low temperature assemblage of approximately 100&#168;&#172;C. When compared with the age groups, it is seen that the older event was typically hotter. Stable isotope compositions for the authigenic clay minerals were analysed with &#165;&#228;D and &#165;&#228;18O values of between -68&#162;&#182; to -117&#162;&#182; and +7.5&#162;&#182; to +14.4&#162;&#182; (SMOW) respectively. Isotopic compositions for the fluid in equilibrium with the clay minerals were calculated using palaeotemperatures estimated from the clay mineralogy and range between -90&#162;&#182; and -41&#162;&#182; and -0.6&#162;&#182; and +8.7&#162;&#182; (SMOW) for hydrogen and oxygen respectively. These compositions are more depleted in deuterium and more enriched in 18O than those previously reported for basins in the region. The data also produced three groups of fluid compositions, which correlate with the age distributions delineated by the K-Ar geochronology. The first fluid composition, which correlated with the Permo-Carboniferous age (~300 Ma) is interpreted to result from a mixing of Permo-Carboniferous meteoric water with highly evolved formation water trapped within the Drummond Basin since deposition of the basin. The regional extensional event at the Permo-Carboniferous boundary, which initiated the opening of the Bowen Basin to the east of the Drummond Basin allowed meteoric water to percolate deep into the basin, enabling the growth of illite rich clay minerals at this time. The second fluid group is considered to represent the evolution of Late Triassic meteoric water migrating through the Drummond Basin during another extensional period in the region at approximately 200 Ma. This event precipitated a new period of clay mineral growth in the basin (reflected in the K-Ar dates), raised the geothermal gradient in the region and extended the crust, forming new sedimentary basins within the New England Fold Belt. The third assemblage of fluid compositions were found to be very similar to the Late Triassic group, with &#165;&#228;D and &#165;&#228;18O values plotting very close to the Late Triassic meteoric water evolution trend. This is interpreted as representing the same fluid as that which produced the Late Triassic compositions and therefore the 250 Ma ages may represent partial resetting of older ages by the Late Triassic thermal episode. However, if it is assumed that these K-Ar ages are not old ages partially reset by a thermal event, the stable isotope data could represent a mixing of Mid-Late Permian meteoric water with formation water trapped in the basin. This event may represent the regional compressive Hunter-Bowen event and may be responsible for dewatering the basin before the Late Triassic extensional episode.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drummond Basin</field><field name="subject">thermal history</field><field name="subject">fluid flow</field><field name="subject">age dating</field><field name="subject">clay minerals</field><field name="subject">stable isotopes</field><field name="subject">queensland</field><field name="subject">New England Fold Belt</field><field name="subject">tectonic history</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157931</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improvements to the prediction of ground settlements associated with shallow tunnels in weak rock</field><field name="creator">Asche, Harry Raoul</field><field name="description">Increasingly, tunnels are being planned in weak rock beneath urban areas in Australia and worldwide. Designers of these projects are required to predict the tunnel induced settlement so that an assessment of the possible effects on buildings and services above can be made. However, the existing methods for making such predictions require either a database of similar projects, or a knowledge of suitable parameters for use in numerical models. Numerical models of tunnelling are sensitive to model inputs. Some of these model inputs are irrelevant to the actual physical problem. The thesis discusses two key issues in solving elastoplastic tunnel problems, one being the inertial effects in finite difference methods, and the other being the mesh discretisation error. The causes and possible remedies for these is discussed, and an a priori predictive technique for discretisation error is developed. The method of choice for selecting parameters in numerical models is to use the backanalysis of a suitable pilot activity. However, traditional backanalysis methods suffer from non-uniqueness. The results of a backanalysis is not a single combination of parameters, but a zone in parameter space within which the fit to the observations is acceptable. The shape of this zone in parameter space is affected by the degree of correlation of the parameters, and by the non-linear nature of the problem. The technique of predictive analysis solves the problem of non-uniqueness in parameter estimation by backanalysis by choosing the point in parameter space which gives the most adverse prediction for the future construction, yet which maintains a reasonable fit to the pilot activity. The thesis uses three reference projects in Australia to show the techniques of backanalysis and predictive analysis. Cross sections of the Brisbane Rail Tunnels are backanalysed, and the resulting range in parameter space is discussed. For prediction of settlement in the New Southern Railway tunnel in Sydney, and the South East Transit project in Brisbane, the weak rock pressuremeter is proposed as a suitable and inexpensive pilot activity for the future tunnel construction. The results of the predictive analysis show that the method works. Therefore an improved method of predicting tunnel induced settlement in shallow tunnels is proposed, using the combination of numerical modelling, the weak rock pressuremeter and predictive analysis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tunnelling</field><field name="subject">settlement</field><field name="subject">backanalysis</field><field name="subject">finite element</field><field name="subject">mesh denisty</field><field name="subject">plasticity</field><field name="subject">pressuremeter</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157929</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Existence and Time : ethical and metaphysical questions concerning immortality and longevity</field><field name="creator">O'Brien, Carol Ann</field><field name="description">This dissertation is arranged in three parts which address issues concerning death and immortality. These issues all revolve around the temporal limit imposed by death. I have endeavoured to pose some questions which have relevance to a society clutching onto traditional notions of an afterlife despite its headlong thrust into a technologically advanced future where ethical confusions abound. In the first chapter I examine the metaphysics of the soul because postulating an afterlife is the conventional response to death anxiety. I have noticed that many people cling to hope of immortality without having any understanding of the metaphysical architecture of this hope. Consequently, from a philosophical perspective, I contrast arguments on the soul by Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas and Descartes. The second chapter emerges from a fascination with Epicurus's theory of living and, derivatively, of dying. It involves a comparison with (1) Aristotle's distinction between energeia (actuality) and kinesis (movement), and (2) the sybaritic hedonism of the Cyrenaics. Although the theme of this chapter is pleasure, it will be seen that pleasure lies embedded in the living project and is an important component in the drive for survival. In the third chapter I reflect on the meaning of life in conjunction with length of time lived. Here I compare the meaninglessness experienced by Leo Tolstoy (because his life is too short) and the meaninglessness experienced by the fictional character Elena Makropulos (because her life is too long). The Makropulos "case", both a play by Karel Capek and an opera by Leos Janacek, was introduced into the philosophical world by Bernard Williams.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">440103 Ethical Theory</field><field name="subject">Death</field><field name="subject">Immortality</field><field name="subject">longevity</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157928</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Impact of the Introduction of Computers into the Faculty of Health Science : a case study of organisational change</field><field name="creator">Zelmer, Adam Charles Lynn</field><field name="description">In 1989 the University of Central Queensland, Faculty of Health Science, committed itself to a major instructional development project for its nursing education program. This thesis is a case study report documenting and analysing the management of the resulting project, funded by both the National Priority Reserve Fund (NPRF) and the University, to develop computer-based learning materials. This study examines the project and its management from the perspective of the project participants to demonstrate the motivation for some of the decisions and their consequences. The study highlights some of the deficiencies of the project and its management, how they were resolved, and their consequences. Initially the study was seen as simply descriptive, using qualitative techniques that allowed the participants to describe the process and its results. As the project, and this study, progressed it became increasingly obvious that the participants were involved in changing a system where the most obvious challenge was change itself. The changes experienced were not only technological, but included a redefinition of the nursing education program, new roles and directions for the University, and the necessity to adapt to new management techniques and structures. This study includes excerpts from interviews with almost all of the staff and project students engaged in the first two years of the Health Science project, selected nursing students from the pre-registration program, staff and administrators from other areas of the University, and individuals involved as computer suppliers and consultants to the Project. Another source of data was the documentation generated by the operation and management of the project. This documentation included formal project papers and reports as well as day-to-day memorandums, electronic mail messages and other correspondence, formal and informal. This study was not intended to judge the success of the CAL/CML activities within the faculty of Health Science. Inevitably, however, participants and observers ask whether the activities were a success. The response has been mixed, and may depend upon the respondent's degree of involvement in the CAL/CML activities. From a short term perspective: o all of the staff and students use computers regularly, o many of the staff are involved in developing computer-based instructional materials, and o some staff are using the available tools to develop courseware that is very different from standard Health Science materials. As well, from its own budget Health Science funds computer support positions and infrastructure (hardware, software and network) upgrading. It is budgeting for an additional student lab, and has begun investigating multimedia applications. As the CAL/CML Academic Coordinator (1993, personal communication, 23 February) indicated: In hindsight, we've done at least two-thirds of what we started out to do-and the base is there-staff are committed to CAL. Some of them will never do any CAL development themselves, but they are all committed&#133; The real benefit is to the students. They are getting the benefit of the materials developed and in the pipeline&#133; and the materials and ideas are being taken elsewhere, through consultancies, etc. Issues addressed in the study include the novice's fear of computers, the use of electronic mail and related network services, the timing of change, project management, and staffing. Staffing issues include the use of students as technical experts, the acceptance of non-nursing staff in the development of nursing education materials, and the roles of academic and general staff in the development of instructional materials. The strategic direction provided through the CAL/CML Project faltered as staff size increased and institutional priorities changed. The challenge for Health Science is to develop a new strategic plan that takes into account the current institutional priorities, student needs, and technological realities. The strategic plan must provide a blueprint for the future that is sufficiently flexible to adapt to changing circumstances, people, budgets, and technologies. Finally, the Faculty must look at the form of its management as one of the strategies for achieving its goals.

Furthermore, wildtype BEV causes no or only mild clinical symptoms in its host and if BEV is used as a vaccine vector, reversion to wildtype phenotype would not cause deleterious effects in vaccinated cattle. To date many of the viruses used as vaccine vectors are produced by modifying the structural proteins of the virion so that they contain heterologous sequences. However, each of the four BEV structural proteins are essential and it is not possible to insert large sequences without disrupting the virion. While this study looks at potential insertion sites within the BEV virion, the main focus for the development of BEV as a vaccine vector is through using a replication-limited BEV vector. The development of a replication-limited vector requires the deletion of an essential viral gene that is then replaced in vitro using an expression vector. When the replication-limited vector and its complementing expression cassette are co-transfected into a permissive cell line all the proteins required for viral assembly are produced but only replication deficient genomes are available to be encapsidated. The physically intact but replication deficient viral particles produced in vitro can then infect permissive cells in vivo, resulting in the production of all but the deleted viral protein. Moreover, the deleted portion of the viral genome can be replaced with heterologous sequences within the replication-limited BEV vector. These heterologous sequences can then be expressed in vivo where they can be recognised by the host immune system. Three BEV isolates representing the Australian subserotypes were used in this study: K2577, SL305 and 66/27. The full-length sequences of K2577 and SL305 were obtained as well as partial sequence from the third isolate, 66/27. Sequence homology and phylogenetic analysis showed all three isolates were more closely related to BEV-1 subserotypes than BEV-2. This is the first report to indicate that Australian BEV isolates can be classified as BEV-1. Analysis of the 5&#146;-untranslated region (5&#146;-UTR) indicated that BEV isolates were recombinants with each other and that these recombinant regions correspond to the duplicated cloverleaf structure which is present in BEV 5&#146;-UTR but absent from other enteroviruses. While BEV was initially reported to be stable at higher temperatures, later studies showed that this property varied between isolates and this is also true of the three isolates used in this study. Since it is important not only to ensure that the isolate used as a vaccine vector is temperature stable but also the resulting vaccine vector, the molecular basis of BEV temperature stability was also studied. Using sequence data from the Australian isolates, regions of variation were located and hybrid BEV created. Unfortunately, all of the hybrid BEV produced in this study were non-infectious and could not be used to for further characterisation of BEV temperature stability. Preparatory to constructing replication-limited BEV, a system for full-length amplification of BEV was developed. By including sequences for the bacterial promoter T7 on the positive sense primer used for full-length amplification of BEV, it was possible to prepare full-length transcripts of the amplified product and these were shown to produce infectious BEV particles when transfected into to cell lines that supported BEV growth. Subsequent cloning of the K2577 amplification product resulted in infectious clones for this BEV isolate and these clones were used to prepare replication-limited BEV constructs. To test the replication-limited system BEV structural genes were replaced with a reporter gene to produce replication deficient infectious clones. Complementary constructs containing only the deleted structural genes were also prepared to express the deleted genes. While it was expected that these expression vector would be able to complement the replication deficient BEV in vivo, co-transfection of the replication-limited construct with its complementing expression vector did not produce viable BEV.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270303 Virology</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="subject">Bovine enterovirus</field><field name="subject">BEV</field><field name="subject">vaccine vector</field><field name="subject">phylogenetic analysis</field><field name="subject">virology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157925</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Richard Strauss : Heroism, auto-heroism and the musical self</field><field name="creator">Wu, Janice Pei-Yen</field><field name="description">The popular musico-historical image of Richard Strauss misrepresents both the composer and his music. As this thesis shows, such misrepresentation results from a failure to recognise the significance of Romantic heroic idealism to Strauss's compositional aesthetic. In his aesthetic, heroism operates at a fundamental level where musical self-representation exists as the expression of the Romantic heroic self and its subjectivity. This thesis, presented in two parts, examines firstly the concept of Romantic heroism, itself a misunderstood phenomenon, and, secondly, the ways that a deeper understanding of heroism functions as the underlying impetus for apprehending Strauss's approach to creativity. This creativity is tantamount to the composer's invention of a musical self. Chapter One examines nineteenth-century heroism as an ideological, aesthetic, and philosophical phenomenon, looking at how the early Romantics defined the hero and the centrality of notions of self-identity and self-consciousness to this definition. These notions legitimised subjectivity and realistic artistic self-portrayal. Chapters Two to Four examine literature, painting, and photography, respectively, as artistic spheres in which the idea of self became particularly pronounced. This is seen in the adoption of Romantic irony expressed as extreme realism. As a remedy for self-consciousness, this realism signalled the development towards the acute subjectivity of later nineteenth-century auto-heroism. Part Two, Chapters Five to Eight, considers Strauss's heroic allegiance, understood as an auto-heroic stage of heroism. His aesthetic notion of self is shown to have been specifically derived from social, national, and cultural spheres, all of which reinforced and demonstrated the realistic and auto-heroic expression of the musical self. Having established Strauss's historical reputation (Chapter Five) for the purpose of presenting the image which heroism amends, the idea of self obtaining from the social sphere of education (Chapter Six), and from the broader cultural and national outlooks suggested by Goethe (Chapter Seven) and Wagner (Chapter Eight), are considered. Within these chapters, the ways that these ideas of self are translated into the music itself are explored particularly in relation to the tone poems from Also sprach Zarathustra through to Eine Alpensinfonie. Romantic heroism enables Strauss's music to be understood as the product of a well-defined aesthetic theory within which self-representation is fully justified, thereby challenging the composer's predominating image.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Richard Strauss</field><field name="subject">auto heroic</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157924</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Potassium distribution in Ferrosols and its influence on rain-fed crop production in the South Burnett region of Queensland</field><field name="creator">White, Jonnie Rachelle</field><field name="description">The South Burnett region of Queensland is Australia's most important rainfed peanut (Arachis hypogea L.) production area. It also produces a considerable amount of cereal and grain legume crops. The cropping soils of the region are red, acid to neutral, clay loams that are classified as Ferrosols (Australian Soil Classification). Over 50 years of cropping on these soils has resulted in severe depletion of nutrient reserves, particularly potassium (K). In addition, the remaining K is predominantly confined to the surface 10 or 15cm of the soil profile, a feature commonly refered to as nutrient stratification. Dry periods during the summer cropping season are common due to the highly variable, summer-dominant rainfall pattern of the South Burnett. As topsoil dries out, crops forage for moisture and nutrients from lower in the soil profile where K reserves are smaller. It is therefore suspected that the combination of dry periods and stratified K reserves have resulted in an increasing incidence of K deficiency symptoms in summer crops. To investigate these issues, K relations of Ferrosols of the South Burnett were studied using soils from two representative sites. The pools of soil K that are important to crop growth in Ferrosols, and their interaction was examined through fractionation of soil K pools, and determination of quantity/intensity relationships, charge characteristics and clay mineralogy, and a leaching column study. A rapid K uptake period was identified for peanut and the effect of profile distribution and soil moisture during this period on K accessibility was studied in a divided column experiment. Finally, on-farm trials were used to evaluate commercial-scale options for improving K distribution in field profiles. It was found that the immediately available exchangeable K pool in these soils was the most important source of soil K, and was poorly buffered by slowly available non-exchangeable K. However the leaching column study revealed that K was preferentially adsorbed onto soil cation exchange sites, displacing calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) ions, and therefore was not susceptible to vertical movement within the soil profile. These observations helped to explain the development of stratified K profiles in these soil types. Peanut (cv. Streeton) was found to take up most of its K requirement between 25-70 days after planting. The divided column study showed that profile distribution, and topsoil iv moisture content during this rapid K uptake period, were able to affect the ability of peanut plants to access K. Plants that grew in low K soil, or where soil was dry at the site of K supply, had reduced access to K. However, improving access to K did not result in improved growth, but rather in a significant reduction in dry matter (DM) production, apparently due to interference in the availability of other nutrients, possibly phosphorus (P), magnesium (Mg) or boron (B). Field studies showed that application of K and profile inversion improved K uptake and DM production of various crop species. However, in most instances improved K uptake and DM production was not reflected in increased yield. It was suggested that a combination of agronomic factors, seasonal conditions and crop type prevented the expression of yield responses to improved K nutrition and these influences need to be understood. The findings of this project have important consequences for nutrition of crops grown on Ferrosols in the South Burnett region. Surface applied K cannot be expected to increase exchangeable K in the subsoil unless it is incorporated to depth. Similarly, band applied K will remain close to the site of application as a result of only limited vertical or lateral movement. This may affect the ability of roots to access band applied K. The ability of surface applied K to displace Ca and Mg from soil exchange sites may have negative implications for the Ca nutrition of developing peanut pods. On the other hand, it could present an opportunity for the movement of Ca into deeper soil layers to address the amelioration of acid subsoils. The unexplained negative responses to potassium chloride application and apparent effect on P, Mg or B nutrition need to be investigated.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300103 Soil Chemistry</field><field name="subject">620100 Field Crops</field><field name="subject">Oxisols</field><field name="subject">maize</field><field name="subject">soil chemistry</field><field name="subject">stratification</field><field name="subject">uptake</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157923</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An historical assessment of economic development, manufacturing and the political economy in Queensland, 1900 to 1930</field><field name="creator">Cameron, David Bruce</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">210303 Australian History (excl.

In chapter 3 I compared basic oculomotor parameters in three species of fish from the families Creediidae, Syngnathidae and Pinguipedidae, that show asynchronous eye movements and a fovea. All three species showed a close correlation between their specific retinal specialisation, oculomotor range and the lifestyles and feeding habits. Direction of gaze was correlated in the two independently moving eyes in both sandperch (Pinguipedidae) and pipefish (Syngnathidae) but not in the sandlance (Creediidae). Properties of spontaneous and fixational fast eye movements (saccades) in the species studied show many similarities to those found in other vertebrates. The apparent independence of the two eyes in the teleosts studied seem to set them apart from many other vertebrates, where eye movements are largely correlated with respect to each other. The results presented in chapter 4, however, reveal a regular switching of saccadic activity between the left and the right eye in sandlance, pipefish and sandperch, suggesting that the two eyes are in some way correlated. Since saccades are often a motor correlate of attention this finding suggests that these teleosts with asynchronous eye movements may show periodic shifts of attention while observing their environment. In chapter 5 the correlation between the two eyes was also tested during optokinetic nystagmus. This basic response shown by all animals stabilises the gaze against rotational head movements and translation. In most vertebrates the optokinetic response is tightly yoked in both eyes. This is also the case for the butterflyfish (Chaetodontidae) which shows strong yoking of the eyes during spontaneous eye movements. However some capacity for independent optokinesis in the two eyes was observed. Both sandlance and pipefish are capable of following two conflicting stimuli independently. However monocular occlusion in the pipefish unmasks a link between the two eyes, which is overridden when both eyes receive visual input. The sandlance never showed any correlation between eyes during optokinesis, even during monocular stimulation. This suggests that there are different levels of linkage between the two eyes in the oculomotor system of teleosts, depending on the visual input. One of the main functions of the oculomotor system in vertebrates and most invertebrates is to keep the image of the world relatively still on the retina. As shown in chapter 6 the sandlance breaks this universal rule of image stabilisation by showing large postsaccadic drifting eye movements as part of its normal oculomotor behaviour. In these animals, up to 40% of spontaneous saccades are followed by a drifting movement, either binocularly or in one eye only. The drifts are large and are always directed towards the most relaxed position of the eye, indicating that this form of eye movement is not visually driven. However the eye is visually responsive and saccades and an optokinetic response can be elicited during a drift. The drifting speed and the known acuity of the sandlance eye suggest that, during the drift, the image quality is not degraded. Several advantages of this unusual oculomotor behaviour can be related to the unusual optics and lifestyle of the sandlance. A unique modification of the eye muscles of billfish (Xiphiidae) maintains the eye and brain above ambient temperature; however the function of this adaptation and its effect on the oculomotor system is unknown. Chapter 7 aims to provide an insight into the visual abilities of billfish derived from anatomical observations of their retinal structure. The observations help explain the effect the increased retinal temperature might have for vision and eye movements. The blue marlin (Makaira nigricans) shows a well developed temporal area centralis and no visual streak, suggesting that a functional oculomotor system is required in this fish. A convergence of cones to ganglion cells at a ratio of at least 5:1 is present even in the area of highest acuity. The finding of two cone types suggest that the animal is capable of wavelength discrimination. Regional differences in size and composition of photoreceptors between dorsal and ventral retina potentially affect colour vision and sensitivity. The anatomical results suggest that sensitivity and spatial summation are of high priority to billfish. The possible function of the warm retina for increasing temporal resolution is discussed. These findings show the adaptability of the oculomotor system to suit the needs of different teleost lifestyles. However most of the parameters established for the oculomotor system of higher vertebrates also hold for teleosts.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Visual Ecology</field><field name="subject">Fish</field><field name="subject">Oculomotor Behaviour</field><field name="subject">Comparative Neurophysiology</field><field name="subject">Retina</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157919</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing the potential contribution of renewable energy to electricity supply in Australia: A study of renewable energy with a particular focus upon domestic rooftop photovoltaics, domestic solar hot water and commercial wind energy</field><field name="creator">Mills, David</field><field name="description">Renewable energy has become the world's fastest growing energy source as a direct result of increasing concerns about the environmental damage that is being caused by fossil fuel and nuclear energy use. With the exception of large-scale hydro, however, very little of Australia's electricity is supplied from renewable energy. Due to our lack of experience with the use of most renewable energy technologies and the associated lack of knowledge regarding their true potential, doubts remain as to how much electricity could be generated or displaced by renewable energy. Although renewable energy industries in Australia have recently begun to experience strong growth, this growth could be curtailed if there is a lack of faith in the potential for renewable energy. The aim of this study is to further our understanding of the potential for renewable energy to contribute to electricity supply in Australia. This aim is achieved through the development and demonstration of methodologies for estimating potential electricity production from key renewable energy resources. The study demonstrates how methodologies for assessing the potential contribution of key renewable energy resources to electricity supply in Australia can be developed utilising a spatial assessment of important resource variables within the context of plausible utilisation of renewable energy resources. A literature review provides the basis for an assessment of the current state of knowledge regarding the use of renewable energy for electricity supply in Australia. The range of different renewable energy technologies is canvassed, brief descriptions of the technologies are presented and an appraisal is made of their commercial development status. The extent to which different renewable energy technologies have been utilised for electricity supply in Australia and prospects for near-future developments are described. Scenario analysis is used to provide insights into future development paths for renewable energy. This assists in the identification of key renewable energy technologies that will be examined in more detail and it helps in the setting of parameters for assessments of these technologies. Three scenarios are presented and these provide a framework for an analysis of possible contributions by renewable energy to electricity supply in Australia. Of those technologies that could potentially make significant contributions to electricity supply in the near term, utility scale wind energy, domestic rooftop photovoltaics (rooftop BIPV) and domestic solar hot water (SHW) stand out as being key technologies where further research in relation to resource assessment would be beneficial. The dispersed nature of the resource bases utilised by these technologies has made it difficult to assess how much electricity they could generate or displace. Conventional methods of assessing electricity generation or displacement, based upon project or site-specific analyses, have not proven amenable to analyses of the total amount of electricity that could be generated or displaced by these technologies throughout Australia. Therefore, alternative methods for assessing the potential of these technologies are needed. New models for analysing wind, BIPV and SHW performance are developed in this study. These models demonstrate the application of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) for wind, BIPV and SHW resource mapping. Wind energy maps for Australia are created showing actual wind speeds suitable for use at elevations appropriate for wind turbines. These maps represent significant advances over traditional wind atlases used in other nations due to their presentation of estimated actual wind speeds, rather than isovent lines for idealised wind speed gradients. The use of GIS for analysing BIPV and SHW resources also represents a significant departure from traditional modelling processes and demonstrates a means of overcoming important limitations of existing BIPV and SHW evaluation tools. The wind, BIPV and SHW resource mapping processes that have been developed and applied in this study show how broad-area assessments of electricity supply or displacement can be produced for technologies where spatial variations in key performance attributes constrain the use of traditional modelling processes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Renewable energy</field><field name="subject">resource mapping</field><field name="subject">GIS solar energy</field><field name="subject">wnd energy</field><field name="subject">photovoltaics</field><field name="subject">solar hot water</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157920</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Asset revaluations and debt contracting</field><field name="creator">Cotter, Julie</field><field name="description">The research question investigated is &#147;Do managers of Australian firms use upward asset revaluations to reduce debt contracting costs?&#148; Much work in the accounting choice literature is premised on a relation between debt contracts and accounting policies. In particular, prior research using sample periods from the 1970s and early 1980s, provides evidence that asset revaluations are used to reduce the costs of debt contracting (see Whittred and Chan, 1992; Brown, Izan and Loh, 1992; and Cotter and Zimmer, 1995). However, considerable changes to the institutional setting have occurred in the past decade. These institutional changes include increased regulation of asset revaluations and disclosures, changes in the macroeconomic environment, and changes in the Australian debt market. Particularly, there has been a shift in emphasis from public to private debt. The relationship between asset revaluations and debt contracting is examined in the current setting. Following Watts and Zimmerman&#146;s (1990) suggestion that research into the relationship between firms&#146; contracts and their accounting policy choices will be improved by the use of more refined measures of contracting variables, the research commences with an investigation of the terms contained in recently issued debt contracts. Accordingly, this thesis contains two phases. Part A comprises an investigation of the covenants and accounting measurement rules typically contained in the recent debt contracts of listed Australian firms, with an emphasis on the role of asset revaluations. Part B then uses the outcomes of this investigation to determine the refined measures of debt contract terms used in testing hypotheses about the current relationship between asset revaluations and debt contracting. Part A establishes the current dominance of bank loan financing, along with a dramatic decline in the use of public debt. Details of the terms typically contained in bank loan agreements, particularly those relating to asset revaluations, are then investigated using a questionnaire survey of senior corporate bankers and analysis of a small sample of actual contracts. Outstanding public debt contracts are also analysed and compared with private debt contracts. The results of this phase of the research indicate that leverage covenants are the most widely used accounting based covenant in the bank loan agreements of listed Australian firms. In addition, interest coverage, current, tangible net worth, and prior charges ratios are all frequently used. Covenants tend to be less restrictive for larger firms than for smaller firms, and more restrictive for mineral producers than for industrial firms. Covenants contained in bank loan agreements tend to be more restrictive than those contained in convertible note trust deeds. In addition to providing important data for part B, the results of this phase of the research address an important gap in our knowledge about the terms contained in recently issued public and private debt contracts of listed Australian firms. Part B develops hypotheses based on the assumption that the costs of revaluing will be incurred when they are expected to be less than reductions in the costs of debt contracting derived from the revaluation. Due consideration is given to the likelihood that at least some of these costs have changed since prior research was conducted. In addition to the arguments presented in prior asset revaluations research, the expected costs of default on debt contracts, and the accounting discretion available to managers, are investigated as determinants of asset revaluation accounting choices. Predictions are made in relation to the likelihood of revaluation, the choice of valuer type, and whether to recognise or merely disclose new valuations of land and buildings. Interestingly, the results of prior research do not replicate in the current setting. Further analysis shows that differences in results are not due to differences in research methods between the current and prior research. In order to further examine the potential impact of changes to the institutional setting, a series of interviews with Chief Financial Officers is undertaken. The conclusion drawn from this additional analysis is that the relatively closer relationship between firms and their bankers has caused many firms to choose footnote disclosure of undervalued assets in preference to recognising an upward asset revaluation in the balance sheet. Overall, the results indicate that, when investigating the relationship between firms&#146; contracts and their accounting policy choices, a consideration of the way that contracts are negotiated and monitored is potentially more important than the use of refined measures of contract terms.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">asset revaluations</field><field name="subject">debt covenants</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157918</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Police and Trauma : A prospective examination of the psychological effects of occupational exposure to traumatic events</field><field name="creator">Rallings, Mark</field><field name="description">The effects of occupational exposure to traumatic events were examined in two studies of Queensland (Australia) Police Officers. A cross-sectional pilot study of 237 experienced police officers was conducted to develop three survey instruments and to provide preliminary tests of research hypothesis. A prospective study of 100 inexperienced officers examined participants as police recruits, before they were exposed to occupational trauma, and assessed them at two subsequent occasions over a one year period following commencement of police work. Five research questions were addressed by the prospective study: a) What is the nature and extent of occupational trauma exposure in police officers? b) What is the nature and extent of trauma-specific and non-specific morbidity in police officers? c) What is the relationship between police work-related trauma exposure and morbidity? D) What are the determinants and concomitants of sequelae associated with occupational trauma exposures? and e) What characterises the phenomenology of response to police work-related trauma? The pilot study measured participants' sociodemographic characteristics, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms, characteristics of exposure to a participant nominated work-related traumatic event, peritraumatic dissociative phenomena, and attendance at a Critical Incident Stress Debriefing using self-report questionnaires. Instruments were developed to assess the frequency and impact of exposure to police work-related traumatic incidents, to measure peritraumatic phenomena, and to examine work-place hassles and climate. Results of the pilot study indicated that work-related traumatic events were ubiquitous. Ninety-five percent of participants reported experiencing a work-related traumatic event some time in their career. Eight percent of participants reported clinically significant PTSD symptomatology associated with a work-related event. Other significant predictors of symptomatology were the cumulative impact of work-related trauma exposure, participants' rank, work-place characteristics, and peritraumatic-phenomena. Participation in a Critical Incident Stress Debriefing (CISD) was not related to reported symptomatology. In the prospective study, data were obtained on the nature and extent of occupational trauma exposure (characteristics of exposure to a participant nominated most-traumatic work-related event, and the frequency and impact of concurrent occupational trauma exposure), the nature and extent of trauma-specific and non-specific morbidity (PTSD, anxiety, depression and somatic symptoms, general psychological distress, and alcohol consumption and smoking behaviour), and characteristics of putative determinants of morbidity (sociodemographic characteristics, personality constructs, parental relationship characteristics, cognitive constructs, significant life events, coping processes. Social support, work-environment characteristics, CISD participation and peritraumatic phenomena). Consistent with the results of the pilot study, 95% of participants in the prospective study reported clinically significant PTSD symptomatology. Non-specific morbidity rates indicated a general trend of deterioration of participants' health and well-being over the three assessment periods. Of event characteristics, only participants' ratings of the subjective severity (impact) of an event emerged as a significant predictor of symptom measures, with greater severity ratings being associated with higher symptom scores. Similarly, cumulative subject severity ratings of concurrent event exposure were correlates of morbidity measures, whereas frequency ratings of those same events were not. Important determinants of morbidity were found to be greater peritraumatic reactivity and dissociation, greater neuroticism, greater use of coping strategies overall, less reported social support, poorer self-worth, greater number of significant life events, and poorer work-place climate characteristics. As with the result of the pilot study, CISD attendance was not related to reported symptoms. Further examination of the role of peritraumatic phenomena indicated evidence of mediational relationships between peritraumatic phenomena and the morbidity determinants; neuroticism, self-worth, significant life events, coping strategies, social support, work-place climate and comorbidity. A significant interaction between the cumulative impact of concurrent occupational trauma exposure and peritraumatic phenomena indicated that participants who reported greater overall impact of concurrent event exposure and greater peritraumatic phenomena also reported greater Symptomatology associated with a particular event. The findings of this research provide the basis for strategies to more effectively manage the effects of occupational trauma exposure. The modulation of peritraumatic phenomena may prove central to the mitigation of the effects of work-related traumatic event exposure. The cumulative effects of long term exposure to occupational trauma may account for the discrepancy in PTSD morbidity rates between the two studies, and may point to a second promising area of future research. Prospective multi-method research using large samples assessed over several years is required to further develop the construct of peritraumatic phenomena and to examine the chronic effects of occupational trauma exposure.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Police</field><field name="subject">trauma</field><field name="subject">occupational trauma</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157917</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling Insect Cell-Baculovirus Dynamics</field><field name="creator">Rosinski, Matthew</field><field name="description">Minimising the time from 'scientific breakthrough'to clinical trial of a 'drug candidate' protein is a critical component leading to a successful product release. Crystallographic characterisation has become a standard requirement prior to clinical trial requiring milligram quantities of protein. The optimisation of protein expression systems is therefore of great commercial and social importance and represents a significant technical challenge. Without it, making enough protein for crystallography can quite literally take years. Baculoviral expression of recombinant protein by infection of an insect cell host is a well established technique in modern biotechnology. Although a limit to recombinant protein production in batch culture exists the mechanism has not been demonstrated. In particular, there has been no discussion of how biomass accumulation kinetics relate to the system limits in terms of final recombinant protein yield. The central aim of this thesis was therefore to quantitatively account for the dynamic behaviour in macromolecular compartments after baculovirus infection of insect cells, the rationale being that a rudimentary level of mechanistic structure can greatly enhance our ability to capture transient behaviour. The catalytic mass dictates the rate of total biomass accumulation in the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) and is directly proportional to the total RNA content of both baculovirus infected and uninfected Sf9 cells. During infection the total RNA concentration reaches a catalytic limit causing a switch from exponential to zero order mass accumulation kinetics. Importantly, this extends to individual cells as confirmed using a population balance model for the cell volume distribution after the switch to linear growth. By flow cytometry, a positive correlation between RNA content and cell size post infection validated this modelling assumption. The rate of mass accumulation slows down during the first 12 hours post infection (hpi). This is consistent with the decrease in both specific consumption rates of glucose and oxygen when using cell mass rather than cell number as a basis. A decrease in the geometric standard deviation (&#243;g) of the cell volume distribution during the first 12 hpi indicates that cells enter the lower growth rate at times inversely proportional to their volume. Using several approaches no obvious biological mechanism to account for the empirical model was identified. The use of &#243;g kinetics provides a novel tool for characterising the relative behaviour of infected cells in the BEVS. The effect of multiplicity of infection (MOI) on virus timing events between cultures was also tested. Little or no effect of MOI was observed on the timing of virus induced events during synchronous infections. The &#243;g kinetics did indicate virus events occur 5 hours earlier at a MOI of 100 compared to a MOI of 20 plaque forming units per cell. There was however, no significant evidence of earlier death kinetics when measured using Trypan blue dye exclusion to measure cell membrane integrity. Virtually no effect of MOI on virus timing was observed using &#226;-galactosidase production profiles. The viral DNA mass (vDNA) was measured using real time quantitative PCR (RTQ PCR) and has a doubling time of 2 hours. A vDNA template limited replication model fit the data well. Viral replication proceeds from 6 until 24 hpi with the average infected cell accumulating between 12 000 and 84 000 vDNA copies when replication stops. In theory, a dynamic equilibrium could have been present after the commencement of virus budding but this was not the case. At least 62% of the total DNA increase post infection is viral. No more than 16% of the total vDNA produced actually bud from the infected cell. This overproduction of vDNA is probably due to the wild type history of the virus, which normally occludes virions in a crystalline polyhedrin matrix within the cell nucleus as part of its life cycle. The approach taken here provides a framework for characterisation of both viral and total mass accumulation with the use of a few simple intracellular macromolecular pools. This thesis demonstrates that the BEVS limit in batch culture is not simply a result of the exhaustion of an amino acid using a case study of amino acid consumption by uninfected Sf9 cells for a 300 hour culture period. Future attempts to identify the system limits and will require the linkage of a mechanistic model with a more extensive and accurate analysis of important metabolites and specific intracellular species.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Crystallography</field><field name="subject">recombinant protein</field><field name="subject">baculovirus</field><field name="subject">viral</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157915</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling of Sulphate Reduction in Anaerobic Wastewater Treatment Systems</field><field name="creator">Haris, Abdul</field><field name="description">Municipal wastewater and industrial wastewaters like those effluents from brewery, citric acid production, tannery, pulp and paper industry, and mussel processing contain sulphate ranging from 20 mg.L-1 to 11400 mg.L-1. When these wastewaters are treated in an anaerobic system like prefermentors or anaerobic digesters the sulphate is reduced to sulphide by sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB). The presence of sulphate reduction is not desirable as it may reduce methane yield due to partial substrate utilisation by SRB, causes system toxicity and the production of malodor H2S in the gas phase. In this thesis, the effects of operational conditions on sulphate transformation and assimilation was studied in a laboratory scale anaerobic wastewater treatment system. The laboratory scale system consisted of two reactors the first one a well-mixed fermentor (referred to as an acidogenic reactor) and the second an expanded granular sludge blanket reactor (referred to as a methanogenic reactor) with pH and temperature control. Two sets of studies were performed; in the first set both reactors were connected serially to represent a two-stage high-rate anaerobic treatment system. The system was fed molasses and operated at temperature of 35oC. The acidogenic reactor was controlled at pH of 6 while the methanogenic reactor was controlled at pH of 7.2 by automatic addition of caustic. In the second set of experiments only the first reactor was used to represent a prefermentor and the first stage of the two stage. The reactor was fed with glucose at various concentrations, operated at pH of 6 and temperature of 35oC. Information gained from these studies was encapsulated in a mathematical model to describe sulphate reduction in anaerobic treatment systems. This model was also validated using data generated from the experiments. The experimental study showed that &#183; At low sulphate concentrations of about 250 mg.L-1 and COD concentration of 10,000 mg.L-1 in feed, relatively high percentage (up to 35 %) of produced sulphide was assimilated by biomass, while the rest of the sulphur was distributed as unconverted sulphate, dissolved sulphide, H2S gas and to a lesser extent as metallic sulphide precipitates. &#183; The major electron donor for sulphate reduction in both the acidogenic and the methanogenic reactor was hydrogen gas. Therefore, sulphate reduction not only competed with hydrogen utilising methanogens for the available hydrogen, but also changed the distributions of organic acids, which were directly or indirectly influenced by the H2 partial pressure. &#183; Sulphide concentrations of up to 6.5 mM free hydrogen sulphide) at pH of 7.2 was not inhibitory to methanogens &#183; Sulphate reducing bacteria were able to grow even at a low hydraulic retention time of 1.2 hours in the well-mixed acidogenic reactor. It was estimated that the maximum specific growth rate (m) and half saturation constant (ks) of SRB was 1.31 h-1 and 3.8 mg S.L-1, respectively. These values were higher than those reported in literature. &#183; Sulphate reduction was suppressed at high concentration of carbon in the feed. Accumulation of high concentration of volatile organic acids at high feed-carbon concentrations had little effect on sulphate reduction. However, extent of sulphate reduction had a negative correlation with total concentration of biomass. A non-competitive biomass inhibition function was proposed to model the correlation. From this fit it was estimated that a biomass concentration of about 3300 mg-COD.L-1 will completely inhibit sulphate reduction. &#183; Sulphate reduction was affected by redox potential control and pH in the acidogenic reactor. High pH and low redox potential values were essential for sulphate reduction to proceed. At redox potential control of -300 mV, sulphate reduction was inhibited more at pH of 6 than it was at pH of 7. At redox potential values of -250 mV or higher, about 90 % inhibition of sulphate reduction was observed at both pH of 6 and 7. An existing model describing carbohydrate degradation was extended to include sulphate reduction processes. Despite experimentally observing that sulphate reduction only took place from hydrogen, all possible substrates for sulphate reducion was considered. These included: lactic acid, butyric acid, propionic acid, acetic acid and hydrogen. Kinetic parameters for sulphate reduction processes were obtained from documented literature. Inhibition of sulphate reduction by biomass and sulphur assimilation by biomass were included in the model. A new approach to calculate caustic consumption at given pH values was also included. A modification to hydrogen regulation function was also made to better predict product distributions as a function of gas-phase hydrogen concentration. Model validation was performed using data from dynamic experiments. Comparison to actual data was undertaken on several key variables in the acidogenic and methanogenic reactors such as: organic acid concentrations, gas compositions, gas production rates, sulphate and sulphide concentrations and caustic consumption rates. The model satisfactorily predicted sulphate and sulphide concentrations in both reactors. However, discrepancy between predicted and experimental data on organic carbon concentrations was seen, especially during organic carbon concentration step changes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">290700 Resources Engineering</field><field name="subject">760200 Environmental and Resource Evaluation</field><field name="subject">sulphate reduction</field><field name="subject">anaerobic digestion</field><field name="subject">high-rate reactor</field><field name="subject">acidification</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157916</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Applying Formal Methods to Software Testing</field><field name="creator">Stocks, Philip Alan</field><field name="description">This thesis examines applying formal methods to software testing. Software testing is a critical phase of the software life-cycle which can be very effective if performed rigorously. Formal specifications offer the bases for rigorous testing practices. Not surprisingly, the most immediate use of formal specifications in software testing is as sources of black-box test suites. However, formal specifications have more uses in software testing than merely being sources for test data. We examine these uses, and show how to get more assistance and benefit from formal methods in software testing. At the core of this work is a exible framework in which to conduct specification-based testing. The framework is founded on formal definitions of tests and test suites, which directly addresses important issues in managing software testing. This provides a uniform platform for other applications of formal methods to testing such as analysis and reification of tests, and also for applications beyond testing such as maintenance and specification validation. The framework has to be exible so that any testing strategies can be used. We examine the need to adapt certain strategies to work with the framework and formal specification. Our experiments showed some deficiencies that arise when using derivation strategies on abstract specifications. These deficiencies led us to develop two new specification-based testing strategies based on extensions to existing strate- gies. We demonstrate the framework, strategies, and other applications of formal methods to software testing using three case studies. In each of these, the framework was easy to use. It provided an elegant and powerful means for defining and structuring tests, and a suitable staging ground for other applications of formal methods to software testing. This thesis demonstrates how formal specification techniques can systematise the application of testing strategies, and also how the concepts of software testing can be combined with formal specifications to extend the role of the formal specification in software development.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Software testing</field><field name="subject">formal methods</field><field name="subject">Z notation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157914</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A REAL-TIME EXAMINATION OF LEXICAL AMBIGUITY RESOLUTION FOLLOWING LESIONS OF THE DOMINANT NONTHALAMIC SUBCORTEX</field><field name="creator">Copland, David Andrew</field><field name="description">The role of the basal ganglia in human language function remains unknown, despite a corpus of literature documenting the association between vascular lesions of the dominant nonthalamic subcortical (NS) region and disordered language. Theories of subcortical language function have been postulated (e.g., Crosson, 1985; Wallesch &amp; Papagno, 1988), however, research in this field has remained largely data-driven, providing limited descriptions of individuals with vascular NS lesions in terms of performance on standard off-line language measures. This approach has failed to reveal the underlying nature of these language deficits &#194;&#147;locally&#194;&#148; in terms of various dynamic and temporally constrained linguistic and nonlinguistic component processes. The current series of studies are based largely on the premise that such empirical data has the potential to speak more directly to the cogency of current theories proposing a subcortical role in language or related cognitive functions. The present thesis investigated the performance of individuals with dominant chronic vascular NS lesions, compared to matched control subjects, individuals with Parkinson&#194;&#146;s disease (PD) (also assumed to have NS dysfunction) and subjects with cortical lesions (CL), on a series of experiments which allowed for the real-time examination of language processing, manipulating the degree to which automatic and attentional/strategic processing is invoked. The theoretical underpinning of these experiments hinges primarily on the proposed role of frontal-subcortical systems in mediating aspects of language via attentional/strategic mechanisms. Accordingly, it was hypothesised that the locus of impairment for individuals with NS lesions would be centred selectively on those facets of language processing which require increased recourse to these proposed frontal-subcortical cognitive capacities. The language abilities of 15 subjects with chronic dominant NS lesions, 15 matched control subjects, 14 matched subjects with CL, and 12 matched individuals with PD were examined initially on the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) and the Boston Naming Test (BNT). Most NS subjects were classified as non-aphasic according to the WAB, however, circumscribed deficits were evidenced, typically in generative and confrontation naming. In contrast, the CL group showed significant deficits on most aspects of the WAB compared to matched normal control subjects, and presented with a more severe impairment than NS subjects overall on the WAB and in confrontation naming and repetition. The PD group performance was not significantly different from the matched control group, while PD subjects performed better than the NS group overall on the WAB. The same cohort of NS, CL, PD, and control subjects undertook a battery of complex language measures designed to place a range of higher-order cognitive demands on the language processing system. This battery included subtests from the Test of Language Competence-Expanded Edition (TLC-E), the Test of Word Knowledge (TOWK), and The Word Test-Revised (TWT-R). The NS, CL, and PD subjects presented with marked disturbances in those tasks involving cognitive-linguistic flexibility, sentence formulation, indeterminacy of meaning, and metalinguistic manipulation of the lexical-semantic system. Collectively, the off-line results suggest that those aspects of language processing which are more heavily reliant on higher-order cognitive capacities are selectively compromised in subjects with NS lesions and PD. This assumption was further examined and substantiated in a series of on-line lexical ambiguity priming experiments performed by a subset of the original NS subjects (n = 10), matched control subjects (n = 10), matched CL subjects (n=10), and matched PD subjects (n = 10). When lexical ambiguities were presented in a single word context as word triplets, NS subjects showed rapid nonselective lexical activation, suggesting that intact lexical-semantic information could be accessed via automatic routines, similar to control subjects. Unlike control subjects, however, NS subjects were unable to sustain any form of significant activation, implying a selective impairment in the ability to manipulate lexical-semantic information through attentional/controlled processing. This breakdown was qualitatively different to the controlled processing disturbance evidenced by CL subjects, who maintained nonselective meaning facilitation over time, while PD subjects showed a pattern of selective priming consistent with a reduction in attentional processing. The emerging picture of a dissociation between intact automatic processing and compromised attentional/strategic lexical processing in the NS subjects was further elucidated in an experiment examining the processing of unequibiased lexical ambiguities in isolation. In this study, NS and PD subjects showed rapid nonselective meaning facilitation, again implying intact automatic lexical processing. While control and CL subjects evidenced multiple meaning activation followed by selective facilitation of the dominant meaning, NS and PD subjects were unable to achieve selective meaning facilitation, instead showing a protracted period of nonselective lexical activation. This finding suggested that when ambiguities were encountered in isolation, there was not an absolute breakdown in attentional processing per se, but rather a circumscribed deficit in the selective attentional engagement of the semantic network on the basis of meaning frequency, possibly implicating a disturbance of inhibitory mechanisms within the semantic network. A cross-modal priming experiment was used to investigate how lexical ambiguities were processed and resolved in a biased sentential context. Initially, lexical activation for the neurological patient groups appeared influenced by contextual information to a greater extent than in normal controls, which may indicate delayed lexical decision making or disturbed automatic lexical access. Only the PD and NS individuals failed to then maintain selective facilitation of the contextually appropriate meaning, suggesting a breakdown in the attention-based control and maintenance of semantic activation on the basis of integrated sentential constraints. This finding was extended in another cross-modal priming experiment, where NS and PD subjects appeared unable to use discourse-level information to select meanings and develop topical inferences via attentional/strategic mechanisms, while CL subjects showed a selective disturbance of inference development. The results of this thesis have served to delineate certain dynamic aspects of language processing in individuals with NS lesions in terms of automatic lexical processing components and processes involving the attentional/strategic selection of meaning on the basis of meaning frequency and various types of contextual information. In general, the NS group showed a demarcation between intact automatic processing and a breakdown in attentional/strategic processing which was manifest differently depending on the conditions under which processing was invoked. Furthermore, the performance of NS subjects on attentional operations was able to be dissociated under certain conditions from CL group performance and was similar to the PD group&#194;&#146;s performance in certain instances. These preliminary findings are consistent with recent theories proposing a role for frontal-subcortical systems in the &#194;&#147;top-down&#194;&#148; modulation of semantic processing via executive attentional and strategic mechanisms. Although a disturbance in these systems provides a parsimonious explanation of the NS and PD group performance, such conclusions are drawn tentatively with the caveat that the precise neuropathological basis of cognitive-linguistic deficits in these individuals remains unclear at present.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">basal ganglia</field><field name="subject">language</field><field name="subject">semantic</field><field name="subject">priming</field><field name="subject">lexical ambiguity</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157913</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simultaneous nitrification and denitrification in wastewater treatment process</field><field name="creator">Pochana, Klangduen</field><field name="description">The principle aim of this study was to gain an understanding of the conditions and processes governing the occurrence of simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND). SND is the process that combines nitrification and denitrification in the same reactor (at the same time) under fully aerobic conditions. From various studies, two main hypotheses, one physical and one biological, have been proposed to explain SND (Simultaneous Nitrification and Denitrification). Significant research has been performed on the biological aspects, whereas relatively little is known about the physical explanation. Therefore, further investigations of physical explanation on SND (Simultaneous Nitrification and Denitrification) are carried out in this thesis. To fulfill this principal objective, two major tasks were preformed: experimental studies and model development. The experimental investigation was conducted using lab scale sequencing batch reactors (SBR). The operating conditions of the reactors were varied corresponding to the aim of each experiment. The influent wastewater was collected from the effluent of an anaerobic pond at an abattoir wastewater treatment plant. The main experimental studies focused on three factors, the effect of soluble organic carbon, floc size and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations, on the SND activity. The results revealed that all these factors had a significant influence on the degree of SND achieved. Almost 50% of inorganic nitrogen lost by SND (Simultaneous Nitrification and Denitrification) could be achieved when operating at a soluble COD:TKN ratio of 6. A dramatic increase in SND activity to 85% was found when this ratio reached 10. With a soluble COD:TKN ratio of 15, complete nitrogen removal by SND could be achieved. The effect of dissolved oxygen (DO) was equally strong. SND could completely occur at very low DO concentrations (0.2 mg/L). However, the nitrogen removal in this range was substantially limited by the low nitrification rate. To improve the nitrification rate but still achieve effective denitrification, a DO concentration of around 0.4-0.5 mg/L seems to be an optimal value to maintain a significant degree of SND. In this range, the nitrification rate reached 50% of the rate found at DO of 1.1 mg/L and 60% SND activity was achieved. The effect of bacterial floc size on SND was also quite remarkable. It was found that an SBR operating with a median floc size of 80 mm could achieve 80% SND, whereas the SND activity decreased to only 50% after the median floc size was reduced to 40 mm in the following treatment cycle. A complete nitrogen balance over the whole process was performed to confirm the occurrence of SND in such systems. Under typical operating conditions, it was found that the nitrogen gas was the major nitrogen product of the treatment process (approximately 58% of the total output). 14% of nitrogen was assimilated to biomass whereas 23 % of nitrogen at the end of the process was in the soluble form (organic nitrogen, nitrite, nitrate and ammonium). The mathematical dynamic model was developed to gain a better understanding of SND in the situation that is difficult to investigate experimentally. The overall model structure can be divided into 4 main areas : 1. a &#145;micro&#146; level model for a single floc 2. the reaction rates for a single floc size 3. the reaction rates for the entire reactor considering the floc size distribution 4. a &#145;macro&#146; model for the whole reactor including the operational changes throughout the cycle. It was found that the model can predict the SND behavior well for the system operating under typical influent characteristics (SCOD:TKN of 10). However, poor predictions were found at different levels of SCOD:TKN. Two crucial reasons can be given. Firstly, this model did not include intracellular carbon storage by bacteria. Secondly, many parameters, especially floc and microorganism characteristics (i.e. intra floc biomass distribution, growth and decay of the microorganism, etc.) could not be determined or estimated accurately. However, under normal operating conditions of this study, the model advances the fundamental understanding of SND process in activated sludge system. The simulation results showed that both floc diameter and liquid phase concentration are important factors influencing the internal floc concentrations. It was also predicted that an anoxic microzone, caused by oxygen diffusion limitation, potentially occurs in the floc center. This microzone therefore enhances denitrification activity inside the floc. A number of major conclusions can be drawn from this thesis: 1. SND potentially occurs as a result of physical phenomenon 2. high soluble COD is beneficial to SND activity 3. suitable floc size distribution (with more large flocs) can enhance SND 4. major nitrogenous product of the treatment process is nitrogen gas 5. dissolved oxygen optimization is critical to get good nitrification rate and SND.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SND</field><field name="subject">nitrification</field><field name="subject">denitrification</field><field name="subject">SBR</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157912</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Insulin signal transduction pathways that regulate glucose metabolism in adipocytes</field><field name="creator">Hill, Michelle Mei Chih</field><field name="description">Insulin stimulates glucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissue by translocating glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) from an intracellular storage sige to the cellsurface. Studies have shown that insulin-activation of PI3K is required for stimulatin of GLUT4 translocation, however, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) also activates PI3K in adipocytes without significant effects on GLUT4 localisation. The aim of this study is to examine the hypothesis that insulin stimulates anunique signalling pathway that regulates GLUT4 translocation in adipocytes, and to identify novel signalling candidates in this pathway. A proteomic approach was employed to compare the effect of insulin versus PDGF on protein phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, using high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) in combination with 32P-metabolic labelling and autoradiography. The effect of wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3K, on insulin-induced phosphorylation was also examined as a further screen for selection of candidate phosphoproteins for insulin-stimulation of GLUT4 translocation. Three subcellular Insulin stimulates glucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissue by translocating glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) from an intracellular storage site to the cell surface. Studies have shown that insulin-activation of PI3K is required for stimulation of GLUT4 translocation, however, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) also activates PI3K in adipocytes without significant effects on GLUT4 localisation. The aim of this study is to examine the hypothesis that insulin stimulates an unique signalling pathway that regulates GLUT4 translocation in adipocytes, and to identify novel signalling candidates in this pathway. fractions were extensively examined, the plasma membrane (PM) fraction, the cytosol fraction and a high speed pellet (HSP) fraction that contains the insulin-responsive pool of GLUT4. These studies showed that phosphorylation of 18 proteins were consistently increased by insulin treatment, with 8 proteins in the cytosol, 10 proteins in the HSP and none in the PM. The phosphorylation of 6 cytosolic and 2 HSP insulin-stimulated phosphoproteins were also significantly increased by PDGF treatment. Wortmannin inhibited the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of all but 2 proteins. Ten insulin-stimulated phosphoproteins were wortmannin-sensitive and PDGF-insensitive, and were selected as potential candidates for involvement in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. The molecular identity of insulin-stimulated phosphoproteins were initially examined by immunoblotting. Two cytosolic 2D gel spots (C65 and C79) were identified as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) isoforms by immunoblotting. Importantly, treatment-induced changes in the phosphorylation of these spots matched those reported for MAPK in adipocytes, confirming that our phosphoprotein mapping accurately reflects cellular phosphorylation. As the observed molecular mass and isoelectric point (pI) of most insulin-regulated phosphoproteins did not match known insulin-signalling proteins, we attempted to identify these by protein sequencing. In agreement with the low abundance of signalling proteins, most of the insulin-regulated phosphoprotein spots were not Coomassie-stained, even on preparative 2D gels. Thus, corresponding spots were pooled from numerous preparative 2D gels, before tryptic digestion and anlaysis by liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS). One of the more abundant candidate phosphoproteins was identified as ATP-citrate lyase (ACL), an enzyme involved in fatty acid synthesis previously shown to be an insulin-regulated phosphoprotein. Insulin treatment also results in the dephosphorylation of several phosphoproteins, one of which was identified as eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 (eEF2). ACL and eEF2 phosphorylation were found to be regulated in an insulin-specific and wortmannin-sensitive manner in adipocytes. Recent studies suggest that protein kinase B (PKB) is activated downstream of PI3K, and participates in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. However, the molecular mass and pI of phosphoproteins mapped in this study did not match any of the known PKB isoforms. To investigate the regulation of PKB isoform in adipocytes, studies were performed with PKB antibodies. PKBb expression was found to be induced upon differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes, where insulin, but not PDGF stimulated its phosphorylation. In contrast, PKBa expression was high in fibroblasts, where PDGF was more efficacious than insulin in inducing its phosphorylation. These results suggest that PKBb, rather than PKBa, is the most pertinent isoform for insulin action in adipocytes. PDGF exerted no detectable effect on the phosphorylation of PKBb in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, as determined by phospho-specific antibodies, 32P-labelling and shifts in electrophoretic mobility and pI. Furthermore, insulin stimulated the translocation of PKBb to membrane fractions of adipocytes, whereas PDGF was without effect. Together, these results strongly suggest that PDGF does not activate PKBb in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Using 2-DE, we have obtained data which support the hypothesis that insulin stimulates an unique signalling pathway in adipocytes. Three potential models are proposed to explain the insulin specificity: targeting of PI3K to pre-assembled signalling complexes in the HSP, activation of specific PI3K isoforms, and activation of two PI3K-dependent signalling pathways. These models remain to be validated in future studies. Candidate phosphoproteins for insulin regulation of glucose metabolism have been mapped using 2-DE. While only abundant metabolic enzymes have been identified so far, methods for phosphoprotein purification and identification have been established. The candidate phosphoproteins mapped in the HSP fraction are likely to be low abundance signalling proteins, and further preparative isolation of these phosphoproteins is required in order to obtain enough protein for identification of these candidates. In conclusion, the present study has demonstrated the successful application of proteomic techniques in cell signalling research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">insulin</field><field name="subject">signalling</field><field name="subject">diabetes</field><field name="subject">proteomics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The early development of the health services of Papua New Guinea, 1870-1939</field><field name="creator">Spencer, Dora Margaret</field><field name="description">This is an account of the two administration health services, and of those provided by the missions, through three succeeding regimes in British New Guinea/Papua and four successive regimes in German New Guinea/Territory of New Guinea. It also traces the evolution of Australian health administration in relation to the health services of Papua and New Guinea. Because the missions - although subsidised by the Administrations - developed medical services of their own before and quite separate from the administration services they are considered separately. Development of the health services was affected by the considerable constraints of insufficient finance, unfamiliar terrain, unfamiliar peoples and unfamiliar diseases. It was also affected by the emergencies of recurring epidemics of introduced diseases, by the interruption of the First World War and by the crisis of the Great Depression years. While in spite of the war years development was more or less continuous in Papua, New Guinea suffered almost complete disruption of health services for seven years, except to military personnel, during the years of occupation by Australian troops between 1914 and 1921. Nonetheless before the 1930s both the Papua and New Guinea health services were stable and expanding. Increasingly they were able to retain medical staff and to send officers to Australia for postgraduate training in tropical medicine and hygiene: also to undertake increasing medical training and dispersal of both European Medical Assistants and indigenous personnel on patrols and into village societies. The importance of adequate nutrition became a central issue, and continuing campaigns were conducted against hookworm, yaws, gonorrhoea and leprosy. The period of eighteen years between the establishment of Australia's Commonwealth Department of Health in 1921 and 1939 included an exploration of Australia's potential role in relation to health matters in Papua and New Guinea and more widely in the Pacific Region. The first, and a significant, contribution was that made by the Commonwealth Health Laboratory in Rabaul. As possibilities were explored and tried, or discarded, it became clear that the best means for Australia to assist in the health problems of the two Territories was by providing appropriate training for medical and other health personnel and for missionaries, and by conducting field surveys and research to help elucidate the epidemiology and pathology of diseases and questions of entomology. Other appropriate action was the initiation and conducting of international conferences on health matters of common concern, and the undertaking of the receipt and distribution of epidemiological intelligence for the Austral-Pacific Zone, of which New Guinea was a part. The period of the study ends in 1939, when the inevitability of war, and the likely inclusion of New Guinea in the conflict, became apparent.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Early Development</field><field name="subject">Health Services</field><field name="subject">Papua New Guinea</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157909</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resource Centre Sites: The New Gatekeepers of the Web?</field><field name="creator">Bruns, Axel</field><field name="description">This thesis introduces and analyses the emerging Website genre of Resource Centre Sites. RCSs are sites which combine news, rumours and background information as well as community discussion and commentary on their chosen topic, and frequently serve as a first point of entry for readers interested in learning more about the field. They also offer spaces for virtual communities of specialists or enthusiasts to emerge, who in the process and as a product of their interaction on these sites collate detailed resource collections and hyperlink directories for their fields of interest. Therefore, Resource Centre Sites significantly involve their users as content contributors and producers, turning them into what is here termed &#145;produsers&#146; of the site. Aiming to evaluate all the content relevant to their field that is becoming available online, and to coopt or at least link to this information from the news and resources collection that is a central part of the RCS, Resource Centre Site produsers engage in an adaptation of both traditional journalistic gatekeeping methodologies and librarianly resource collection approaches to the Web environment: in the absence of gates to keep online, they have become &#145;gatewatchers&#146;, observing the publication of news and information in other sources and publicising its existence through their own sites. Their operation is studied here through a number of case studies of major existing Resource Centre Sites from various fields of interest. These sites are analysed both based on their available Web content, and using background information obtained in a series of email interviews with RCS creators. In combination, this offers insights into the operating philosophies of sites and site editors, and provides an opportunity to assess to what extent these ideas have been translated into everyday practice. Chapter 1 provides an overview of past and current theoretical views of the Web in an effort to evaluate their suitability for the current study. Older approaches positing an abstract &#145;ideal&#146; form of hypertext are rejected in favour of a direct engagement with the World Wide Web as the now dominant mode of hypertextuality. Chapter 2 outlines the principles of gatewatching in contrast to traditional methods of evaluating news and information as they exist in journalistic media and archival institutions, and investigates the effects such gatewatching practices may have on editors and users. Chapter 3 describes the overall characteristics of Resource Centre Sites as a genre of Web publications. It notes the special role site users play in the operation of such sites (in their new role as &#145;produsers&#146;), and distinguishes the RCS genre from similar Website models such as portals and cybermediaries. Chapter 4 observes the everyday operation of such Websites in practice, using case studies of major existing Resource Centre Sites including Slashdot, MediaChannel and CountingDown, and interviews with their creators.

This analysis works with both a synchronic view to the variety of topics existing Resource Centre Sites are able to address, and a diachronic view to the evolution of proto-RCSs (such as enthusiast community or online advocacy sites) into fully-featured Resource Centre Sites.

The sulphide mineral chalcopyrite is the most common copper mineral in the world, comprising the bulk of the known copper reserves. Chalcopyrite is resistant to bacterial leaching and despite research over the last 20-30 years, has not yet been economically bioleached. Attempts have been made to use silver to catalyse the bacterial leaching of chalcopyrite since the early seventies. The majority of reported testwork had been performed on finely ground ore and concentrates in agitated batch reactors. This project used silver to catalyse the bioleaching of chalcopyrite in shake flasks, small columns and large columns. The catalytic effect was extensively studied and experimental parameters were varied to maximise copper recovery. Silver was also used to catalyse the ferric leaching of chalcopyrite at elevated temperatures. It was noted that the leaching performance of chalcopyrite in shake flasks compared to columns was markedly different. The specific differences between shake flasks and columns were qualified and separately tested to determine which parameter(s) affected the bioleaching of chalcopyrite. It was found that the ore to solution ratio, aeration, addition of carbon dioxide, solution distribution and small variations in the leaching temperature did not significantly effect the bioleaching of chalcopyrite ore in columns. The method of silver addition to columns did significantly affect the overall copper extraction. The ore in shake flasks was subjected to abrasion between ore particles and with the base of the flask. A test was designed to mimic the shake flask conditions, without the abrasion. The low abrasion test performed similarly to a column, operated with optimum silver addition. This indicated that the inherent equipment difference between shake flask and column operation largely accounted for the difference in leaching performance. Chalcopyrite ore was biologically leached in large columns. The ore crush size and other conditions were typical of those used in the field. The biological leach achieved 65% copper extraction in 160 days. This level of copper extraction is significantly higher than any previously reported results (typically /10% copper extraction) and represents a significant advance in the bacterial leaching of chalcopyrite ore. Due to the inherent high temperature within underground stopes, it was decided to investigate the possibility of separating the leaching and the bacterial oxidation stages. The concept of separate bacterial and ferric leaching has been previously suggested, however the application to a stope, and heat exchange between the process streams was a novel approach. Large column ferric leaches at 70 oC illustrated the technical feasibility of this process. Copper extraction was rapid and high (70% in 100 days of leaching), even when a reduced level of silver catalysis was used. After leaching in large columns, samples of ore were taken for analysis by optical mineralogy. The analysis gave valuable insights into the nature of reaction passivation on chalcopyrite ore. In particular, it was discovered that the precipitation of goethite was a major limiting factor in the bioleaching and ferric leaching of chalcopyrite in columns. In addition, reduced sulphide species were detected on the surface of residual chalcopyrite, giving an indication of the sequential nature of the chalcopyrite reaction chemistry. The bacterial population was characterised using DNA techniques developed during the project. Qualitative speciation was carried out and compared between the columns, down the columns and over time in a column. Comparison of these populations enabled greater mechanistic understanding of the role of bacteria in the leaching of chalcopyrite. This work was the most comprehensive attempt to date made to delineate the complex microbiological/mineral actions using analysis of population dynamics from a mixed inoculum. It was found that the iron oxidiser Thiobacillus ferrooxidans dominated within the columns and leach solutions. The sulphur oxidiser Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans was also prevalent in the columns, particularly during the period of rapid chalcopyrite oxidation. The high temperature, ferric leaching of chalcopyrite was unexpectedly poor in the first round of large columns. The reason for the low extraction was attributed to an increase in pH down the column, resulting in excessive goethite precipitation. The solution flowrate (velocity) was increased by ten times in subsequent columns. There were no operational problems (e.g. break-up of ore agglomerates). The increase in flowrate resulted in a high yield of copper. The kinetics of extraction were faster than a corresponding bacterial leach, confirming the potential advantage of a high temperature leach. The small column studies highlighted that it was important to get an even distribution of silver down the stope to enable maximum catalytic effect. If the ore were agglomerated, silver would be added with acid at that point. However, it may not always be possible to agglomerate the ore. For example, the process may be used in-situ on a fractured ore body, or on an ore that has a low fines content, and hence does not require agglomeration. Various complexing agents were tested for their ability to distribute silver at the start of the leach and to recover silver at the end of the leach. For instance when silver was complexed with thiourea and then trickled through the ore, an even distribution of silver was achieved. After leaching was completed, a thiourea wash recovered a significant amount of the silver. These two techniques minimised the amount of silver required and thus significantly added to the economic viability of the process. The success of the technical work has led to an evaluation of the process in the field. A flowsheet was developed for the high temperature, in-stope ferric leach of chalcopyrite. An economic analysis was performed that illustrated the process would be viable in certain situations. An engineering study considered issues such as acid consumption, aeration, silver distribution, silver recovery and a heat balance of the stope.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chalcopyrite</field><field name="subject">bioleach</field><field name="subject">heap</field><field name="subject">copper</field><field name="subject">supfide</field><field name="subject">sulphide</field><field name="subject">silver</field><field name="subject">catalysis</field><field name="subject">column</field><field name="subject">stope</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157908</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the use of the bispectrum to detect and model non-linearity</field><field name="creator">Barnett, Adrian Gerard</field><field name="description">Informally a discrete time series is a set of repeated and, normally, equally spaced observations from the same process over time. The statistical analysis of time series has two functions: to understand better the generating process underlying the time series, and to forecast future values. The first analytical methods developed were based upon linear series. A linear series can be represented as a linear function of its own past and current values and the past and current values of some noise process, which can be interpreted as the innovations to the system. A non-linear series has a generally more complex structure that depends upon non-linear interactions between its past and current values and the sequence of innovations. Existing linear statistical methods can only approximate non-linear series. As there is evidence to show that non-linear series are common in real life, two important problems are to detect and then to classify non-linearity. In moving from a linear to a non-linear structure the choice of possible models has moved from a countably infinite to an uncountably infinite set. Hence the need for methods that not only detect non-linearity, but classify the non-linear relationship between the past and current values and innovations. The third order moment is the expectation of the product of three series values lagged in time. The bispectrum is the double Fourier transform of the third order moment. Both statistics are useful tools for eliciting information on non-linear time series. There are concerns with the assumption of asymptotic independence between the values of the bispectrum estimate used by an existing test of non-linearity. We develop a method with a greater power than this existing method to detect non-linear series by using a model-based bootstrap. Further we show how patterns in the bispectrum are useful for classifying the locations of the non-linear interactions. To understand better tests of non-linearity and related inference, we investigate the variance of two estimates of the bispectrum. The two estimates are shown to have different inferential properties. One estimate is generally better able than the other to detect non-linearity and give information on the location of the non-linear interactions. The third order moment is statistically equivalent to the bispectrum. A particular estimate of the bispectrum is the double Fourier transform of all the estimated third order moment values in a specified region. When using the third order moment to test for non-linearity we can examine any subset of these values in the specified region. Hence an advantage to using the third order moment, instead of the bispectrum, when testing for non-linearity is a greater flexibility in the range of values selected. We show an improved test for non-linearity over the bispectrum-based test, using a reduced set of the third order moment and a phase scrambling-based bootstrap. Time series can often be observed in a multiple or repeated form, such as the exchange rate between a set of currencies. There is then interest in summarising the common features of the grouped series. An existing linear method based on the spectrum assumes that an observed series (within a population) can be described as a common population spectrum perturbed by an individual effect. The observational noise in the spectrum is modelled using the known asymptotic properties of the spectral estimate. By modelling (and then removing) the individual effects and noise, the method summarises the population linear characteristics through the spectrum. We modify and then extend this method to summarise the common features of the underlying non-linear generating process of a set of repeated time series using the bispectrum normalised by the spectrum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">time series</field><field name="subject">non-linear</field><field name="subject">bispectrum</field><field name="subject">longitudinal data</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157906</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microeconomic reform of wholesale power markets: a dynamic partial equilibrium analysis of the impact of restructuring and deregulation in Queensland</field><field name="creator">Simshauser, Paul Edward</field><field name="description">This dissertation assesses the evolving structure and performance of the electricity supply industry (ESI) in Queensland following the restructuring and deregulation process undertaken in 1997 and 1998 respectively. This microeconomic reform process essentially replaced a vertically integrated electricity monopoly with an oligopolistic electricity market. In theory at least, restructuring a monopoly generator, and deregulating the product and capacity markets, should lead to lower electricity production costs, more cost-reflective wholesale electricity prices, and a generation plant expansion path that reflects the least-cost, optimal mix of baseload, intermediate and peaking technologies. In economic terms, the deregulated electricity market should deliver improvements in productive, allocative and dynamic efficiency. However, a likely side effect is a deterioration of ESI environmental performance, since the minimization of production costs are of paramount importance in a competitive market. This research has utilized historic data, direct comparisons to southern market outcomes, economic theory and the development and adaptation of a suite of economic cost and generation system simulation models to test the stated hypotheses of expected improvements in productive, allocative and dynamic efficiency, and a deterioration in environmental performance. This research has not had the availability of extensive historical market data upon which to draw. When research first commenced, less than six months of historical market data were available. At the time of completion of this dissertation, only three full financial years of data existed. Consequently, this research necessarily relied upon complex simulation models of economic cost and electricity generation systems, coupled with economic theory, to forecast market outcomes. The short history of market data is examined and tentative conclusions are drawn from this, which are integrated with the outputs of the simulation models. Simulation experiments have been conducted to identify the theoretically optimal market outcome, that is, the least-cost generation plant mix that would best meet the Queensland load curve, subject to a reliability constraint. This forms the 'base case', and represents that which would reasonably be expected to emerge under a centrally planned monopoly regime with a welfare maximization objective, characterised by perfect information and zero political intervention. Such a scenario establishes efficient generation system costs, prices and plant capacity mix. The 'base case' or centrally planned scenario is contrasted with forecast 'market scenarios'. Performance of the generation system is explored under specified scenarios using the economic cost and generation system simulation models, publicly available information about committed and expected future investment in plant capacity, incumbent generator trends and behavioural assumptions consistent with oligopolistic market theories. The analysis indicates that productive efficiency, or cost efficiency, is enhanced as a result of restructuring the monopoly generator into competing entities since competitive pressures force the generators to reduce costs in order to survive. Allocative efficiency, or price efficiency, declined during the first three years of the market, with all generators earning positive economic rents. The presence of these economic rents, coupled with conventional oligopolistic strategies associated with the theory of barriers to entry, resulted in a rush to commission new baseload capacity. Not surprisingly, dynamic efficiency appears to be deteriorating, with the market-induced capacity augmentation proving to be far greater than that considered optimal. Modelling results indicate that the oversupply of baseload capacity is expected to place considerable downward pressure on electricity prices, and thus allocative efficiency is forecast to improve in the intermediate run, much to the benefit of electricity consumers. In the long run, the oversupply of baseload capacity and subsequent low market price can be expected to frustrate the timely entry of new peaking or intermediate plant capacity, which will ultimately be required by the Queensland ESI given the strong electricity demand growth. What does appear to be emerging is a five or seven year electricity generation business cycle. Modelling results from this research also point to alarming environmental implications, with the general levels of greenhouse gas emissions of the electricity system increasing. While system thermal efficiency is declining, the rush of new, low-cost coal-fired capacity represents an inferior outcome to the alternative (i.e. efficient combined cycle gas plant) because the volume of greenhouse emissions is markedly higher. The outlook for Queensland's greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation, in the absence of coincident environmental policies, is that they will more than double between the 1990 emission baseline, and the commencement of the Kyoto commitment period in 2008. Some clear warnings emerge from this research. The structure and performance of an ESI prior to deregulation is important if microeconomic reforms are to be successful. Too little generation capacity or transmission capacity is unlikely to provide a robust foundation for wholesale market implementation. To ensure that adequate competition will prevail, it will be necessary to restructure monopoly generators. The existing ESI needs to be characterised by &#145;inefficiency&#146; if gains from trade are to be capitalized. An efficient centrally planned ESI is unlikely to benefit greatly from deregulation, particularly given that implementing a product market is likely to be a costly process. And finally, competitive markets deliver lowest cost, which is usually inconsistent with the most environmentally responsible outcome. As a result, if the environment is considered a policy imperative, it will be critical that ESI deregulation be complemented by coincident environmental regulations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">electricity industry</field><field name="subject">electricity generation</field><field name="subject">electricity spot markets</field><field name="subject">generation plant mix</field><field name="subject">barriers to entry</field><field name="subject">microeconomic reform</field><field name="subject">deregulation</field><field name="subject">greenhouse gas emissions</field><field name="subject">electricity policy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Economic efficiency in the provision of local public goods</field><field name="creator">Worthington, Andrew Charles</field><field name="description">This study of local public sector efficiency, the first attempted in an Australian context using frontier measurement techniques, seeks to survey and estimate the level and determinants of productive, allocative, technical and scale efficiency in Australian local government. It finds that a major influence on efficiency in local government is the imposed contextual environment, that efficiency varies markedly across particular local governments, and that productive efficiency in the provision of local public services has improved during the recent program of microeconomic reform. The first theoretical section of the study examines the econometric and mathematical methods that have been employed in the recent history of efficiency measurement. Starting with an assessment of the significance of Farrell's (1957) pioneering work on the analysis of productive efficiency, it extends this approach to the orthodox analysis of deterministic frontiers, and discusses the ongoing analysis of stochastic frontiers. The theoretical section also examines the alternative mathematical programming approach to the analysis of productive efficiency, as well as examining some extensions to this approach. The section concludes with a discussion of various theoretical issues involved in selecting an appropriate analytical technique and interpreting the resultant findings. The second section of the study contains a comprehensive survey of empirical work on frontier efficiency measurement techniques. It examines various applications using microeconomic efficiency methods in the fields of financial services, healthcare, education, local public services, and other selected applications. Attention is paid to the preferred analytical techniques used in each field, especially those concerning input/output specification. The main finding of this section is that the nature of the sample itself often requires careful analysis, especially as institutional and environmental factors can exert a strong influence on efficiency measures. The third section of the study provides a brief overview of local government in Australia, with particular emphasis on internationally distinguishable characteristics. The function and financing of Australian local government is discussed, with special attention paid to the state of New South Wales. The institutional section also examines the progress of microeconomic reform in Australian local government, and discusses the extant approaches to comparative performance measurement and process benchmarking. The final section of the study is concerned with a contemporary empirical evaluation of local public sector efficiency in Australia. The analysis is not only the first undertaken in Australia using frontier measurement techniques, but this is also the only study to simultaneously evaluate efficiency in a number of different local government functions, across both jurisdictions and time. The results indicate that allocative inefficiency, rather than technical inefficiency, represents the main source of productive inefficiency in local government, and that technical inefficiency is largely the result of scale inefficiencies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Technical</field><field name="subject">Allocative</field><field name="subject">Scale</field><field name="subject">Efficiency</field><field name="subject">Local Government</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157903</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical Methods in Reaction Rate Theory</field><field name="creator">Frankcombe, Terry James</field><field name="description">Numerical methods are often required to solve chemical problems, either to verify theoretical models or to access information that is not readily available experimentally.

Using specific case-studies, this thesis argues that young people and youth-specific performance are being represented, positioned, and valued in a variety of contradictory ways as a result of a number of significant contemporary factors: namely, a prevalence of 'new generation' discourse and an attendant generationalism, a growing critical recognition of young people's 'grounded aesthetics', and existing anxieties surrounding the economic future of Australia's arts industry. This is an unstable situation for youth-specific performance, contrasting from earlier periods in Australia's theatre history when young people were positioned principally in terms of their need for 'development' (education and training) or their potential contribution to ongoing 'progression'. This thesis considers this contemporary situation in relation to issues of access and power for young people in the changed social and cultural conditions of the 1990s. The introductory chapter provides a critical background to the main issues presented in the thesis: the concepts of 'youth' and 'culture', the social and cultural characteristics of young people's lives in the 1990s, the rise of generationalist discourse, and the anxious state of the Australian arts industry. The 'institutional' site of state theatre is then taken as a beginning case study to examine the positioning of young people and youth-specific programs in 'official' cultural environments. It argues that anxious plans for the future survival of state 'flagship' companies are positioning young people and youth-specific programs in predominantly generationalist ways, using 'new generation' discourse to mask often conservative approaches. Chapter One begins with a history of Magpie Theatre (a former youth-specific company attached to the State Theatre Company of South Australia) which reflects some of the major priorities of youth-specific theatre of the last twenty years. By way of contrast, the Sydney Theatre Company's recent attempts to reposition young people and youth-specific work in the 1990s are discussed in Chapter Two. This chapter shows how the company's developmental aims and processing of new work are achieved in 'new generation' programs that strictly control young people's contribution to the company's future. Both chapters help to demonstrate the main conceptual shift in youth-specific theatre in the 1990s from 'developmentalism' to 'difference' (with reference to the concomitant growth of drama-in-education in schools), while at the same time alluding to its varying effect. Chapter Three argues that festivals, as volatile sites of cultural production, magnify the wider cultural field's 'stake of struggles': particularly, the struggles to equitably value young people's diverse contributions to developments in the cultural field, both as cultural 'innovators' and cultural 'preservers'. Centred on an interrelated critique of access, this chapter discusses the various motives and priorities of three recent youth-specific arts festivals in terms of their representation and valuing of young people and their work: the Take Over 97 National Festival for Young People, the Stage X Event, and the Loud National Media Festival of Youth Culture and the Arts. Chapter Four considers a site primarily and explicitly concerned with issues of access, representation, and value. This chapter examines in detail the 'self-narratives' of two youth-specific community-based performances, whereby young people's access to 'grounded' modes of cultural expression resulted in innovative cultural performance and signalled a regenerated social politics of community theatre. The chapter examines how Skate Girl Space by the Hereford Sisters and Zen Che by the Ningi Connection utilised young people's 'grounded aesthetics' of video performance to address young people's necessary negotiation with risk and individualisation in the late 1990s. Both projects counteracted public generationalist discourses, and challenged and reinscribed the conventions of gender performance and 'youth'. The final chapter considers the positioning of young people and youth-specific arts in Australian cultural policy, arguing that youth-specific cultural production rarely fits into the characteristic modes of arts production valorised by statistical frameworks for arts industry evaluation. The chapter calls for more open approaches whereby practice might inform policy which recognises the interconnected social, cultural and economic regimes of value that youth-specific work engages in. This thesis draws from theatre and performance studies, sociology, youth studies, cultural studies, and cultural policy studies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">youth</field><field name="subject">youth theatre</field><field name="subject">young people's theatre</field><field name="subject">Australian theatre</field><field name="subject">community theatre</field><field name="subject">young people and performance</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157901</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Habermas and critique : theoretical bases of a radical social democratic politics</field><field name="creator">Leet, Martin Ronald</field><field name="description">This dissertation aims to evaluate the philosophy of J&#252;rgen Habermas with reference to the arguments it provides for a theory of radical social democratic politics. Habermas is a German philosopher and social theorist whose broad concern is the defence and elaboration of the 'project of modernity'. This means that he wishes to justify modern, developed societies as viable and worthwhile forms of civilization. He attempts to specify and redeem the claim that these societies represent, potentially, the most advanced and rational way of organizing human life. Habermas is committed, among the various political programs which raise this kind of claim and seek to realize it in practice, to a form of radical social democracy. This tradition of theory and practice pursues the task of human emancipation by means of fundamental reforms to the social, cultural, economic and political institutions of contemporary modern societies. Habermas' work can be understood as one of the most systematic contributions to this tradition. The central question guiding the dissertation concerns the theoretical and political adequacy of this contribution. The dissertation establishes two general criteria for evaluating Habermas' work. The first criterion requires identifying the normative foundations of social democratic politics. It is argued that a 'theory of the rational' is needed to satisfy this. Such a theory must demonstrate that the social structures and political institutions of the modern epoch represent an hitherto unprecedented opportunity for the expression of the human capacity for rationality. The exposition of normative grounds for social democratic politics determines the basis for social criticism and political struggle. A theory of the rational, in other words, informs us of why we are struggling. Nonetheless, such a theory, on its own, cannot provide guidance about how to struggle. The second criterion of evaluation relates to this question of 'how', of what theoretical direction can be given to political practice. The dissertation contends, in this regard, that a 'theory of the irrational' is necessary. It is argued that a theory of the irrational offers a framework for orienting social movements in struggles against those obstacles which stand in the way of a further expansion of rationality. Such a theory seeks to understand the irrationality of human life in an effort to recommend political strategies that can intervene prudently in the current state of affairs. It is maintained that a satisfactory construction of both theories is essential for an adequate comprehension of radical social democratic politics. The dissertation pursues this argument by clarifying the nature of three dimensions of 'critique' within Habermas' oeuvre. Conceptions of critique represent methodological frameworks for formulating theories of the rational and the irrational. Habermas deploys these methods of critique throughout his work. It is argued, however, that his application of critique focuses primarily on providing a theory of the rational. The central thesis is that while he offers the rudiments of a theory of the irrational, this theory is underdeveloped. Since this theory addresses the question of how social movements are to struggle, it is argued that Habermas' approach lacks a practical dimension. The dissertation concludes that his contribution in this regard needs to be elaborated more consistently and in more detail. The dissertation represents an internal analysis of Habermas' work. It seeks to ascertain whether his theory achieves the philosophical and political goals required by the tradition of thought to which it belongs. The dissertation contributes to the critical literature on Habermas' writings in three substantial ways. First, it establishes a framework for understanding how the separate elements of his theory fit together. The identification of general criteria with respect to which a theory of social democracy is to be evaluated means that the political purposes of these various elements can be understood more clearly. The tensions between them can also be illustrated. Second, with the help of this framework, the dissertation expands upon and sharpens longstanding criticisms of Habermas' thinking which have pointed to a missing practical dimension. Third, the dissertation identifies theoretical resources, elaborated by Habermas himself, which it is argued can be used to overcome these problems of impracticality. With this, the dissertation also contributes, in a more indirect way, to the current debate about the meaning of and possibilities for social democratic politics.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Habermas</field><field name="subject">Critical Theory</field><field name="subject">Social Democracy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157899</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EFL teachers in context : beliefs, practices and interactions</field><field name="creator">Sato, Kazuyoshi</field><field name="description">This study aims at revealing the school culture and its professional development activities. In essence, it attempts to reveal the relationships among the context, teachers&#145; beliefs, practices, and interactions. Little is documented as to how inservice teachers perceive English language teaching, how they actually teach, how they interact with colleagues, and how they continue to learn to teach in a Japanese learning environment. Using multiple data sources including interviews, observations, surveys, and documents of teachers in an English department, this yearlong study revealed that experiencing new teaching practices in classrooms was not sufficient for teacher learning toward professional development to occur in the school and department context. The teaching culture of this school was consistent and almost immutable throughout the study. Responses from these teachers revealed at least three rules for this particular teaching culture: (1) Managing students and managing various work took precedence over teaching; (2) Communication and collaboration centered on keeping pace with others and getting through the day, rather than solving teaching issues; (3) It was particularly important to teach the same way for the common test and to maintain classroom management. The teaching culture of this school was defined and sustained by teachers&#146; beliefs. As teachers worked together in this school culture, they identified with one another and shared the same beliefs about school norms and values, the subject matter, students, and other work. Thus, individual teachers prioritized their educational beliefs over any beliefs they may have brought to the context. Consequently, these teachers reinforced their beliefs, existing practices, and internal interactions in this school context. The study revealed that these EFL (English as a foreign language) teachers lacked many teacher learning opportunities in their context. Although the majority of teachers replied that they learned how to teach by watching other teachers in this school context, there had been only a few peer-observations throughout the yearlong study. Experienced teachers were reluctant to have their classes observed and critiqued, while young teachers socialized themselves to the norm of teaching as other experienced teachers did. It was evident that a few peer-observations only helped these young teachers master routine practices. In addition, experienced teachers reported that they had been teaching the same way based on their second language (L2) learning and initial teaching experiences. As long as they teach the same way according to the existing curriculum, they do not seem to need any new ideas. In fact, a majority of teachers continued to avoid attending workshops outside the school. In contrast, only a few teachers tried out new ideas, and then mainly in special classes. However, those teaching experiences were little reported or shared, and innovation remained marginalized in this school and department context. As a result, individual trial and error generated few teacher learning opportunities for professional development in this school and department context. The study described the teaching culture through comprehensive investigation of the relationships among context, beliefs, practices, and interactions. The study revealed the context-specific nature of beliefs, which prioritized managing students and various kinds of work over teaching the subject in this school context. As long as teachers maintain such beliefs, they choose not to participate in many teacher learning opportunities in this context. This study calls for reconceptualization of teacher development in school contexts. Future questions remain as to how teachers can be life-long learners in their workplace.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">beliefs</field><field name="subject">practices</field><field name="subject">interactions</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157898</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanised Intercropping and Double Cropping in Southern Queensland</field><field name="creator">Peter Michael Masasso</field><field name="description">The potential for relay intercropping and double cropping was assessed in field trials over three consecutive years at Gatton, Queensland. The rationale was to use controlled traffic technology to facilitate relay and double cropping and thus research a cropping system that could exploit late winter crop rainfall. In Field Trial I, grain sorghum and sunflower, broadacre crops already grown within the Southern and Darling Downs regions of Queensland and New South Wales were intercropped into wheat; sunflower was intercropped with wheat in Field Trial II. Sole summer plantings were made at the same time as intercrops were planted. The wheat crop was cut and stubble removed to facilitate this. Various planting dates (three for Field Trial I; four for Field Trial II) for the relayed summer crops were used to determine if an optimum planting time existed. Plant height, tiller number, light interception, grain yield, soil moisture and economic return were used as parameters to compare the intercrop with sole plantings in Field Trial I. Grain yield, soil moisture, rainfall infiltration and economic return were measured in Field Trial II. Research also involved the modification and testing of a tractor to carry out the sowing of the intercrop. In Field Trial I, light interception was shown to vary at different stages of the wheat crop and the use of these stages to determine optimum planting dates of the relay crop is suggested. In both trials, no differences were recorded in the grain yield between intercropped and sole cropped wheat treatments suggesting the trafficking of the plot did not affect the wheat. As neither sorghum or sunflower established as intercrops, competition was not a factor in affecting wheat yields. Moisture readings in both trials showed little change below a depth of 100 cm; however some treatment differences were present at shallower depths. In Field ii Trial I, sole summer sorghum, especially the first planting date, showed reduced water capture/ higher soil evaporation due to wheat removal initially and later transpiration loss due to crop growth and increased weed pressure. Sole wheat treatments showed increased moisture storage after harvest due to lack of water use by the crop and increased infiltration/reduced runoff due to stubble retention. Improved soil moisture recharge after rainfall events was apparent in double cropped treatments suggesting not only improved water utilisation but also improved capture and storage is possible within this system. Sorghum, commonly used throughout south eastern Queensland as a summer crop option, proved unsuitable for relay intercropping in Field Trial I for Planting Dates 1 and 2. Minimum soil temperatures for these plantings were marginal as they were close to the 15o Celsius level recommended for sorghum. However, even though establishment was poor for the intercropped plantings, it was higher for sole sorghum plantings. Wheat allelopathic effects may be involved. To avoid the temperature limitations of sorghum, sunflower was selected as an alternative intercrop in the later planting dates of Field Trial I and all dates for Field Trial II. Reasons for the poor establishment and yield of sunflowers in the earlier intercrop planting dates compared to sole plantings remain unknown but also may be related to allelopathic effects from intercropped wheat. Low soil temperature was not a factor affecting establishment Yields for planting dates were recorded in the intercropped sunflower treatments for Field Trial II and the optimal planting time for sunflowers in a wheat/sunflower relay intercrop was identified as when physiological maturity of the wheat had occurred. This may relate to the wheat crop stage. In Field Trial II, no significant differences in soil moisture were recorded between treatments from overall water use for the trial period. There were differences in water use between intercropped and sole cropped treatments for iii some rainfall events. Three rainfall events were chosen for closer study in each of the field trials conducted. Each event varied in the length and time as well as the duration and intensity of the rain that fell for the period. For the first rainfall period the moisture content of the first planting date of the sole summer treatment and to a lesser extent the second planting date of the same treatment increased, most likely due to wheat removal. In the third rainfall period the double cropped sunflower treatment with stubble tended to store less moisture and this may be due to the active crop growth at this time. It was evident in both field trials of the need for an effective weed control program in the intercrop plots. Weeds were controlled in wheel tracks by glyphosate sprays. Cultural methods may help but a herbicide suitable for both components of the intercrop would be very useful. A tractor was successfully modified to a 3 metre wheelspace and a clearance of 70 cm. This proved sufficient for planting the relay intercrop in Field Trial II without negatively affecting the yield of the standing crop. The row spacing of 18 cm for wheat in a 3 metre fixed bed and wheeltrack configuration assisted with guidance and interplanting of the relay crop. The relay crop was sown as single alternating rows.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">relay intercropping, controlled traffic, wheat, sunflower, sorghum, LER, ATER, CPR, tramlining, reaised beds</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159371</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constructions of literacy assessment in two year 8 English classrooms</field><field name="creator">Moni, Karen Bradshaw</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT This research project had three aims. The first was to investigate the culture of literacy assessment in English classrooms during the first year of high school. The second aim was to examine the interplay of elements of classroom-based literacy assessment including: the use of alternative assessment methods, tasks, and practices; the influence of principles of literacy assessment, discourses related to literacy assessment, and teacher-student interactions in classrooms. A third aim was to develop an understanding of the perceptions of the participants related to literacy assessment during one school year. Two studies were undertaken to achieve these aims. The preliminary study surveyed Year 8 English teachers in Queensland, Australia about their perceptions and practices of literacy assessment. The survey composed of open and closed questions was sent to 100 state high schools. Data from the 120 returned surveys were analysed using quantitative and qualitative techniques. The main findings from the survey were that Year 8 teachers knew little about their students' previous experiences of literacy assessment. Teachers perceived that students needed to understand the assessment program in high school. However, teachers recognised that students faced difficulties in dealing with new regimes of assessment. While teachers were positive about their assessment programs, they were also concerned about their lack of expertise in assessment and their recording procedures. Tensions between teachers' expectations of their students and their values and practices suggested that a further exploration of literacy assessment was required in classroom settings. This exploration was undertaken in the main study. The main study comprised a detailed investigation of literacy assessment in two Year 8 English classrooms using a longitudinal, qualitative research design. Data were collected systematically from multiple sources, numerous times throughout one school year. Data gathering methods included observations, interviews, document collection, videotaping, ranking activities, and collecting participants' accounts of literacy assessment events. A range of qualitative analysis techniques was applied to each form of data. The main study found that while teachers had some autonomy in assessment, they were also constrained by the requirements of assessment programs outlined in syllabus documents. In these programs, teachers are responsible for the development, implementation and marking of up to ten assessment tasks during the year. An analysis of teachers' programs and practices identified task sheets as key assessment texts. They were used in multiple ways by the teachers and their students. Students' understandings about task sheets varied, their comprehension of task sheets was limited, and they understood less than their teachers expected. The pedagogy of literacy assessment was dominated by implicit teaching and centred on completing assessment tasks. The teachers adopted authoritative positions in assessment talk and there were limited opportunities for students to participate in the assessment process. In talk around assessment, students were introduced to institutionalised ways of valuing and doing assessment. Teachers' detailed explanations of tasks had limited effects on students' learning, and during the year there was increasing student resistance to these explanations. The teachers' and their students' understandings of tasks and assessment were incongruent. However, the teachers and students did share a focus on assessment as a goal in itself. Purposes for completing tasks such as developing new literacy skills were not evident in participants' accounts. Although the first aim of the study was to investigate the culture of assessment, multiple cultures of assessment were identified. The study also concluded that in these classrooms there were multiple discourses related to assessment which were co-constructed by teachers and students during assessment related activities. These discourses were not always shared and were understood in different ways by the teachers and students. Implications were drawn from these findings about directions for future research including: broadening the research to other contexts, continuing investigations of classroom-based assessment theory and practice, and further longitudinal studies of students' perceptions. Implications for practice focused on re-examining the purposes and focus of assessment in the first year of high school, increasing teachers' and students' awareness of the complexity of the assessment process, and improving the development and construction of task sheets. The study is an example of how a longitudinal approach using a range of research strategies, drawn from both quantitative and qualitative paradigms, can be effectively applied to investigate classroom-based literacy assessment. The study also provided a framework for the investigation of classroom-based literacy assessment practices which might be applied to other research contexts. The findings reveal that the implementation and use of alternative approaches to assessing literacy in the high school context provided no easy answers to issues related to principles, practices and student participation in assessment. Finally, the findings from the study have revealed the importance of developing an understanding of the perspectives of all classroom participants if the effectiveness of assessment as a teaching and learning tool is to be optimised for all learners.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Literacy</field><field name="subject">Assessment</field><field name="subject">English Curriculum</field><field name="subject">High School</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157896</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ethnic Identity and Mental Health of Young Chinese Immigrants</field><field name="creator">Chen, Lifeng</field><field name="description">AIMS AND HYPOTHESIS: In Australia, there has been little research into the quality of young immigrants' mental health in relation to their ethnic identity and acculturation. This study aimed to determine whether there is a relationship between strength of ethnic identity and the mental health of young Chinese immigrants in Australia; and if so, whether the relationship between mental health and ethnic identity is mediated by the degree of acculturation to mainstream Australian society. Four theoretical models were proposed, according to the study hypothesis that young Chinese immigrants with high ethnic identity achievement, retained more ethnic cultural behaviour and a high level of acculturation to mainstream Australian society would be associated with greater satisfaction with life and less psychopathology. Furthermore, the study explored the roles played by other factors, such as self-esteem, ego defence styles, parental bonding and family relationships, in the theoretical models. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Brisbane, Queensland. Participants were recruited through secondary schools, a religious organisation and a social organisation. A sample of 456 young immigrants (aged 15 - 21), both males and females, who identified themselves as Chinese and had been living in Australia for at least 18 months at the time the study commenced, participated voluntarily in the study. Participants completed several questionnaires assessing their ethnic identity achievement, ethnocultural identity behaviour, acculturation, self-esteem, defence style, satisfaction with life, social functioning performance, psychiatric symptomatology and family issues. There were English and Chinese language versions of the questionnaires for participants to choose from. Of 456 sets of questionnaires, 351 were returned and of these 313 contained valid data. Group interviews were conducted with 30 participants discussing matters such as their identification with their Chinese background, their personal feelings and experiences of living in Australia, and their attitudes toward Australian culture. An Acculturation Scale was specifically developed to measure the degree of young Chinese immigrants' acculturation in aspects of Social Role and Language and Allegiance. The higher scores correspond to a higher degree of acculturation. The reliability of this scale is satisfactory and its validity acceptable. The total scores for the Acculturation Scale were used in the main statistical analyses. The Ethnocultural Identity Behavior Index (EIBI) was amended before being used in the study. The revised EIBI measures young Chinese immigrants' ethnic identity behaviour in mainstream Australian society in terms of their Cultural Activities and Social Interaction. The higher scores correspond to the more retained ethnocultural identity behaviour. Once again, the reliability of this instrument is satisfactory and its validity acceptable. The total scores for the revised EIBI were used in the main statistical analyses. RESULTS: There is a correlation between ethnic identity and acculturation, but there seem to be two dimensions of ethnic identity. Young immigrants' acculturation is positively associated with their ethnic identity achievement but negatively associated with their ethnocultural identity behaviour. This study proposes a multidimensional model of ethnic identity, acculturation and psychological well-being. The new model indicates that young immigrants display more satisfaction with life, better social performance and less psychopathology if they have achieved a strong sense of ethnic identity and a high degree of acculturation and exhibit less retained ethnocultural identity behaviour. Although ethnic identity achievement, ethnocultural identity behaviour and acculturation are all predictive of young immigrants' psychological well-being, ethnocultural identity behaviour correlates with psychological well-being in the opposite direction from ethnic identity achievement and acculturation. There are also differences in immigrants' ethnic identity, acculturation and psychological well-being associated with gender, language spoken at home, place of origin and length of residence in Australia. Further investigations suggest that a harmonious family environment with caring, less controlling parents not only provides an environment that protects against psychopathology, but also encourages young immigrants to achieve a strong ethnic identity, to acculturate, to develop high self-esteem and to feel satisfied with life. It was found that young immigrants' defence style plays a role in their ethnic identity achievement and acculturation, and thus in turn affect their psychological well-being. However, the mechanism of these effects remains unclear. It is assumed to be related to the level of young immigrants' maturity. CONCLUSION: A multidimensional model of ethnic identity, acculturation and psychological well-being is proposed from this study. High ethnic identity achievement, a high level of acculturation and less ethnocultural identity behaviour are associated with more satisfaction with life, better social functioning performance and less psychiatric symptomatology. However, this correlation is very complex and affected by multiple factors. Some factors are known - self-esteem, defence style, parental bonding and family relationships; some are unknown, and may be related to immigrants' individual characteristics and to social and environment factors. There is a great need for future research into this field.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ethnic identity</field><field name="subject">acculturation</field><field name="subject">mental health</field><field name="subject">satisfaction with life</field><field name="subject">psychopathology</field><field name="subject">adolescents</field><field name="subject">Chinese immigrants</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157895</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Load - Maintenance Interaction: Modelling and Optimisation</field><field name="creator">Townson, Peter Gerard Allan Luke</field><field name="description">All systems are unreliable in the sense that they degrade with age and usage and eventually fail. The degradation depends on the load (or stress) on the system and the maintenance actions. With higher load the productivity increases but this is achieved at the expense of faster degradation and more frequent failures. This in turn reduces the availability of the system. The yield (expected output per unit time), expected operational cost and the expected profit are functions of the load and the availability. The relationship between load and yield is a complicated function and depends on system reliability and maintenance actions. The thesis deals with determining the optimal load and maintenance actions to maximise the yield (or expected profit) or to minimise the expected cost. The thesis comprises of two parts (Parts I and II). Part I is theoretical in nature and looks at the modelling, analysis and optimisation issues. Part II deals with a real case study involving a dragline used in open cut mining. Part I starts with stress-life models which link the load on the system with the reliability of the system. It examines the empirical data in the form of S-N and P-S-N curves, and as WPP plots reported in the literature. The salient features are identified so as to assess the suitability of different models to model the stress-life data. Various Weibull models are assessed to determine their suitability to model stress-life data at the component level. This is followed by a discussion of the modelling at the system level. Optimal maintenance actions are derived based on component level and system level stress-life models. For the component level models, the optimal maintenance actions are derived for a variety of maintenance strategies (such as the age, block and periodic policies) for a specified load to minimise the asymptotic expected cost per unit time. Following this, the joint optimal choice of load and maintenance is examined. For the system level model, the optimal load is obtained to minimise the expected cost per unit time over the life of the system taking into account different actions such as minor and major preventive maintenance actions and corrective maintenance actions. Part II deals with a case study involving a BE1370W dragline. The dragline is used in open cut coal mining to remove the dirt (overburden) on top of the coal seam. This involves dragging the bucket, which is suspended from the boom, through the muckpile until full and then hoisting and swinging the bucket to the dumping point. The capacity of the bucket size determines the load on the dragline. The system level model studied in Part I is used to determine the optimal load to maximise the yield. The dragline was modelled as comprising of 25 components (or sub-systems). Each component was modelled using a system level model of Part I. The model parameters were estimated using real operating and maintenance data over two years. The optimal load to maximise the yield was derived and a sensitivity study carried out.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">S-N curve</field><field name="subject">P-S-N curve</field><field name="subject">load</field><field name="subject">stress</field><field name="subject">maintenance</field><field name="subject">reliability</field><field name="subject">dragline</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157893</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Evolution of Chinese Local War Doctrine and China's Military Readiness in Asia</field><field name="creator">Ng, Ka Po</field><field name="description">In post-Cold War Asia, military power remains the dominant factor in inter-state relations. With its emerging military power, China is clearly an important actor in Asian security. However, Chinese military power needs rigorous interpretation in order to know its true purposes. Military doctrine, as an ideational variable, is essential in interpreting China&#146;s material military power. Expanding Richard Betts&#146; concept of &#145;military readiness,&#146; this study proposes a doctrine-based model of military readiness to interpret Chinese military power. After the establishment of the PRC in 1949, China&#146;s development and use of military power have been shaped by a swing between local war and total war doctrines&#151;two ends in the conflict spectrum. The People&#146;s Liberation Army&#146;s (PLA) total war doctrine of Maoist People&#146;s War spanning from the 1960s to 1970s contributed to a defence in-depth posture. Its development of a local war doctrine since the 1980s has led to China developing a visibly offensive posture to achieve quick and decisive victory in future conflicts. Based on the doctrinal model of &#145;military readiness,&#146; Chinese military planning and deployments have led to a more flexible and agile PLA. But doctrinal weaknesses have left it still unprepared for conflict escalation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Military</field><field name="subject">Asian Security</field><field name="subject">Strategy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157894</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trades and Defining Sets: Theoretical and Computational Results</field><field name="creator">Ramsay, Colin</field><field name="description">Given a particular combinatorial structure, there may be many distinct objects having this structure. When investigating these, two natural questions to ask are: - Given two objects, where and how do they differ? - How much of an individual object is necessary to uniquely identify it? These two questions are obviously related, with the first leading to the concept of a trade, and the second to that of a defining set. In this thesis we study trades and defining sets, in the context of t-(v,k,lambda) designs. In our enquiries, we make use of both theoretical and computational techniques. We investigate the spectrum of trades, and prove an extant conjecture regarding this. Our results also suggest a more general version of this conjecture. A t-(v,k,lambda) design where lambda=1 is called a Steiner design, and the related trades are called Steiner trades. In the case t=2, we establish the spectrum of Steiner trades for each value of k, except for a finite number of values in each case. The connection between trades and defining sets is used to obtain some new theoretical results on defining sets of designs, and is exploited throughout the thesis. We also consider the collections of all trades and all defining sets in a design. A simple design is one which is a set, as opposed to a multiset. We present an algorithm to enumerate all the trades in simple designs. For non-simple designs we introduce the concept of a discriminating set, and present an algorithm to enumerate these. Output from these algorithms was used to investigate the trades and defining sets of a number of designs, and some new results were obtained. Given part of a design, its completions are all those designs that contain it. An existing algorithm to complete partial designs is examined, and a heuristic yielding a much improved algorithm for Steiner designs is discussed. This completion routine was used to investigate a number of designs, and new information on the size and distribution of their defining sets was obtained.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">defining set</field><field name="subject">trade</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157892</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Origins and Evolution of the North-Eastern and Central Polabian (Wendish) Religious and Political System</field><field name="creator">Zaroff, Roman</field><field name="description">The term Polabian Slavs is a generic name applied to the westernmost branch of the Western Slavs, now almost extinct. Those people are often referred to as Wends, but mainly in older historiography. In the Middle Ages they occupied the territory more or less corresponding to the former state of East Germany, the region enclosed by the Baltic Sea in the North, the Oder-Neisse rivers in the East, the Ore mountains in the South and the Elbe-Saale rivers in the West (see map 1). In Central Europe, with the exception of the Baltic Prussians and Lithuanians, some of the Polabian Slavs resisted Christianisation and remained stubbornly pagan until the middle of the twelfth century. In the course of history the Polabian Slavs came under increasing political pressure from the Franks and later from the Empire, in the period between the eighth and the twelfth centuries. From the north they were also hard pressed by the Danes and in some periods from the east by the growing strength in Poland of the Piast dynasty. By the end of the twelfth century most of the Polabian Slavs fell under German or Danish political control. Some of them in the central region, what is now the Land of Brandenburg, and the tribes in the South were fully incorporated into the Empire. Others, like the Obodrites and some of the Veleti in Western Pomerania, became part of the Empire as autonomous duchies ruled by the local princes, while the island of R&#252;gen and the adjacent mainland territories, although they continued to be ruled by the Slavic dynasts, had to acknowledge Danish suzerainty. The whole territory, despite some areas being under the Danish crown, became subject to strong German political and cultural influence. Assimilation and German colonization facilitated the process of the Germanization of almost the entire area between the Saale-Elbe and Oder-Neisse rivers. Over the centuries the Polabian Slavs have almost entirely disappeared as a distinct people. However, the process is not fully completed even today, for a small Sorb minority still retains its distinct cultural identity. The modern Sorbs, numbering around 100,000 people are living today in eastern Germany in the region of Lusatia (Lausitz in German or &#163;u&#158;ica in Sorbian), mainly around Bautzen and Cottbus. Approximately 60,000 of them still speak a Slavonic language. Although this work does not deal directly with the Sorbs of Lusatia, it is dedicated to those surviving Polabian Slavs. [No abstract available - text taken from Introduction]</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430108 History - European</field><field name="subject">Medieval</field><field name="subject">Slavs</field><field name="subject">Western Slavs</field><field name="subject">Slavic</field><field name="subject">Slavonic</field><field name="subject">Polabian</field><field name="subject">Religion</field><field name="subject">Paganism</field><field name="subject">Sventovit</field><field name="subject">Theocracy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157891</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Asynchronies in Synchronous Baculovirus Infections</field><field name="creator">Haas, Richard</field><field name="description">Baculoviruses are lytic insect viruses. Upon internalisation, the viral genome orchestrates a sequential expression process ultimately leading to lysis of the infected cell. Release of progeny capable of infecting other cells during the process completes the infection cycle. Studies of the infection cycle in cell culture are typically conducted by synchronous infection, i.e. near simultaneous infection of all cells, by means of high virus concentrations. The behaviour of the synchronously infected culture, such as the timing of onset of progeny release, is considered representative for the infection progression within individual cells. In reality, however, the synchronously infected culture only reflects the average behaviour of all infected cells. The infection progresses in individual cells display large variability; this is most obvious in the observation that within the same culture some cells undergo cell lysis at two days post infection while others remain viable up to four days post infection. Such variabilities or asynchronies observed in synchronously infected culture is the topic of this thesis. Using a simple phenomenological model, it is demonstrated that cell death and associated intracellular product release is adequately described assuming that the waiting time from infection to cell death follows a Gaussian distribution with a mean of 59 hours post infection (hpi) and a standard deviation of 15hpi. Unlike other deterministic model developed over the last decade (Licari and Bailey 1992; Nielsen 2000), this stochastic model does not make the biologically inconsistent assumption that cells continue to be metabolically active following loss of membrane integrity. While elegant in its simplicity, the model provides no explanation for the underlying stochasticity. Investigations into the cause of this dispersion of cell death highlighted further asynchronies in the specific recombinant protein yield, in viral DNA content, in virus budding rate, and in cell volume increase instead of clarifying the issue. A modelling framework developed by Licari &amp; Bailey (1992) and later Hu &amp; Bentley (2000) incorporates the number of infectious particles each individual cell receives as a possible source of the dispersions in the host cell responses. However, this was found NOT to be the cause of the observed asynchronies under non-substrate limiting conditions. The timing of cell death, cell volume increase, recombinant product yield, viral DNA content, and virus budding rate is identical in Sf9 cell cultures infected at multiplicities of infection of ~5, ~15, and ~45 infectious particles per cell. Cell cycle variation has previously been suggested as a possible cause for observed asynchronies in baculovirus infections (Brown and Faulkner, 1975). The cell cycle phase is indirectly linked to the cell volume, because a G2-phase cell prior to division is inherently twice the cell volume of a G1-phase cell after cell division. By the same logic, it is also apparent that a G2-phase cell possesses twice the number of ribosomes of a G1-phase cell and thus a doubled protein production capacity. The effect of the cell cycle or cell volume on the baculovirus infection was determined by splitting an exponentially growing Sf9 cell culture into 5 cell size dependent fractions by centrifugal elutriation. The subsequent infection of these fractions showed (1) no dependency of the timing of cell lysis and cell volume increase and (2) approximately twofold increase of a) recombinant protein yield, b) viral DNA concentration, and c) budded virus yield. The recombinant protein yield showed a strong proportionality to the initial cell volume and the total RNA concentration during the late phase of the infection. As argued in chapter 6, these proportionalities suggest that the observed differences in the responses of the cell fractions to the baculovirus infection are more likely caused by the difference in the protein production capacity than by cell cycle specific molecules. This investigation gave also reason to speculate that infected cells cannot progress beyond the G2/M phase, and cell cycle progression continues undisturbed until ~8hpi when all cellular DNA replication appears to cease. Resuspended, infected Sf9 cells synchronised by centrifugal elutriation showed an identical cell cycle distribution as the non-infected control cultures for the first ~8hpi; G1 and G2/M phase cell proportions remained unchanged, whereas S phase cells progress to G2/M phase. Subsequently, the non-infected control cells resumed normal cycling whereas all infected cells remained at the same cell cycle phase from 8 to 11hpi. The initial cell cycle arrests in G2/M phase in both infected and non-infected cultures were caused through medium exchange.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Baculovirus</field><field name="subject">Multiplicity of Infection (MOI)</field><field name="subject">cell cycle</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157992</field></doc><doc><field name="title">WOODROW WILSON, WORLD WAR I AND THE RISE OF POLAND</field><field name="creator">Salisbury, Christopher Graham</field><field name="description">The scope of this thesis falls under the title, &#147;Woodrow Wilson, World War I and the Rise of Poland&#148;. The author&#146;s intention in selecting this topic is to examine the national and political re-emergence of Poland in the early twentieth century from a predominantly American perspective, as no other Western nation had played as great a hand in this &#147;rebirth&#148;. Covering the better part of a decade and more that begins by tracing Woodrow Wilson&#146;s ascension to the United States presidency, the examination centres upon the extent of and reasoning behind this Wilson-led influence as wielded through the channels of foreign diplomacy with and regarding Poland. Underlining America&#146;s first substantial foray into internal European diplomatic affairs, the study analyses, in turn, American involvement and interest in the Poles&#146; burgeoning drive towards self-determination and national sovereignty leading into and throughout the First World War; Poland&#146;s weighty part in the American government&#146;s documented preparations for peace in Europe; and Wilson&#146;s significant personal response to the ultimately successful course of the Polish independence movement, among other European developments leading up to the war&#146;s close. Research conducted in this exercise comprises an analysis of primarily American foreign diplomatic and domestic political sources (including considerable emphasis upon the personal papers and documents of Woodrow Wilson himself), as well as of similar Polish sources where they pertain to American interest. Furthermore, scrutiny of the diplomatic records of other nations necessarily involved in this arena of &#147;Great Power&#148; politics, such as Russia, Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Western Powers, adds to the inspection. The author believes that such investigation exposes the unlikely dimensions of America&#146;s, and especially Wilson&#146;s, critical involvement within this particular East European historical setting. In this light, Wilson&#146;s triumphant crusading on behalf of the rights of small nations &#150; and equally his ensuing reversal of fortunes over the Versailles Treaty and the League of Nations Charter &#150; can be seen to be embodied within the momentous revival of Poland&#146;s independence and the subsequently rocky path of the &#147;new&#148; nation&#146;s fledgling statehood.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Woodrow Wilson</field><field name="subject">First World War</field><field name="subject">Polish Question</field><field name="subject">US foreign diplomacy</field><field name="subject">relief campaign</field><field name="subject">self-determination</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157888</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Plum Sickness: a novella and Wrestling the Blue Cactus: grappling for meaning through story and the self: writing depressive illness</field><field name="creator">Bond, Sue</field><field name="description">This thesis contains two parts: a novella, Plum Sickness and a critical essay, Wrestling the Blue Cactus: grappling for meaning through story and the self: writing depressive illness. The novella tells a story of Judith Black, a young woman with depressive illness. It begins with her admission to hospital after a suicide attempt, then goes back in time to explore her relationships with her lover Michael, and her parents John and Aileen Black. There are fantasy passages showing her attempts to deal with negative attitudes to mental illness as well as the illness itself. The critical essay is a deliberate effort to explore the various influences on my approach to the writing of depressive illness without referring to any personal illness experience of my own, and without making detailed reference to Plum Sickness. I wanted to write a piece that could stand on its own, as well as an accompaniment to the novella, and I kept the depressed person in mind as my reader. The essay begins with particular medical writings, is followed by memoir, Anne Sexton's poetry, Virginia Woolf, The Imitation of Christ, self-help literature, and finishes with self-representation in fiction and an exploration of storytelling through The Blank Page by Isak Dinesen.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">depression</field><field name="subject">fiction</field><field name="subject">writing depressive illness</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157887</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Viable Software: the Intelligent Control Paradigm for Adaptable and Adaptive Architecture</field><field name="creator">Herring, Charles Edward</field><field name="description">The Intelligent Control Paradigm for software architecture is the result of this work. The Viable Software Approach is developed as an instance of the paradigm. The approach uses the Viable System Model as the basis for software system architecture. The result is a model-based architecture and approach for developing software systems by piecemeal adaptation with the goal that they become adaptive systems at runtime. Software built in this manner is called Viable Software. Viable Software represents a unifying class of self-controlling software that is an &#147;intelligent&#148; control system. Cybernetics, Control Theory, and Complexity Theory are the background for this work, and aspects relevant to this work are presented. These results are related to software architecture and software engineering. Rationale for the selection of the Viable System Model as a basis for software systems is given. The Viable System Model is described. The model is restated as an Alexanderian &#147;pattern language&#148; to make it more accessible to software engineering. A Viable Software Approach is proposed and expressed in the form of a Product Line Architecture that arranges the Viable System Model, the Viable Software Architecture, a Viable Component Framework, and a Component Transfer Protocol into a system for generative programming. An important result is the formalisation of the pattern of the Viable System into the interface specifications of the Viable Component. Three case studies illustrate the approach. The first is an analysis and extension of the Groove collaboration system. This study shows how the approach is used to map an existing system into the Viable Software Architecture and add fuzzy-adaptive user interface controllers. The second study presents the design and detailed software construction of an adaptive camera controller as part of a smart environment. The final study shows how a Business-to-Business e-Commerce system can be evolved and an expert system-based controller developed to implement business contracts.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">280302 Software Engineering</field><field name="subject">700199 Computer software and services not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Software Architecture</field><field name="subject">Viable System Model</field><field name="subject">Intelligent Control</field><field name="subject">Adaptive Control</field><field name="subject">Adaptable Software</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157886</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inconsistencies in the rights of review of the merits of Commonwealth administrative decisions</field><field name="creator">Thackeray, Vincent Gregory</field><field name="description">Government intervention in the financial and social affairs of citizens has increased dramatically in the last fifty years. As a result, government administrative decisions continually affect the everyday lives of people. Many of these decisions are discretionary. Modern administrative law has grown to meet the need for governments, rather than the courts, to supervise the exercise of administrative power so that injustice resulting from misuse of power can be avoided. The merits review system is an integral part of this administrative law. The effectiveness of the merits review system is dependent upon how Parliament makes provision for merits review in the legislative process. The object of this thesis is to analyse and evaluate the effectiveness of the scope of the Commonwealth administrative law merits review system. An evaluation of the availability of rights of review of the merits of Commonwealth administrative decisions will determine the extent to which Commonwealth law provides for merits review of administrative decisions. This thesis makes such an evaluation by undertaking an empirical study of the merits review provisions in Commonwealth legislation. The empirical study analyses 1,070 Commonwealth statutes and establishes that there are 340 statutes that confer power to make a reviewable decision or decisions. However, only 30 percent of these statutes provide for merits review of all reviewable decisions, while 44 percent provide for merits review of some decisions and 26 percent do not provide for merits review of any decisions. Consequently, the empirical study identifies inconsistencies in the provision of merits review of Commonwealth administrative decisions. The Australian parliamentary executive system of government has permitted a breakdown in the legislative drafting process that has allowed these inconsistencies to develop. Moreover, the executive arm of the Commonwealth government has diminished its accountability to Parliament for some of the administrative decisions made by it. A person affected by an unreviewable administrative decision may be treated unjustly as a result.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">350200 Business and Management</field><field name="subject">720400 Management and Productivity Issues</field><field name="subject">Inconsistencies</field><field name="subject">rights</field><field name="subject">merits</field><field name="subject">review</field><field name="subject">Commonwealth</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">administrative</field><field name="subject">decisions</field><field name="subject">Kerr</field><field name="subject">Executive</field><field name="subject">unaccountable</field><field name="subject">Parliament</field><field name="subject">injustice</field><field name="subject">empirical</field><field name="subject">study</field><field name="subject">statutes</field><field name="subject">legislation. breakdown</field><field name="subject">legislative</field><field name="subject">drafting</field><field name="subject">process</field><field name="subject">Parliamentary</field><field name="subject">Counsel</field><field name="subject">Administrative</field><field name="subject">Review</field><field name="subject">Tribunal</field><field name="subject">Council</field><field name="subject">Attorney-General</field><field name="subject">appeal</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157885</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The clinical reasoning process: A study of its development in medical students</field><field name="creator">Groves, Michele Anne</field><field name="description">Introduction: Clinical reasoning plays a crucial role in the provision of quality medical care. The consequences of poor clinical reasoning affect not only the patient concerned but the cost and effectiveness of the entire health care system. The aims of this thesis are three-fold: to monitor the development of clinical reasoning in students enrolled in a graduate-entry, problem-based learning program in a large medical school; to compare the clinical reasoning of these students at graduation with that of graduates of a traditional undergraduate course; and to gain insight into the nature of the clinical reasoning process which may be applicable to the teaching and evaluation of medical curricula. Methods: Two methods have been used to assess clinical reasoning. The first method, the Clinical Reasoning Problems (CRPs), was developed to meet specific criteria established for this study. A CRP is a short clinical scenario that provides information about a patient&#146;s presentation, history and physical examination. It is designed to assess the first three steps in the clinical reasoning process &#150; identification and interpretation of pertinent data, and hypothesis generation. Subjects are required to nominate the two most likely diagnoses and to identify and interpret the clinical features that they considered in arriving at each diagnosis. Responses are marked using a scoring system based on, and derived from, those of a reference group of experienced general practitioners (GPs). The CRPs are presented as a set of ten problems, each taking about ten minutes to complete. The second method used was the Diagnostic Thinking Inventory (DTI). This is a questionnaire designed to probe clinical reasoning style by assessing two aspects of clinical reasoning: flexibility of thinking and the degree of structure of knowledge in memory. In this way, and because it is not tied to a specific clinical scenario, it provides an assessment of reasoning style that is independent of the content of a subject&#146;s knowledge base. Subjects: Subjects were volunteer medical students from the last cohort of the undergraduate course and the first three cohorts of the new, graduate-entry MBBS Program at the University of Queensland. The reference group consisted of twenty-two GPs voluntarily recruited from all areas of Queensland. Results: Evaluation of the CRPs showed them to be a reliable and valid method for the assessment of clinical reasoning skill over a range of competence levels. The reliability of the DTI was similar to that found in other studies. Analysis of data collected using these methods showed that scores on both the CRPs and the DTI increased significantly in all student cohorts throughout the MBBS Program. Factors which influence performance on one or other of these indicators include stage of progression through the MBBS, gender, academic background and pre-admission interview score. Analysis of the causes of poor performance on the CRPs strongly suggests that medical students in the latter part of the MBBS have reached an intermediate stage in the development of reasoning expertise. This stage is characterised by the possession of a large but poorly structured body of knowledge. Subsequent examination of the CRP responses of the 21 reference GPs led to the classification of six of the GPs as diagnostic experts on the basis of their response patterns. Comparison of these GPs with the remaining 15 in the reference group has provided valuable information about the clinical reasoning characteristics of diagnostic experts and the relationship of the clinical reasoning process to diagnostic expertise. The principal finding was that integration of clinical data - the ability to connect relevant, accurately interpreted clinical information in such a way as to lead to the correct diagnosis - is the most critical step in the clinical reasoning process. This step is commonly disregarded or under-emphasised in the literature. Conclusion: This thesis indicates that both the style, and level of skill, of clinical reasoning develops significantly in MBBS students throughout their undergraduate medical education. In addition, it has demonstrated that the ability to integrate clinical information is a distinguishing characteristic of the clinical reasoning process of diagnostic experts. Although it is accepted that further development into true expertise can only occur as a result of extensive independent clinical experience, these findings are highly relevant to both the teaching and evaluation of medical curricula.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">clinical reasoning</field><field name="subject">diagnosis</field><field name="subject">medical</field><field name="subject">problem based learning</field><field name="subject">expert</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157884</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thor's Hammer Deflected: A history of the protection of power systems from lightning, with special reference to Queensland, 1950 to 1995</field><field name="creator">Mercer, Douglas Roy</field><field name="description">Electric power systems are a recent feature of community infrastructure, little more than a century having elapsed since the first public electricity supply was offered. The speed with which they have spread across the world, and the extent to which electricity has displaced other energy sources in commercial, industrial and domestic applications, has been quite remarkable. The widespread availability of a reliable supply of electricity has become one of the dominant factors in the lifestyle of the citizens of developed countries, and one of the differences between developed and developing countries. Yet not many histories of this remarkable industry have been written, and most of those have confined their attention to political and administrative matters, although technical issues have virtually dictated the pace of development of the industry. In the 1920s, when power systems began to spread beyond city centres, lightning became a major adverse factor in their capital costs, operating costs and reliability, and inadequate reliability reduced the rate of acceptance of electricity supply by the public, especially in rural areas. Although lightning has long inspired fear and wonder, its fundamental nature - the fact that it is an electrical discharge - was not known until less than three centuries ago, and the first measurements of lightning currents and voltages were not made until the middle 1920s, when instruments for measuring the electrical properties of lightning first became available. Intensive research programmes were undertaken in America, Britain, and some European countries from about 1925 onwards, but no research on the effects of lightning on power systems was undertaken in Australia until after 1950. This delay of almost three decades forced Australian power system engineers to base some very important aspects of power system design entirely upon data from other countries, which was of doubtful applicability in Australian conditions. During this period, the uncertainty over basic design data resulted in some power systems being over-insulated, with consequent waste of capital expenditure, while others were under-insulated, and had to be modified later to achieve adequate reliability. It is believed that this long delay in commencing lightning research in Australia was caused by a number of factors, including community attitudes to higher education and research (other than primary industry research), and the belief of many managers in the electricity supply industry that only the major manufacturers of electrical plant, located mainly in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, could successfully conduct power system research. In 1948 the Senate of the University of Queensland decided to replace the Chair of Engineering with four Chairs in separate branches of engineering. The founding Professor of Electrical Engineering, S.A. Prentice, was appointed in 1950 and soon decided to adopt lightning and its effects on power systems as the principal research thrust of the new Department. By the late 1950s, the University of Queensland had become the recognised centre of Australian research in lightning and high voltage insulation. With financial support from the electricity industry, the University completed a new high voltage laboratory in 1960, and soon began to be recognised overseas as a significant contributor to the world-wide search for knowledge in those areas. During the next fifteen years, the cooperative research programme of the University and the electricity industry developed fully, and valuable research was pursued in a number of areas, including the impulse strength and arc-quenching properties of Australian hardwoods used in poles and crossarms, the prediction of lightning outage rates of transmission lines, the causes of high lightning-failure rates in distribution systems, the performance of insulation under pollution conditions, and the validity of high voltage test procedures. The work frequently involved people from the electricity supply industry as well as people from the university, and attracted attention in overseas countries as well as in Australia. In 1974 Prentice reached retiring age, but the principal members of the staff he had recruited continued to produce research of high quality, and of considerable practical benefit to the electricity industry. By 1995, Prentice's principal staff members had reached or were approaching retirement, and the nature of lightning research had changed somewhat, with the principal interest turning to the details of the lightning stroke itself, and to protection of buildings and electronic equipment rather than power systems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430111 History - Other</field><field name="subject">780107 Studies in human society</field><field name="subject">lightning</field><field name="subject">electric power systems</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157883</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations of optimum design of heat exchangers of thermoacoustic engines</field><field name="creator">Ishikawa, Haruko</field><field name="description">The study of thermoacoustic effects is a relatively new area, particularly in application to thermoacoustic engines. For thermoacoustic engines to be commercially viable, there are still many aspects to be investigated, not only practical aspects but also at the fundamental level of physics. Particularly lacking is research on heat exchangers in thermoacoustic engines, despite the fact that this is one of the most important components, for which a design methodology does not yet exist. The primary aim of this work was to investigate the design methodology for heat exchangers in thermoacoustic devices to improve their efficiency. In this work, second law analysis was chosen as the design methodology and was applied to a simplified model of heat exchangers in thermoacoustic engines and its validity was examined. However, for the analysis to be useful to design practical devices, further knowledge of the heat transfer mechanism in oscillatory, compressible flow, and on the development of boundary layers under such conditions are required. This is not currently available for thermoacoustic devices. The commercial software PHOENICS was used to investigate this oscillatory heat transfer problem numerically. To test the capability of the software for simulating thermoacoustic phoenomena, two dimensional standing waves and thermoacoustic couples were simulated at various operating conditions and geometries, including conditions very close to those at heat exchangers in thermoacoustic engines. The results were compared with existing analytical solutions and the results of numerical simulations from others and showed that PHOENICS is capable of simulating thermoacoustic effects. However, the accuracy of second order effects, such as heat flux induced by thermoacoustic effects, was limited by the capability of PHOENICS and the results should be interpreted with this in mind. Energy and flow fields from thermoacoustic couple simulations were investigated from plots of energy vectors, energy lines, instantaneous velocity fields, particle traces and energy dissipation.The dependence of such quantities on plate spacing, plate length and Mach numbers are presented. One important result from these test which is relevant to the design of regenerators or heat exchangers in thermoacoustic engines was that a net heat pumping effect appears only near the edges of thermoacoustic couple plates, within about a particle displacement distance from the edges. Also it was observed that the energy dissipation near the plate is proportional to the plate surface area but increases quadratically as the plate spacing is reduced. The results also indicated the presence of larger scale vortical motion outside the plates which disappeared as the plate spacing was reduced. The presence of such vortical motion did not seem to influence the heat transfer to the plates. In order to simulate heat exchangers in thermoacoustic engines without simulating the whole device, boundary conditions representative of those near the ends of the regenerator plate were considered and tested. Although in some test cases, the simulation converged to a solution with minimal energy imbalances, there was a major discontinuity in the energy flux vectors near the boundary. Further investigations (both numerical and experimental) are required to provide further insight into the boundary conditions which need to be specified for future simulations of heat exchangers in thermoacoustic engines.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">thermoacousics</field><field name="subject">second law analysis</field><field name="subject">heat exchangers</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157882</field></doc><doc><field name="title">fsfsdfsd</field><field name="creator">test, test</field><field name="description">sgsadgsgsg</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fsdf egfsda wsdefw</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157881</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Finite Element Modelling in a Coastal and Marine Environment</field><field name="creator">Nielsen, Christopher</field><field name="description">This thesis documents the work undertaken to investigate and improve the theoretical and practical requirements for two-dimensional hydrodynamic modelling of coastal and estuarine areas, in particular to the inter-related aspects of: - wetting and drying of relatively large intertidal areas, and - the influences of waves on both current generation and variations in mean water level. The work outlined in this thesis began as a result of a perceived lack of understanding and confidence in the application of finite element models to coastal and estuarine situations. In response to this observation an investigation into the modelling parameters, particularly those that affect model performance during the simulation of wetting and drying, was undertaken. This initial investigation into the effect of these parameters upon model performance forms the first component of this study. Testing was performed to provide a quantitative assessment of the effect of these parameters upon model performance. The initial tests were simple examples designed to investigate the behaviour of a single specific parameter. Subsequent tests were more complex and assessed the combinations of various parameter selections. Once the model was shown to accurately simulate the movement of waters in a coastal and estuarine environment, wave forces were incorporated. The aim of the second component of the study was to modify the hydrodynamic model to predict the net current and water levels attributable to the influences of waves. Tests examined the effects of the application of wave induced forces in a range of applications, including the simple case of a uniform beach, comparisons to a physical model, and an example from a real coastline. The final outcome of this study is the development of a modelling tool that can accurately represent the forces of tides, winds and waves upon water movement in a shallow coastal and/or estuarine region. Furthermore, the qualitative and quantitative assessments of parameters that affect the performance of the model provide greater confidence in model results and better understanding of the applicability and limits of the modelling technique. Principal outcomes of the study are: - an improved understanding of the parameters which influence the behaviour of hydrodynamic models; - a better understanding of the applicability and limits of the modelling technique; and - an enhanced software system based on an existing modelling software system which is applicable to studies that require simulation of the combined forces of tides, winds and waves.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">finite element</field><field name="subject">coastal and marine environment</field><field name="subject">wetting and drying</field><field name="subject">marsh porosity</field><field name="subject">wave forces</field><field name="subject">RMA</field><field name="subject">wave induced currents</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157879</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effect Of Changing Water Distribution From Linear To Point Source On Vegetation And Soil Following Piping Of An Artesian Bore In A Semi-Arid Mulga Paddock</field><field name="creator">Cowley, Robyn Anne</field><field name="description">The effect of redistribution of artificial stock waters from a boredrain to pipes and troughs on the vegetation and soil resources was investigated from December 1994 to October 1998 in a sheep paddock in the semi-arid mulga woodlands of south west Queensland, eastern Australia. The study examined 1) the effect of changing water distribution on the distribution of understorey biomass, sheep, cattle and macropods at the paddock scale; 2) patterns in herbivores, vegetation and soil out from the boredrain and change through time following water redistribution; 3) patterns in herbivores, vegetation and soil out from the new troughs and change through time following water redistribution; and 4) the relative effects of native versus domestic stock on piosphere development out from a trough. Landscape zone and season were major drivers of vegetation and soil dynamics and patterns in this mulga landsystem. At the paddock scale, biomass and woody cover patterns were consistent with historical grazing gradients out from the boredrain, semipermanent waters and previous and current fencelines. There was a high degree of temporal variability in herbivore distribution patterns, not just related to changing water distribution. The native herbivores which presumably have evolved in this system were more likely to be correlated with forage resources than water at the scale of this study. This is in contrast to sheep whose spatial selection of feeding sites was partly influenced by non alimentary factors such as distance to waters, winds and fences, but largely unexplained. While sheep distribution was no longer correlated with distance from the boredrain following piping at the paddock scale, there was no evidence that 1) herbivores were focusing grazing activities around new troughs and 2) that vegetation patterns have changed following water redistribution. The boredrain had distinct gradients in vegetation and soil surface condition associated with it that persisted following rainfall and the lightening and then removal of domestic stock. Gradients in functional plant composition, diversity indices, grass cover and soil stability, revealed zones of reduced production potential parallel to the drain. Following closure of the drain herbivore activity rapidly declined, but there was little evidence of rehabilitation during three years of above average rainfall. Reassessment of the site at 5 yearly intervals over a period in excess of 20 years would better tell the story of change post-drain. Current data suggests the drain induced gradient will continue to persist for many years, providing a &#145;ghost of waters past&#146; In the first two and a half years following changeover from the boredrain to point waters, there was little change to the natural landscape patterns in soil and vegetation out from the southern troughs. Patterns in soil and vegetation around troughs initially reflected patterns of geomorphic zone and tree and shrub distribution. While there was an increase in stocking intensity immediately around the new troughs, there was little evidence of a vegetation and soil response to this increased stocking activity. However increased soil erosion and restricted shrub recruitment close to the troughs perhaps signal the beginnings of change out from the new troughs through time. Comparison between prevailing total grazing pressure, kangaroo only grazing and no large herbivore grazing, found that removal of stock had the effect of dramatically increasing the rate of woody cover change over the period of the study. In contrast the proportion of unpalatable plants increased most at the highest stocking rate with both domestic and native herbivores present. Soil surface condition and plant species also responded to exclosure from domestic stock, indicating that resting paddocks has the potential to improve soil and vegetation condition providing macropod densities are at similar levels to when stock are present. Given that the rehabilitation of degraded areas adjacent to boredrains is unlikely at least in the short term, and that little change has occurred out from new troughs, it is likely that there will be little net change in degraded land as a result of piping bores in mulga landscapes with the level of water availability of this study. Factors likely to influence piosphere development and ecological and management implications for the Boredrain Replacement Program are identified.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Boredrain</field><field name="subject">piosphere</field><field name="subject">vegetation patterns</field><field name="subject">herbivore distribution</field><field name="subject">degradation gradients</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157880</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rich Pensioner, Poor Pensioner: The income trade off dilemma between working and retirement life stages for average Australian income earners retiring between July 2000 and July 2016</field><field name="creator">Parry, Russell Neale</field><field name="description">Between July 2000 and July 2016 around 3.5 million Australian citizens and residents will reach a minimum age pension age with, on average, considerable remaining life expectancy. Contemporary policy settings would lead this demographic group to expect to enter and remain within an environment of near universal access to an age or similar pension program. This is mainly because Australian public retirement transfers are non-contributory, means tested, marital status differentiated and indexed to inflation and male wages. They are also available to age qualified residents irrespective of home ownership. These factors mean that discretionary private retirement income is both encouraged and discouraged by tax and means test treatments. Private retirement income above various annually reset thresholds would cause a gradual withdrawal of public transfers, progressively greater income tax and a Medicare levy. Thus saving choices can alter the relative income of pensioners at the cost of working age income and retirement age taxes and transfers. Australian social policy creates various interesting intertemporal income trade offs for individuals between private retirement income provision and pre-retirement saving. This thesis quantifies the trade off for single and married males and females who earn previous or projected average incomes prior to their minimum applicable age pension ages from July 2000 to July 2016. It does this by recreating and projecting the post age 45 saving efforts needed to produce three alternate retirement income profiles for outright homeowners. The first income profile is that of the Age Pension maximiser who retains no retirement savings. The second is the income profile of the &#145;theoretic&#146; pension maximiser who saves sufficient to utilise the means test &#145;free area&#146; of income available to pensioners. Third is the income profile for individuals who seek to annuitise their income to create a combined publicly and privately funded income stream that remains above the Age Pension income means test exclusion points for an average remaining life expectancy. Continuation of late 20th century pension maximisation and limited saving into the first half of the 21st century seem an inevitable consequence of present and foreseeable retirement income policies for the selected demographic group. However, this thesis explores a more optimal social policy outcome of significantly greater financial independence from the tax transfer system. This is in an environment where the compulsory superannuation system will produce an insufficient supplement to the Age Pension system for the researched demographic group. Consequently, this thesis explores the capacity for average income earners to produce a comparatively high income during a standard retirement.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pensioners</field><field name="subject">income</field><field name="subject">retirement</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157878</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Critical Sets in Latin Squares and Associated Structures</field><field name="creator">Bean, Richard Winston</field><field name="description">A critical set in a Latin square of order n is a set of entries in an n&#215;n array which can be embedded in precisely one Latin square of order n, with the property that if any entry of the critical set is deleted, the remaining set can be embedded in more than one Latin square of order n. The number of critical sets grows super-exponentially as the order of the Latin square increases. It is difficult to find patterns in Latin squares of small order (order 5 or less) which can be generalised in the process of creating new theorems. Thus, I have written many algorithms to find critical sets with various properties in Latin squares of order greater than 5, and to deal with other related structures. Some algorithms used in the body of the thesis are presented in Chapter 3; results which arise from the computational studies and observations of the patterns and subsequent results are presented in Chapters 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. The cardinality of the largest critical set in any Latin square of order n is denoted by lcs(n). In 1978 Curran and van Rees proved that lcs(n)&lt;=n&#178;-n. In Chapter 4, it is shown that lcs(n)&lt;=n&#178;-3n+3. Chapter 5 provides new bounds on the maximum number of intercalates in Latin squares of orders m&#215;2^&#945; (m odd, &#945;&gt;=2) and m&#215;2^&#945;+1 (m odd, &#945;&gt;=2 and &#945;&#8800;3), and a new lower bound on lcs(4m). It also discusses critical sets in intercalate-rich Latin squares of orders 11 and 14. In Chapter 6 a construction is given which verifies the existence of a critical set of size n&#178;&#247; 4 + 1 when n is even and n&gt;=6. The construction is based on the discovery of a critical set of size 17 for a Latin square of order 8. In Chapter 7 the representation of Steiner trades of volume less than or equal to nine is examined. Computational results are used to identify those trades for which the associated partial Latin square can be decomposed into six disjoint Latin interchanges. Chapter 8 focusses on critical sets in Latin squares of order at most six and extensive computational routines are used to identify all the critical sets of different sizes in these Latin squares.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280401 Analysis of Algorithms and Complexity</field><field name="subject">230101 Mathematical Logic, Set Theory, Lattices And Combinatorics</field><field name="subject">280405 Discrete Mathematics</field><field name="subject">780101 Mathematical sciences</field><field name="subject">Latin interchanges</field><field name="subject">intercalates</field><field name="subject">combinatorics</field><field name="subject">Steiner trades</field><field name="subject">Steiner triple systems</field><field name="subject">algorithms</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157877</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dimensional Changes of Investment Cast H13 Tool Steel : Measurement and Numerical Modelling</field><field name="creator">Morwood, Gregory David</field><field name="description">The recent development of prototyping systems which can produce patterns for investment casting with significant time reduction from traditional techniques, has raised interest in the use of casting as a method to produce tooling for downstream prototype testing. However, the accuracy of the casting process remains a major obstacle to the use of these tools. Simultaneous development of numerical modelling techniques suggest that it will be possible to predict casting contraction and distortion. If this were possible, corrections could be made before castings are produced, resulting in time and cost savings, as well as potential improvement in the accuracy. Before these models can be applied, there is a need for both material property data and experimental data with which to validate the numerical models. The aims of this work are to: 1) Develop further understanding of the processes in investment casting that contribute to the dimensional changes and variability. 2) Develop the required data for numerical modelling and apply this to simulate the dimensional changes in investment casting. An apparatus has been designed to measure the dimensional and thermal history of investment castings with displacement transducers and thermocouples. Casting dimensions were also accurately measured to determine the final contraction of nominally unconstrained and thermally constrained castings. Numerical simulations of the temperatures, stress and distortion were compared with the experimental results and provide a detailed explanation of the processes involved. Data for these simulations were developed using a combination of direct measurement and iterative inverse modelling.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">casting</field><field name="subject">h13</field><field name="subject">steel</field><field name="subject">dimensions</field><field name="subject">accuracy</field><field name="subject">contraction</field><field name="subject">simulation</field><field name="subject">numerical modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157876</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Classical Swine Fever in the Lao Peoples' Democratic Republic: Virological, Epidemiological and Clinical Studies</field><field name="creator">Blacksell, Stuart Dean</field><field name="description">Classical Swine Fever in the Lao Peoples&#146; Democratic Republic: Virological, Epidemiological and Clinical studies. Classical swine fever (CSF) is a highly contagious virus infection of swine caused by classical swine fever virus (CSFV). The CSF virus is a member of the genus Pestivirus of the family Flaviviridae. Classical swine fever is believed to be endemic in Lao Peoples&#146; Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). Infectious diseases, including CSF, are a major constraint to pig production in developing countries such as Lao PDR. The aim of this thesis was to investigate aspects and present data regarding the nature of CSF pertinent to Lao PDR. An introduction to Lao PDR, local pig production and a review of pertinent CSF literature is presented in Chapter 1. Low levels of veterinary infrastructure have exacerbated infectious disease problems in developing countries. Chapter 2 of this thesis described the construction and refurbishment of a project laboratory in Lao PDR for the diagnosis of viral diseases, in particular CSF virus Furthermore, a diagnostic specimen submission system was adapted to the local domestic and economic conditions. Poor diagnostic facilities and lack of disease reporting systems in Lao PDR have allowed diseases to spread largely unchecked due to low levels of recognition. The process of development and assessment of appropriate diagnostic assays to the local conditions is presented and discussed in Chapter 3. ELISA and RT-PCR technologies for CSF virus detection in clinical specimens were implemented. Variations to RT-PCR methodologies were also investigated to determine the most suitable technique for the local situation. Results indicated that the RT-PCR methodology was more sensitive than ELISA for the detection of CSF virus in fresh clinical specimens. Notably, the situation was reversed when decomposed samples were tested. Methodologies for the preservation and detection of CSF virus in samples subjected to local tropical condition were also investigated. The proprietary reagent RNAlater &#153; was found to be suitable for the preservation of CSF virus RNA under local conditions. Methodologies for CSF virus serology using the ELISA technique are also described. The majority of the pigs in Lao PDR are raised within village small-holder systems, with indigenous breeds being the most popular. Very little is known about the response of indigenous breed pigs to CSF virus infection. Chapter 4 described the pathogenicity of a Lao strain of CSF virus (Lao/Kham225) in both indigenous (Moo Laat) and imported pig breeds (Large white/Landrace cross-breed). Statistically significant (p = 0.05) differences in the breed-related susceptibility to CSF infection were demonstrated in clinical and haematological responses, and post-mortem pathology. The results demonstrated the course of CSF infection in the Large white/Landrace cross-breed was generally more acute than in the indigenous breed. Investigations into the epidemiology of CSF in Lao PDR are presented in Chapter 5. The distribution of CSF outbreaks during the period of mid-1997 to the end of 1999 was investigated and crude incidence results were calculated. Serological surveillance to determine the serological prevalence of CSF virus antibodies in selected regions of Lao PDR was performed during 1997 to 1999. Structured serological surveillance was performed in Vientiane Municipality, Bhorikhamxai, Khammouane and Savannakhet provinces during the survey period. Passive serological surveillance using samples from eight abattoirs in Lao PDR was also performed. Statistically significant (p = 0.05) intra- and inter-provincial differences were noted in a number of the surveys. The success of CSF vaccination via post-vaccination serology was also assessed. The results of the investigations determined that vaccination to prevent CSF infection was insufficient and post-vaccination responses were variable. Phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies to determine the genetic characteristics of Lao PDR and other regional CSF virus isolates are presented in Chapter 6. The 5&#146;-non-coding region and the E2 gene of CSF viruses were investigated to determine genetic relationships between Lao PDR and regional isolates. Genetic typing of all field virus isolates using phylogenetic analysis techniques indicated that all viruses belonged to genogroup 2. Phylogeographic analysis of field viruses revealed a delineation of sub-genogroup allocation on a geographic basis. Members of the sub-genogroup 2.1 originated in Northern and Central regions of Lao PDR. Conversely, members of the sub-genogroup 2.2 originated in Southern and Central regions of Lao PDR. All Vietnamese viruses examined belonged to sub-genogroup 2.2. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the Vietnamese viruses were largely distinct from Lao and Thai CSF viruses. With the exception of one virus isolate, all Thai viruses also belonged to sub-genogroup 2.2. With the exception of one Vietnamese vaccine virus, all vaccines examined belonged to genogroup 1. A general discussion of the results presented in all chapters, as well as implications for future research into this field, are presented in Chapter 7.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Classical Swine Fever</field><field name="subject">Lao Peoples' Democratic Republic</field><field name="subject">Asia</field><field name="subject">Hog Cholera</field><field name="subject">Pig Disease</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157875</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Peanut (Arachis hypogaea) Resistance to Sclerotinia minor and S.sclerotiorum</field><field name="creator">Cruickshank, Alan William</field><field name="description">The fungi Sclerotinia minor and S. sclerotiorum are the causal agents of two similar diseases of peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.). Both diseases cause significant losses in the Australian peanut industry. Chemical and cultural control methods will not provide complete control. Development of cultivars with resistance to Sclerotinia will be an important component of integrated control. The capacity to breed and select for such resistance efficiently must be established before serious investment of resources is made to develop Sclerotinia resistant cultivars. The aims of this project are: (1) to generate information that will assist in the improvement of Sclerotinia resistance in peanut; (2) to develop screening techniques; (3) to identify Sclerotinia resistant peanut germplasm; (4) to understand the inheritance and estimate heritability of resistance to S. minor; (5) to assess response to selection for resistance; and (6) to test the effectiveness of identified sources of resistance against both S. minor and S. sclerotiorum. Experiments were conducted to develop screening techniques applicable for this project and a full scale breeding program. A previously unpublished technique for evaluating physiological resistance was described and modified. The artificial inoculation technique using colonised bean pod segments was found to be more robust than using colonised agar disks: discriminating among the physiological resistance of peanut genotypes to Sclerotinia whether used in controlled environment cabinets or the simple tent structures, and working well with both whole plants and detached stems. Cultivars and lines with the shortest lesion length in this test have demonstrated resistance to S. minor in field experiments in both Australia and in the USA. The use of a tent structure in place of a controlled environment cabinet (CEC) to create a high humidity environment allowed larger numbers of individuals to be tested at one time. With this technique, glasshouse space and labour costs, rather than the size of the available CECs, are the limits to the number of individuals that can be tested at one time. This will allow mass screening of segregating populations or replicated testing of progenies in a breeding program context that would not be possible with limited CEC facilities. Calculating a Moderated Lesion Length (MLL) by eliminating the failed or very small lesions was found to improve precision in measuring resistance responses of genotypes. Compared to average lesion length, the MLL had a stronger association with foci count (FC), a measure of resistance in the field. In cases where the small lesions do not occur independently of peanut genotype, a small lesion count (SLC) can be used to describe that variation. The detached stem technique examined in this thesis was another useful tool for screening, particularly in situations where seed production by the plants is deemed critical, or where the seed quantity available would not provide sufficient replication for the pot-based glasshouse test. This study has clearly established that material which shows resistance to S. minor in the USA, is resistant to S. minor and quite likely to be resistant to S. sclerotiorum in Australia. The high level of resistance to both S. minor and S. sclerotiorum in germplasm from Texas, particularly TxAG-4, was confirmed. The component lines of Virginia 93 Bunch showed good resistance in the field, which is primarily architectural resistance. Physiological resistance to S. minor was also identified in a cultivar and a landrace from Indonesia and three rust resistant breeding lines from Queensland. All germplasm found to have high physiological resistance to S. minor belonged to the Spanish type. Inheritance of physiological resistance to S. minor was studied using a Generation Means Analysis (GMA) of the cross TxAG-4/VA 861102 and its reciprocal. The broad-sense heritability of physiological resistance on a single plant basis was estimated at 47%, much higher than earlier estimates obtained in field studies. The average gene action of Sclerotinia resistance genes from TxAG-4 was found to be additive. No dominance effects were detected in the GMA. A small but significant reciprocal effect between TxAG-4 and VA 861102 indicated that VA 861102 passed on some physiological resistance maternally. Selection of single F2 and F3 plants successfully achieved an improvement in physiological resistance as measured by MLL. Selection was based on both MLL and seed production and further work should be conducted to quantify the comparative contribution of these two criteria. To estimate a realised heritability of physiological resistance in early generation selection it may be necessary to use a detached stem technique so that seed production occurs independently of expression of disease resistance. Successful selection of highly resistant genotypes from small F2 and F3 populations was taken as a possible indication of oligogenic control of resistance. An experiment was conducted to confirm the value of resistance against both S. minor and S. sclerotiorum. TxAG-4 was found to have physiological resistance to both S. minor and S. sclerotiorum. This resistance was expressed against both Sclerotinia species by progeny that were selected for resistance to S. minor. On the basis of the information obtained, the comparative advantages of three strategies for Sclerotinia resistant cultivar development are described: (1) introduction of germplasm; (2) recurrent backcrossing with screening and crossing in the BCnF1 generation; and (3) pedigree selection. At present introduction and backcrossing are recommended as the preferred strategies. Pedigree selection for Sclerotinia resistance is expected to become increasingly valuable after the development, by introduction and backcrossing, of Sclerotinia resistant cultivars with other desirable</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">peanut</field><field name="subject">sclerotinia</field><field name="subject">disease</field><field name="subject">resistance</field><field name="subject">groundnut</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157874</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Unified Approach to Adapting and Retrieving Formally Specified Components for Reuse</field><field name="creator">Hemer, David George</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an approach to reusing components which alleviates some of the main problems encountered in component-based reuse; in particular modifying components to suit user's specific needs, and locating suitable components within a library. The focus of the thesis is on components described using a formal language (in other words components with a formal interface specification). The main reason for this is the concise and precise nature of formal languages, which can be exploited in developing more sophisticated methods and tools which take advantage of the semantics of the component. The solution is presented in two main stages: firstly a framework for adapting components is defined; secondly a framework for retrieving components based on matching component interfaces is defined. Both of these frameworks take advantage of the formal nature of the component interfaces, as a result more sophisticated tools can be developed. For generality it is proposed that formal languages used to represent interfaces are partitioned into three separate levels of granularity - expressions, units and modules - and solutions to adaptation and retrieval are developed separately at each level. An important consideration in developing these frameworks is to ensure that certain component properties are preserved when adapting and retrieving components. Having proposed these general frameworks, algorithms for adapting and retrieving components are defined in a more concrete and detailed sense within the CARE system. CARE was chosen because the language is relatively simple and compact, yet contains many of the features found in other formal languages, including: variables; functions; predicates; binders; application; typing; parameters; inputs and outputs (and their types); preconditions and postconditions; textual and formal parameters; separation of specification and implementation; case statements; modules; applicability conditions; encapsulation; and information hiding. These techniques for adapting and retrieving components have been prototyped as extensions to existing CARE tools. As a means of illustrating the value that these extensions have added to the overall CARE system, several example developments using the extended tools are presented at the end of the thesis. The approach to component reuse presented in this thesis represents a significant advance on other similar approaches. The approach given here is far more general than other approaches, particularly with respect to the scope of components and their interfaces that are considered. Also the adaptation framework goes beyond other approaches which have typically been restricted to parameter instantiation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">specification matching</field><field name="subject">retrieval</field><field name="subject">formal methods</field><field name="subject">components</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157872</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ross River virus: Ecology, natural history of disease and epidemiology in tropical Queensland</field><field name="creator">Harley, David</field><field name="description">Introduction This thesis concerns the mosquito-borne arbovirus Ross River (RR) virus. The main objectives were to determine the vector associations, the incidence, costs and natural history of disease, and behavioural and environmental risks for infection in tropical Queensland. 1. Literature review On the basis of the literature review there is strong evidence that Aedes vigilax, Ae. camptorhynchus and Culex annulirostris are important vectors in Australia. Aedes camptorhychus does not occur in Queensland. There is evidence that two peri-domestic container-breeding mosquitoes, Ae. notoscriptus and Ae. aegypti, may be vectors of the virus. The virus has been isolated from many other species but the role of most of these is unclear. It is unclear which vertebrate species are the major reservoirs for human infection. Studies are inconsistent with regard to the prevalence, duration and severity of symptoms and debility during RR virus disease. Nearly all epidemiological studies of RR virus have been descriptive. Therefore one can only surmise what the risks for human infection might be. Epidemiological studies to determine the associations between exposures and risk for disease do not exist. 2. Virus isolation from mosquitoes During 1996-1998 61,619 mosquitoes were processed for virus isolation. Thirty-three isolates of RR virus were made. The largest number (14) were from Ae. carmenti. The minimum infection rate (MIR) per 1,000 was 2.4. Isolates were also made from Ae. imprimens (1 isolate, MIR 10.3), Ae. kochi (2, 0.2), Ae. lineatus (1, 0.2), Ae. notoscriptus (1, 1.6), Ae. vigilax (1, 0.3), Cx. annulirostris (9, 0.3), Cx. vicinus (1, 4.0) and Mansonia septempunctata (3, 5.8). Ross River virus has been isolated from Cx. annulirostris, Ae. vigilax, Ae. notoscriputus and Ae. kochi but not from the other species. Ross River virus was not isolated from Ae. aegypti. Twenty-six isolates came from in or near a colony of 15,000 spectacled flying-fox, Pteropus conspicillatus. The proportion of RR virus positive pools from within 1 km. of this colony was significantly greater than elsewhere for all species combined and for Cx. annulirostris but not for Ae. carmenti. 3. The incidence and costs of Ross River virus disease Unpublished data on National, State and Territory notifications was collected. Crude incidence rates using census figures for denominator data were calculated. The same was done for the areas in which the other studies described in the thesis were carried out. An estimate of the cost of Ross River virus disease in Australia was made. During the period 1991-1998 of the States and Territories the Northern Territory (NT) had the highest and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) the lowest notification incidences. These were 62-281 and 0-3 per 100,000 per annum, respectively. During this period the notification incidence for Queensland ranged from 70 to 149 per 100,000 per annum. For the local government areas of Cairns and Mareeba, where the majority of cases of RR virus disease for the studies described in this thesis were recruited, the notification incidences were between 74 and 267, and 28 and 200, respectively. On the basis of an average of 4,800 cases per annum in Australia the cost of serological testing and medical consultations were estimated at $443,520 and $105,600. Lost earnings were estimated at $1,798,560. The total cost for medical consultations, serological testing and lost earnings will therefore be over $2 million in an average year. 4. The natural history of Ross River virus disease In 1998 incident cases of RR virus disease were ascertained. Fifty-seven eligible cases were recruited but only 47 could be reviewed on 3 occasions and data on these were analysed. Cases were followed for up to 197 days. Review included history, examination and the administration of the Clinical Health Assessment Questionnaire (CLINHAQ) and Short Form-36 (SF-36) . On initial review the 3 most common symptoms were arthralgia, joint stiffness and myalgia affecting 97.9, 89.4 and 59.6% of cases, respectively. The joint types most commonly affected by pain at the initial review were the ankles, wrists, interphalangeal joints of the fingers, knees and metacarpophalangeal joints. Objective signs of joint inflammation were rare. The prevalence of signs of inflammation decreased and the prevalence of normal joints on examination increased through the reviews. The prevalence of use of NSAIDs decreased through the reviews. On the basis of CLINHAQ items regarding work performance functioning at work improved through the course of the reviews. Linear regression with days since symptom onset as the independent variable was performed for some variables. The 8 dimensions of the SF-36 were standardized to the Queensland population and analyzed longitudinally . Analyses of the CLINHAQ functional disability index (FDI) and the visual analogue scales (VASs) for pain, global severity, fatigue, gastrointestinal complaints and sleep, and the depression and anxiety scales were also performed. The slopes of all fitted regressions except the SF-36 general health dimension were significantly different from zero. All measures of disease severity returned to normal by 8 months from onset, many in a shorter period. 5. Behavioural and environmental risks for infection Fifty-five incident cases of RR virus disease were recruited and formed the basis of a case-control study of behavioural and environmental risks. They were matched to 85 controls. In the year prior to symptom onset the only leisure exposure that significantly altered risk was camping [Odds ratio (OR) = 2.15; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.07-4.35]. No peri-domestic activities in the year prior to onset significantly altered disease risk. Leisure exposures were also assessed in a 3-week exposure period ending 4 days prior to symptom onset. None significantly altered risk. No peri-domestic activity in this period significantly altered risk and nor did exposure to vertebrates or mosquitoes. Containers and vegetation around the subject's dwelling did not significantly increase risk. The presence of ice cream containers and buckets was significantly protective when assessed by questionnaire, however this was also assessed by inspection and was found to increase risk though not significantly so. It was concluded that the former finding was due to differential misclassification of exposure status. The premise condition index (PCI) was measured. A low PCI for the subject's house was associated with a significantly increased risk (3-4 relative to 7-9 as reference category: OR = 3.15, 95% CI = 1.07-9.25). Window screening did not alter disease risk and air-conditioning in the house or the bedroom decreased risk but not significantly so. Use of protective measures, except bed nets, in the year prior to onset was found to decrease disease risk. Personal repellents, mosquito coils and citronella candles significantly decreased risk. A dose response was shown for the number of protective measures from personal repellents, aerosol and surface sprays, mosquito coils, citronella candles and mosquito "zappers" used in the year prior to symptom onset. Pet ownership and proximity of dwelling to horses did not significantly alter risk. A preference for light coloured clothing was significantly protective (0.37, 0.15-0.89). Stratification by gender, date of symptom onset and geographical area was performed. Stratification by geographical area included a coastal and tablelands stratum. There were differences between the stratum-specific odds ratios for camping in the year prior to symptom onset, the presence of bromeliads in the subject's garden and a preference for light coloured clothing. Multivariate analysis demonstrated confounding by use of personal repellents, mosquito coils and citronella candles. When modeled together these were found to cause confounding among themselves. They also caused significant confounding of camping, outdoor work and the presence of banana trees in the subject's yard. Multivariate analysis of the association between PCI and disease risk failed to demonstrate confounding by use of protective measures or time between symptom onset and review. 6. Synthesis and conclusions The three research Chapters form a coherent body of public health research on the epidemiology (Chapters 5 and 6) and ecology (Chapters 4 and 7) of RR virus, and the natural history of RR virus disease (Chapter 6) in tropical Queensland. Conclusions are drawn from the research in the thesis. A set of priorities for future public health research on RR virus is suggested, and a pilot control program for Ross River virus disease in tropical Queensland is recommended.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arthalgia</field><field name="subject">Ross River Virus</field><field name="subject">Alphavirus</field><field name="subject">Arboviruses</field><field name="subject">Viruses</field><field name="subject">Vector - Arthropod</field><field name="subject">Disease Vector</field><field name="subject">Mosquito</field><field name="subject">Mosquitoe</field><field name="subject">Culicidae</field><field name="subject">Chiroptera</field><field name="subject">Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Prognosis</field><field name="subject">Case-control studies</field><field name="subject">Risk</field><field name="subject">Lyme Disease</field><field name="subject">Medicine - Tropical</field><field name="subject">Ecology</field><field name="subject">Disease - Endemic</field><field name="subject">Rheumatology</field><field name="subject">Joints</field><field name="subject">Arthritis</field><field name="subject">Emerging Infection</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157871</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bamaga diptych, Concerto for Cello and Orchestra, Seaside Dancers after couplets by E.E.

To prevent this occurring, lubricant layers and surface coatings are used to act as a barrier between the die and the casting alloy. The microstructures of a series of soldered layers on H13 tool steel core pins were examined after conducting high pressure die casting experiments with a specially designed die using removable core pins and Al-11Si-3Cu casting alloy. This showed that first, a casting alloy build-up layer formed, and then intermetallic phases nucleated at the die steel interface and grew to cover the entire surface in subsequent casting cycles. The structures of intermetallic layers formed during immersion of H13 tool steel into an Al-11Si-3Cu casting alloy melt were studied by X-ray diffraction and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). A thick composite layer away from the H13 steel substrate consisted of irregular intermetallic phases and solidified casting alloy. A thin intermetallic layer was present between the composite layer and an inner compact layer next to the steel substrate. The irregular intermetallic phase in the thick composite layer away from the H13 steel substrate was identified to have a body centre cubic (bcc) structure, abcc-( FeSiAlCrMnCu). The thin and continuous intermetallic layer between the composite layer and the inner compact layer was found to be structurally isomorphous with aH-Fe2SiAl8. The compositional differences observed between aH and abcc phases indicated that the latter consisted of a higher amount of chromium, manganese, copper, and a lower amount of iron. It was likely that the presence of chromium, manganese and copper in the H13 tool steel caused the transformation of aH&#174;abcc. The inner compact layer next to the steel substrate was identified to be orthorhombic h-Fe2Al5 containing silicon and chromium. An examination of lubricants to prevent soldering in high pressure die casting in conjunction with Nissan Casting Australia Pty Ltd. found that soldering was reduced by using a suitable lubricant. The chemistry of the lubricant, spray parameters, and die surface temperature were important factors in producing a protective lubricant layer. It was found that lubricant containing polypropylene waxes prevented soldering significantly better than lubricant containing polyethylene waxes. It was also found that the lubricant containing polypropylene waxes had lower surface tension. An examination of the use of iron oxide layers to prevent soldering in high pressure die casting was performed. H13 tool steel was oxidised in air and produced porous iron oxide with a mixture of haematite (Fe2O3) and magnetite (Fe3O4). These porous iron oxides did not completely prevent the H13 steel from soldering in immersion tests as intermetallic cones formed at the surface of the steel. Commercial steam tempering of H13 steel produced more compact iron oxide layers with magnetite (Fe3O4) and haematite (Fe2O3) structures. It was found that these compact iron oxide layers offered better protection against soldering than the porous layers created in air. Pure iron oxidised in a CO2/H2 gas mixture at a ratio of 95:5 at 550&#176;C produced structurally pure, compact magnetite (Fe3O4) layers. H13 steel oxidised in a CO2/H2 gas mixture at a ratio of 95:5 at 550&#176;C produced compact iron oxide layers that showed only magnetite (Fe3O4) structure. The magnetite (Fe3O4) layer containing chromium, manganese, silicon and vanadium formed next to the H13 substrate was found to be a very adherent layer and protected H13 steel from soldering in high pressure die casting experiments with a specially designed die using removable core pins and Al-11Si-3Cu casting alloy. An examination of aluminium oxide layers to prevent soldering in high pressure die casting was performed. Incoloy MA956 containing 4.5 wt.% aluminium, oxidised in air at 1100&#176;C, produced a single, compact, adherent oxide layer with a-alumina (Al2O3) structure, that prevented the formation of intermetallic phases between aluminium alloy and Incoloy MA956 during high pressure die casting. However, non-reactive casting alloy build-up formed on the oxide coatings, similarly to physical vapour deposition (PVD) and vanadium carbide coatings. It was found that the thickness of the non-reactive casting alloy build-up was reduced by decreasing the roughness of the oxide coatings by lightly grinding of the surface of the coatings. The industrial application of these findings are discussed and directions for further research are presented.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">soldering</field><field name="subject">interfacial interactions</field><field name="subject">high pressure die casting</field><field name="subject">intermetallic</field><field name="subject">lubricants</field><field name="subject">iron oxide</field><field name="subject">aluminium oxide</field><field name="subject">magnetite</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157869</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Critique of realism and reality in the short fiction of three East German woman writers: Helga Schubert, Helga K&#246;nigsdorf and Monika Maron.</field><field name="creator">Petzl, Julia Theresa</field><field name="description">This thesis sets out to analyze the work of Helga Schubert, Helga K&#246;nigsdorf and Monika Maron. It concentrates on their neglected short prose, undertaking an in-depth analysis of the authors&#146; themes as well as examining their responses to reality. The overwhelming sense of entrapment in a &#145;stagnant&#146; society is the primary pre-occupation of all three authors; yet they each communicate this in different ways. Schubert endeavours to remain apolitical, although her criticism is aimed increasingly directly at the GDR. K&#246;nigsdorf is party-loyal and sees society&#146;s ills as a product of a distortion in values linked to industrialization. Maron, the dissident, consciously attacks the regime in her writing, using literature itself as means to expose the corruption of the state. By focusing on women, this study intends to further the establishment of female writers in mainstream academic discourse. The thesis reflects not just the political concerns of GDR writers, but also their philosophical and social approaches to life. An analysis of their short fiction provides a more complete overview of the authors&#146; development, thereby complementing studies of their novels.

Three nonlinear mechanical systems of this type are investigated and instabilities arising from their inherent nonlinearities are shown to exist for a range of system parameters and conditions. Subsequently, various nonlinear methods of vibration control have been employed to eliminate or suppress the instabilities. Analytical and numerical models have been designed to demonstrate various unstable dynamical behaviour with consistent results. The motion is studied by means of time history, phase space, frequency spectrum, Poincare map, Lyapunov characteristic exponents and Correlation Dimension. Numerical simulations have also shown the effectiveness and robustness of the control techniques over a range of instability conditions for each model.  The dynamics of a rotating body with internal energy dissipation is first investigated. Such a model may be considered to be representative of a simplified spinning spacecraft. A comprehensive stability analysis is performed and regions of highly nonlinear behaviour are identified for more rigorous investigation. Numerical simulations using typical satellite parameter values are performed and the system is found to exhibit chaotic motion when a sinusoidally varying torque is applied to the spacecraft for a range of forcing amplitude and frequency. Analysis of this model using Melnikov&#146;s method is performed and a sufficient criterion for chaotic instabilities is obtained in terms of system parameters. Evidence is also presented, indicating that the onset of chaotic motion is characterised by period doubling as well as intermittency.  Subsequently, Control of chaotic vibrations in this model is achieved using three techniques. The control methods are implemented on the model under instability conditions. The first two control techniques, recursive proportional feedback (RPF) and continuous delayed feedback are recently developed model independent methods for control of chaotic motion in dynamical systems. As such these methods are employed on all three rotating multibody systems in this dissertation. Control of chaotic instability in this model is also achieved using an algorithm derived using Lyapunov&#146;s second method. Each technique is outlined and the effectiveness of the three strategies in controlling chaotic motion exhibited by the present system is compared and contrasted.  The dynamics of a dual-spin spacecraft with internal energy dissipation in the form of an axial nutational damper is also investigated for non-linear phenomena. The problem involves the study of a body with internal moving parts that is characterised by a coupling of the motions of the damper mass and the angular rotations of the platform and rotor of the spacecraft. Two realistic spacecraft parameter configurations are investigated and each is found to exhibit chaotic motion when a sinusoidally varying torque is applied to the spacecraft rotor for a range of forcing amplitude and frequency. Onset of chaotic motion was shown to be characterised by period doubling and Hopf bifurcations. An investigation of the effects of damping upon the configuration is also performed. Predicted instabilities indicate the range of rotor speeds, perturbation amplitudes and damping coefficients to be avoided in the design of dual-spin spacecraft. Control of chaotic vibrations in this model is also achieved using recursive proportional feedback (RPF) and continuous delayed feedback. Subsequently a more effective model dependent method based on energy considerations is derived and implemented. The effectiveness and robustness of each technique is shown using numerical simulations.  Another rotating multibody system that is physically distinct from the previously described models is also investigated for nonlinear instabilities and control. The model is in the form of a driveline which incorporates a commonly used coupling called a Hooke&#146;s joint. In particular, torsional instabilities due to fluctuating angular velocity ratio across the joint are examined. Linearised equations are used for the prediction of critical speed ranges where parametric instabilities characterised by exponential build up of torsional response amplitudes occur. Predicted instabilities indicate the range of driveshaft speeds to be avoided during the design of a driveline which employs a Hooke's joint. Numerical simulations further demonstrate the existence of parametric, quasi-periodic and chaotic instabilities. Subsequently, suppression of these vibrations is achieved using the previously described model independent techniques.  Chaotic vibrations have also been observed in a range of simple mechanical systems such as a periodically kicked rotor, forced pendulum, synchronous rotor, aeroelastic panel flutter and impact print hammer to name but a few. It is thus becoming of increasing importance to engineers to be aware of chaotic phenomena and be able to recognise, quantify and eliminate these undesirable vibrations. The analytical and numerical methods described in this dissertation may be usefully employed by engineers for detecting as well as controlling chaotic vibrations in an extensive range of physical systems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nonlinear dynamics</field><field name="subject">multi-body</field><field name="subject">instabilities</field><field name="subject">chaotic</field><field name="subject">dual-spin</field><field name="subject">spacecraft</field><field name="subject">Hooke's joint</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157866</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS OF HEALTH: A STUDY OF PERCEPTIONS OF HEALTH AMONG IRANIANS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SF-36 IN AUSTRALIA</field><field name="creator">Momenzadeh, Sirous</field><field name="description">Australia's population as estimated at 30 June 1997 was 18.5 million of which 23.3 percent were born overseas. People from non-English speaking countries account for 14.2 percent of the Australian population. The 1996 Census shows that 2.6 million in Australia speak a language other than English at home. Therefore, no one can deny that Australia's society is characterised by cultural and linguistic diversity. In this context, migrant health services, and policies and the needs of people from different cultural backgrounds in the area of health have been addressed since the early 1980s. This thesis draws attention to the concept of 'health' as a fundamental dimension embedded in the area of health care and its related policies, services, programs, and health instruments. This current study questions the idea of universality in the concept of 'health' which suggests that a certain meaning and construction of health can be applied to any culture and society. For this purpose, a qualitative study was designed to explore the concept of health within a group of Iranians in Australia and to examine the appropriateness of the aspects and constructs of health identified in the SF-36, a self-report health status questionnaire developed in the United States, for an Iranian population. The methodology used in this research sought to collect qualitative data with a sample of 21 Iranians- 10 females, and 11 males. The NUD.IST program was used to organise and manage the data for the first time in the Persian language. Findings from the research provided evidence of the ways a sample of Iranians understood health and its embedded dimensions. The themes that emerged from the transcripts as significantly reflecting participants' conceptualisation of health included harmony, health as a concept which is both emotional and physical; integrated, spiritual aspect of health; tranquillity, physical and emotional aspects of health; social and familial relationships; and absence of disorder. Using these themes, a framework consisting of the components of health was developed. The components of the framework include holistic, spiritual, dualistic, social, operational, oppositional, and comparative and relative dimensions. Findings provide evidence which supports the assumption that a group of Iranians have certain views of 'concepts of health'. The results from the research provided evidence that some of the items and constructs relating to health included in the SF-36 seem to be problematic when administered to an Iranian population. The findings of the thesis suggest that a qualitative inquiry into Iranians' discourse of health and its dimensions should be made with an Iranian group before administering an instrument such as the SF-36. Analysis of findings suggests a number of recommendations and modifications when the SF-36 is translated from English into Persian and administered to a group of Iranians.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cross-cultural studies of health</field><field name="subject">health outcomes measurement</field><field name="subject">health attitudes</field><field name="subject">Iranians</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157865</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of Management of Subterranean Termites in Queensland</field><field name="creator">Peters, Brenton Charles</field><field name="description">i ABSTRACT I investigated aspects of the management of subterranean termites in the field by evaluating the protective values of preservative treated softwoods and evaluating the potential of softwoods conditioned by decay fungi or heat to produce termite monitoring and aggregating devices. As part of the investigation, it was necessary to: &#183; develop assay techniques suitable for research into the natural resistance of timbers, the efficacy of wood preservatives and termite biology and foraging behaviour; and quantify variation in termite responses to untreated softwoods in various situations in the field using these techniques. Field bioassays were conducted with two Australian Coptotermes species to determine protection of pine sapwood afforded by borate compounds (Chapter 2). Coptotermes lacteus (Froggatt) was examined in winter and C. acinaciformis (Froggatt) in winter, spring and summer at two localities in Queensland. Hoop-(Araucaria cunninghamii Ait ex D. Don) and slash-pine (Pinus elliottii Engelm.)-sapwood blocks were placed in plastic containers and attached to termite mounds or infested trees. Termite response was determined by mass losses over five weeks and modelled. Coptotermes lacteus was relatively benign in winter and for 1.0 and 2.5% mass losses of hoop-pine sapwood, borate retentions of 0.20 and 0.06% mass/mass (m/m) boric acid equivalent (BAE), respectively, were derived. With C. acinaciformis, for 1.0 and 5.0% mass losses of hoop-pine sapwood, borate retentions ranged from 0.49 and 0.25% BAE, respectively, in winter to 0.76 and 0.47% BAE, respectively, in late summer. For 1.0 and 5.0% mass losses of slash-pine sapwood in summer, borate retentions of 0.58 and 0.14% BAE, respectively, were derived for C. acinaciformis. These results support conclusions from earlier laboratory studies conducted elsewhere. Prevention of damage by field populations of termites was not achieved. Marked intercolony variation in response to borate compounds was demonstrated, highlighting the usefulness of this rapid technique. The need for long-term field exposure trials to calibrate the lunch-box technique and to facilitate technology transfer to industry, is indicated. For comparison, termite response to white cypress (Callitris glaucophylla Thompson and Johnson), a naturally termite resistant timber, is also reported. A field bioassay was conducted to evaluate responses of C. acinaciformis to untreated southern-yellow-pine (Pinus spp.), hoop-pine and slash-pine blocks (Chapter 3). Sapwood blocks were placed in plastic containers and attached to trees infested with the termites during summer. Containers with a test block of each of the timber species were prepared. These and other containers were exposed to termites for 10 weeks. Termite feeding response (&#147;voracity&#148;) was assessed for all blocks by determining the mass of wood consumed. Termite voracity differed among trees. Variation in termite responses to individual hoop-pine feeder-blocks within a container was appreciable and consistent between containers. Variation in termite responses to the test blocks was appreciable, with hoop pine being significantly more susceptible to termite attack than either slash pine or southern yellow pine. Southern yellow pine is a generic name for five species of pine which are difficult to separate reliably. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using &#147;southern yellow pine&#148; to ensure that samples are at least from the same species of pine and preferably from the same length of timber. The sensitivity of both the bioassay and the statistical tests was demonstrated. Of particular interest was the similar level of termite response to the test timbers in the two sections of the experiment. The usefulness of feeder-blocks to initiate reliable attack rather than to promote sustained attack, is worth further attention. Sapwood stakes of Australian-grown hoop pine, slash pine, radiata pine and North American-grown southern yellow pine were exposed to subterranean termite attack in an in-ground bioassay (Chapter 4). Stakes in bait containers and bare stakes were attacked by C. acinaciformis and Schedorhinotermes intermedius (Brauer). Susceptibility of these timbers was evaluated with regard to potential for termite monitoring and aggregation. Variation between timbers and difference between termite species are described. The relevance of these data to suppressing foraging populations of subterranean termites, in Australia, using insect growth regulators, is discussed. Four field bioassays were conducted using two species of Australian subterranean termites, C acinaciformis and C. lacteus (Chapter 5). Hoop-pine blocks decayed using 14 fungi for four weeks and for 10 weeks were subsequently conditioned using dry heating, freezing or moist heating, and then exposed to termites. Blocks decayed by Gloeophyllum abietinum [Persoon: Fries] Murrill, Trametes lilacino-gilva (Berkeley) Wright &amp; Deschamps, Schizophyllum commune Fries and Rigidoporus undatus (Persoon) Donk and subsequently oven dried, were attacked the most. Oven drying generally enhanced termite feeding responses in these two field bioassays. In a third bioassay, blocks of five softwood timber species conditioned with two high temperature regimes were exposed to C. acinaciformis. Slash pine was attacked the least. Mean mass losses for hoop pine, Caribbean pine (Pinus caribaea Morelet), radiata pine and the interspecific F1 hybrid between Caribbean and slash pine were not significantly different. For C. lacteus, slash and hoop-pine blocks were attacked the least while radiata pine was attacked the most. Additional heating at 105&#176;C increased the susceptibility of most timber species. Relationships between heating duration and the consumption of hoop-pine-sapwood blocks were determined using results from a fourth bioassay. Heating the timber increased feeding responses for both termite species. The selective and rapid response of the termites highlights the usefulness of this field technique for multiple-choice bioassays. The cyclodiene termiticides were withdrawn from use, in Australia, as from 30 June 1995. Implications for the management of subterranean termites in Queensland are discussed. Community perceptions of the use of chemical pesticides and cost do not favour the widespread use of preservative treated timber in buildings. An integrated pest management approach to termite control is the likely direction for the future in Australia. A range of building techniques, regular inspections, and attention to factors that predispose existing buildings to termite attack can reduce the risk of damage from termites, but do not eliminate that risk. There will be an increased need for reliable preventative and remedial treatments involving bait technology. Much more work is needed on termite biology, foraging behaviour and bait toxicants before a baiting system can be confidently commercialised in Australia. Directions for research in Queensland are discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">subterranean termites</field><field name="subject">wood preservation</field><field name="subject">borates</field><field name="subject">bait technology</field><field name="subject">Coptotermes</field><field name="subject">Schedorhinotermes</field><field name="subject">field bioassay</field><field name="subject">softwood susceptibility</field><field name="subject">decay fungi</field><field name="subject">heat treatment</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157864</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Migration Systems of Helicoverpa punctigera (Wallengren) and Helicoverpa armigera (H&amp;uuml;bner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in Australia</field><field name="creator">Rochester, Wayne Allan</field><field name="description">The contemporary view of insect migration is one of a behaviourally distinct form of movement that is an adaptation to temporary habitats. Migratory insects are characterised by a syndrome of behavioural and physiological traits that promote migration. The migration syndromes of particular species are variations on the general syndrome, and depend on both selective pressures from the environment and the evolutionary response that is supported by the genetics of the syndrome traits. The pattern and role of migration in a particular population are determined by the interaction between the environment and the species&#146; migration syndrome. Complete understanding of migration in a population therefore requires a combined consideration of the population&#146;s environment, migration syndrome and genetics. A recently developed conceptual model of a generalised insect migration system facilitates such a holistic treatment of insect migration. The model is built around four components: the migration arena (the environment); the population trajectory (the changing population demography); the migration syndrome (the traits that implement migration and determine the fitness of migrants); and the genetic complex underlying the migration syndrome. Specific variants of the model can be derived for particular species and locations. The migratory moth species Helicoverpa punctigera (Wallengren) and Helicov-erpa armigera (H&#168; ubner) are widely distributed in Australia, and occur in both crop-ping and non-cropping areas. The habitats occupied by the species are often tem-porary and geographically separated. Moths colonise new habitats by long-distance migration. Both species are abundant in the periphery of the continent during summer. In winter, H. punctigera is almost exclusively confined to the far inland, whereas H. armigera mostly remains near the coast. This thesis describes the development and application of conceptual models of the migration systems of H. punctigera and H. armigera in Australia. The model for H. punctigera was used to formulate and test hypotheses on the species&#146; population trajectory. That for H. armigera was used to determine the effects of differences between the migration syndromes of the two species on the trajectory. The models incorporated data from empirical models and simulation models developed for selected parts of the migration systems. Bioclimatic models estimated the portion of the continent that is climatically favourable for colonisation by each species in each season. A second type of bioclimatic model estimated the effect of year-to-year variation in habitat quality on the distribution of H. punctigera breeding in the inland. Finally, a simulation model of moth migration estimated the frequency with which wind patterns support various migration pathways. For H. punctigera the portion of the continent predicted to be climatically favourable for breeding tended to cycle between the inland and the periphery, al-though, contrary to observations, central Queensland was predicted to be favourable year-round. In the far inland the winter breeding period was predicted to be sub-stantially shorter in Western Australia than in south-western Queensland. For H. armigera the potential distribution tended to expand and contract around a core area in central Queensland. The probability of H. punctigera breeding at a given site in the far inland during winter was positively correlated with the increase in vegetation greenness at the site between April and July. It was also related to soil and climate variables. Although breeding was predicted to occur more often in some areas than in others, the esti-mated distribution of breeding varied greatly from year to year, and breeding was predicted at any given site in only a minority of years. Validation analyses indicated that the migration model was sufficiently accu-rate for use in characterising the migration system. However, the limited vertical structure present in the available weather data (e.g. representing low-level jets) will prevent the model from confidently forecasting particular migration events. Complete annual cycles of the population trajectory of H. punctigera could be constructed within the limits of the migration arena and the known migration syn-drome. In eastern Australia the cycle included return migration from the eastern cropping areas to the far inland during autumn, as has previously been proposed in the literature. In Western Australia two trajectories were possible&#151;one including spring diapause and a late summer generation in the south-west, and one including a summer generation in the far south-west. Additional trajectories were possible when pupae in spring diapause were assumed to emerge later than has been observed, or when summer quiescence was assumed to be more frequent than would be expected from our currently limited knowledge of its induction. These assumptions enabled H. punctigera to persist throughout the year in the far inland of eastern Australia, but not in that of the west. The conceptual models enabled certain hypotheses on the population trajectories to be tested with existing field and biological data. For other hypotheses they identified data that would enable testing. For a decision on which, if any, of the above H. punctigera trajectories operate in nature, we need more information on the frequency and duration of spring diapause and summer quiescence, plus additional data on breeding activity in parts of Western Australia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">migration</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="subject">Helicopverpa</field><field name="subject">Noctuidae</field><field name="subject">Lepidoptera</field><field name="subject">moth</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157863</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Decoherence, Measurement and Quantum Computing in Ion Traps</field><field name="creator">Schneider, Sara</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with various aspects of ion traps and their use as a quantum simulation and computation device. In its first part we investigate various sources of noise and decoherence in ion traps. As quantum information is very fragile, a detailed knowledge of noise and decoherence sources in a quantum computation device is essential. In the special case of an ion trap quantum computer we investigate the effects of intensity and phase noise in the laser, which is used to perform the gate operations. We then look at other sources of noise which are present without a laser being switched on. These are fluctuations in the trapping frequency caused by noise in the electric potentials applied to the trap and fluctuating electrical fields which will cause heating of the centre-of-mass vibrational state of the ions in the trap. For the case of fluctuating electrical fields we estimate the effect on a quantum gate operation. We then propose a scheme for performing quantum gates without having the ions cooled down to their motional ground state. The second part deals with various aspects of the use of ion traps as a device for quantum computation. We start with the use of ionic qubits as a measurement device for the centre-of-mass vibrational mode and investigate in detail the effect these measurements will have on the vibrational mode. If one wants to use quantum computation devices as systems to simulate quantum mechanics, it is of interest to know how to simulate say a k-level system with N qubits. We investigate the easiest case of this wider problem and look at how to simulate a three-level system (a so called trit) with two qubits in an ion trap quantum computer. We show how to get and measure a SU (3) geometric phase with this toy model. Finally we investigate how to simulate collective angular momentum models with a string of qubits in an ion trap. We assume that the ionic qubits are coupled to a thermal reservoir and derive a master equation for this case. We investigate the semiclassical limit of this master equation and, in the case for two qubits in the trap, determine the entanglement of the steady state. We also outline a way to find the steady state for the master equation using coherence vectors.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quantum computation</field><field name="subject">ion traps</field><field name="subject">decoherence</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157862</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cultural Change and Tourism: Towards a Prognostic Model</field><field name="creator">Carter, Rodney William</field><field name="description">The inter-relationship of cultural expressions is the basis of a model of cultural change (the cultural expression web) presented in this dissertation. The thesis and model are derived from formative case studies in developing nations of the Asia Pacific region. Cultural expressions, the 'physical' manifestation of culture, are often a 'product' for tourism. Many host communities trade cultural expressions for benefits that tourism can provide. As such, cultural expressions are a direct link between a host culture and the tourist. Modelling the change process in expressions is presented as a heuristic device as well as a prognostic tool for cultural impact assessment. The thesis proposes that cultural expressions are linked and that a change in one affects others. The magnitude of change to a cultural expression, and flow-on effect, depends on the significance of the cultural expression to the culture, the number of links and the strength of these links, determined by practice and its contribution to maintaining social structure and providing physical benefits to the individual and community. The dissertation documents thesis development from a personal construct, through analysis of formative case studies to identify conceptual categories, and formalisation of the model. The thesis and model are tested against cultural impact theory presented in the tourism literature and are found to be consistent or related. They are also tested against tourism related case studies from Indonesia and are found to explain reported changes to culture and cultural expressions. Methods to test the model empirically are presented.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asia Pacific</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">cultural change</field><field name="subject">cultural expressions</field><field name="subject">grounded theory</field><field name="subject">model</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">research methodology</field><field name="subject">resistance</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157861</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transcriptional Repression of the Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor Type 2 Gene</field><field name="creator">Ogbourne, Steven</field><field name="description">Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 (PAI-2) is a serine protease inhibitor traditionally regarded as a regulator of fibrinolysis and extracellular matrix degradation. More recently, PAI-2 has been implicated in diverse processes such as keratinocyte differentiation, cell death and viral pathogenesis. Although PAI-2s limited pattern of expression in vivo generates significant interest in this molecule, little is known about the underlying mechanisms controlling its cell specific regulation. In this thesis, the function that the previously identified PAI-2 gene silencer (Antalis et al., 1996) plays in the regulation of PAI-2 gene expression was investigated. The PAI-2 upstream silencer element 1 (PAUSE-1) is located approximately 1800bp upstream of the PAI-2 transcription initiation site. By employing electrophoretic mobility shift assays and transient transfection assays with mutant PAUSE-1 sequences, the sequence that defines PAUSE-1 was identified as TCT N3 AGA N3 T4. This element was shown to bind a number of protein complexes of similar electrophoretic mobility from various cultured cell lines. Transient transfection assays with the cervical adenocarcinoma, HeLa S3 and the macrophage-like, U937 cell lines, showed that PAUSE-1 repressed transcription by approximately 2.5 fold when cloned into the SV40 promoter or the minimal PAI-2 promoter. Ultraviolet (UV)-crosslinking analyses determined that the PAUSE-1 binding protein (BP) was approximately 67kDa. Examination of several similar DNA promoter sequences, such as the human IFNb and insulin promoters, suggested that PAUSE-1 might be an example of a universal silencer with the consensus sequence TCT Nx AGA, where x=4. The PAUSE-1 sequence shows significant homology to the binding sequence of the transcriptional regulators Ski, Smad3 and Smad4. EMSAs incorporating anti-Ski, -Smad3 and -Smad4 antibodies suggested that each are members of the PAUSE-1 BP complex in HeLa S3 cells. The PAUSE-1 BP complex has been purified by employing DNA affinity chromatography using streptavidin labelled magnetic beads. Approximately nine PAUSE-1 associated proteins from HeLa S3 extracts were visualised. Amino-terminal protein sequencing identified the first eight amino acids of the PAUSE-1 BP as EIQQRAAQ. The PAUSE-1 BP fails to show significant sequence similarity to any known protein and therefore potentially represents a novel DNA binding protein.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">transcription</field><field name="subject">silencing</field><field name="subject">repression</field><field name="subject">plasminogen</field><field name="subject">PAI-2</field><field name="subject">repressor</field><field name="subject">silencer</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157860</field></doc><doc><field name="title">UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING HIV-RISK RELATED SEXUAL BEHAVIOURS: EXAMINATION OF THE UTILITY OF THE THEORIES OF REASONED ACTION AND PLANNED BEHAVIOUR</field><field name="creator">Johnston, Trisha Carol</field><field name="description">The project described in this thesis was designed to investigate HIV preventive behaviour in heterosexual adolescents from a social-cognitive perspective. The project consisted of three studies. The design of each study was guided by a theory of human decision making, the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), and its extension, the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). In the first phase, an elicitation study was conducted in which characteristics of the population were identified. This study consisted of a series of semi-structured interviews in which participants' sexual behaviours, beliefs and normative influences were elicited. This information was required in order to enable studies two and three to target beliefs and behaviours relevant to the population being examined. In the second study, a large-scale survey of 417 university aged adolescents was conducted. This study was designed, primarily, to examine quantitatively the determinants of safe sex intentions and behaviours within the targeted population. Determinants of behaviour examined were those included in the TRA/TPB. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine the amount of variance in safe sex intentions and behaviours accounted for by TRA/TPB variables. In addition, a number of methodological issues related to criticisms of the TRA/TPB in the context of prediction of sexual behaviours were investigated. These issues included the utility of examining preference for alternative safe sex strategies in accounting for non-use of condoms, the importance of considering behaviour change as a process rather than an outcome, the importance of heat of the moment decision-making in the prediction of condom use behaviour, and the importance of consistent specification of partner type in survey instruments examining condom use behaviour. The third phase of the project consisted of an intervention study designed to modify HIV-risk related beliefs and behaviours. Design and evaluation of the intervention were guided by the TRA/TPB. The intervention was conducted using 102 participants, randomly assigned to intervention or control conditions. Methodological issues examined in study 2 were further explored in this study. Overall, it was found that the Theories of Reasoned Action and Planned Behaviour provided a useful framework for understanding, predicting, and modifying HIV-related sexual behaviours. The theories were found to explain between 67 and 73% of variance in condom use intentions, and between 52 and 55% of variance in behaviour. The theories were also found to be applicable to other safe sex behaviours with 50% of variance accounted for in monogamy intentions, and 34% of variance explained in behaviour, and 40% of the variance in non-penetrative sexual intentions, but only 6% of variance in non-penetrative sexual behaviour explained. In addition, a behaviour modification intervention based on the theories was found to lead to change in both predictor variables and behaviours, relative to controls. These changes were maintained over a 6-month follow-up period. That is, a series of mixed factorial Analyses of Variance revealed that the percentage of encounters in which a condom was used was significantly greater for the four weeks prior to follow-up compared with the four weeks prior to the intervention. In addition, the number of 'slip-ups' into unsafe behaviours was found to be significantly less. Change in TRA/TPB predictor variables which accompanied these behavioural changes included increased perceptions of behavioural control, more positive attitudes towards sexuality and safe sex behaviours, and more positive normative perceptions. These results were seen to provide strong support for the theories of reasoned action and planned behaviour and for their relevance to the study of HIV-preventive behaviour. However, prediction of safe sex behaviours was found to be enhanced in most cases by consideration of the methodological issues explored in each study. Thus, it was found that consideration of safe sex strategies other than condom use and the type of partner with whom the behaviour was occurring were important in both the prediction and evaluation of efforts to modify condom use behaviour. In addition, prediction of condom use behaviour and evaluation of intervention effects were enhanced by the consideration of behaviour change as a stage-like process, rather than as an all or nothing outcome. Results relating to the importance of heat of the moment decision making were less clear, and further research is recommended to clarify the issue.

As this is an applied ethics thesis, as opposed to a traditional philosophy thesis, it not only addresses the issue concerned, but also theoretically demonstrates how the proposed alternative approaches might be applied. Methodologically, the underpinning assumption for the thesis stems from the social constructionist belief that external influences can result in internal personal change. The overall thesis has been designed and structured taking a systems approach. As in nature itself, there is an overall aim or system, within which there are many interconnecting sub-systems or theories that can stand alone, but are also directly linked to each other so that my desired outcome can be achieved. In addition, the McCarthy/Kolb 4 Mat System of learning style preference has been embedded into the structure. Due to the multi-disciplinary and applied nature of the thesis, together with the aim and content of the study, a number of specific writing techniques have been employed. These techniques are intended to model some of the recommended strategies, and include inclusive language where possible, and a minimum amount of assumed knowledge, with narratives and stories sprinkled throughout each chapter, where relevant. Finally, a number of established theories have been used to support my proposal for a Heart-Centred Virtue Ethics. The foundation theory is virtue-based ethics, with a primary focus on the work of David Hume, and to a lesser extent Aristotle. This foundation theory is, in turn, supported by a number of dimensions of environmental philosophy including ecofeminism, ethics of care, and the transformational aspect of deep ecology. The relatively new management field of emotional intelligence also plays a major role. The context in which the thesis is set is sustainability from an organisational perspective, and the motivations for caring for nature, which are generally based on externally imposed, content-driven rules, from an anthropocentric perspective. However, I argue that the ideal motivation for caring for nature is based internally, on environmental virtue. Thus, people are taking care of the environment because in their heart they want to, not begrudgingly because externally imposed rules say that they have to. I suggest that movement through various levels of motivation to virtue might occur with an increase in ecological consciousness. In support of these claims, the main elements of environmental philosophy are discussed, and the relevant theories of virtue are presented, including environmental virtue. It is then argued that virtue per se is not enough &#150; that for one to be environmentally virtuous, one needs to have some kind of relationship with nature. To that end, the tenets of ecofeminism, and ethics of care, both based on the notion of relationship, are introduced. However, the dilemma is then presented; &#147;How do you persuade the predominantly male business community of the benefits of the so-called soft skills of virtue, ecofeminism, and ethics of care?&#148; An answer comes in the form of the new management field of emotional intelligence that is gaining acceptance amongst leading-edge organisations worldwide. Having introduced the concept of emotional intelligence, I then demonstrate that the main characteristics and aims of emotional intelligence are virtually identical to those of ethics of care and virtue, and ecofeminism. Therefore, initially the aims of these philosophies can be achieved within the business community, under the guise of emotional intelligence. With all the relevant theories firmly in place, I then return to the notion of raising ecological consciousness, and argue that one way that ecological consciousness might be raised is with a process-oriented, action strategy, that I call Heart-Centred Virtue Ethics. I then theoretically explore the application of heart-centred virtue ethics which is primarily based on emotional intelligence implementation strategies, combined with some intellectual intelligence procedures, and a third ingredient, meta-intelligence.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">environmental ethics</field><field name="subject">sustainable development</field><field name="subject">environmental philosophy</field><field name="subject">heart centred intelligence</field><field name="subject">triple bottom line</field><field name="subject">ecological affirmative action</field><field name="subject">natural capitalism</field><field name="subject">ecofeminism</field><field name="subject">meta-intelligence</field><field name="subject">emotional intelligence</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157858</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic Diversity in Sclerotinia species</field><field name="creator">Ekins, Merrick Grindon</field><field name="description">The general aim of this research was to analyse the genetic diversity in Sclerotinia species. More specifically the aims of this research were: to separate the three species of Sclerotinia, S. sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary, S. minor Jagger and S. trifoliorum Erikss.; to determine the breeding mechanism in S. minor and S. sclerotiorum; to test S. minor for the possibility of causing head rot of sunflower; to examine isolate of S. sclerotiorum from sunflower for aggressiveness and to see if this correlates with underlying genetic diversity. Sclerotinia species were separated using a variety of morphological and molecular criteria. S. minor, S. sclerotiorum and S. trifoliorum were analyzed on characters including host, sclerotial diameters, ascospore morphism, breeding type and RFLP analysis. Cloned DNA fragments from S. sclerotiorum were used as probes, these were compared with a cloned rDNA probe from Neurospora. These probes enabled clear separation of the Sclerotinia species. Sclerotial diameters appear to be good criteria for separating S. minor from S. sclerotiorum and S. trifoliorum. Host species may be sufficient criteria for separating S. sclerotiorum and S. trifoliorum for the plant pathologist in the field, however it was inadequate to accurately separate all isolates. S. minor and S. sclerotiorum were found to be homothallic ascomycetes. Apothecia were raised from all eight ascospores of a single tetrad from four isolates of S. minor and from an isolate of S. sclerotiorum indicating that inbreeding may be the predominant breeding type mechanism of S. minor. Ascospores from asci of S. minor and S. sclerotiorum were predominantly monomorphic, but rare examples of ascospore dimorphism similar to S. trifoliorum were found. Ascospores of S. minor were shown to be capable of causing head rot of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) when inoculated onto the floral face during anthesis. This is the first record of the carpogenic germination of S. minor in Australia and demonstration of infectivity of the ascospores on sunflower. Isolates of S. sclerotiorum differ significantly in aggressiveness on sunflower. One hundred and twenty isolates were collected from head and basal stem rots of sunflower in two locations in south east Queensland. The inoculation of sunflower stems with mycelial plugs and the measurement of lesion development were found to be reliable and revealed differences in lesion lengths produced by the different isolates. The time of assessment after inoculation was found to be of significance. Assessment two days after inoculation was more reliable than after three days or the linear rate of lesion development. The significant differences between isolates indicated that the pathogenicity testing method would also be good for virulence testing. The significant differences between the isolates however, was not consistent with repetition and division of the isolates into groups with different aggressive levels was therefore not possible. Differences in aggressiveness were more indicative of a continuous variation in pathogenicity rather than discrete aggressive groups. The number of significantly different isolates was most associated with the statistical test employed. The different multiple comparison procedures used made more difference in interpretation of aggressiveness than the data itself. Isolate aggressiveness did not correspond to the location of collection. Isolates collected from both head and basal stem rots were capable of causing stem infections therefore no specificity for mode of reproduction or infection was found. S. sclerotiorum attacking sunflower in Queensland and New South Wales was found to belong to one large population. Hierarchical sampling only detected one example of a plant lesion infected by more than one genotype. Thus most diseased plants are the result of a single infection only. Population substructuring could not be detected using 11 single copy Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) loci, suggesting gene flow occurs within the Australian population. Mycelial Compatibility Groups (MCGs), Random Amplified Polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs) single and multicopy RFLPs analysis indicated differences amongst the genotypes identified by each criteria. From 120 isolates the number of genotypes ranged from 13 to 24 depending on the marker used. However there were many similarities in the assemblages of isolates within each genotype. Genotypic diversity could not be correlated with aggressiveness. Initial mode of infection could not be correlated with genotypic differences. Genotypes were also not specific to geographic locations around Australia. However, genotypes identified in Australia were unique from genotypes identified in Canada and United States. Temporal studies also indicated a single population as genetic uniformity was maintained between years. Frequent recovery of the same genotypes around Australia suggests a clonal population structure. The Australian S. sclerotiorum population attacking sunflower appears to have a large asexual component most likely due to the sclerotial production and homothallic sexual reproduction. Gametic disequilibrium was found for all the populations. However, clonal correction of the samples meant that the majority of populations were not at gametic disequilibrium, indicating random associations among loci. Therefore genetic exchange and recombination would appear to be a component of the reproductive cycle of S. sclerotiorum in Australia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sclerotinia</field><field name="subject">Sclerotinia minor</field><field name="subject">Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</field><field name="subject">Sclerotinia trifoliorum</field><field name="subject">Sunflowers</field><field name="subject">Genetic Diversity</field><field name="subject">Population</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157857</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nonparametric Markov Random Field Models for Natural Texture Images</field><field name="creator">Paget, Rupert</field><field name="description">The underlying aim of this research is to investigate the mathematical descriptions of homogeneous textures in digital images for the purpose of segmentation and recognition. The research covers the problem of testing these mathematical descriptions by using them to generate synthetic realisations of the homogeneous texture for subjective and analytical comparisons with the source texture from which they were derived. The application of this research is in analysing satellite or airborne images of the Earth's surface. In particular, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images often exhibit regions of homogeneous texture, which if segmented, could facilitate terrain classification. In this thesis we present noncausal, nonparametric, multiscale, Markov random field (MRF) models for recognising and synthesising texture. The models have the ability to capture the characteristics of, and to synthesise, a wide variety of textures, varying from the highly structured to the stochastic. For texture synthesis, we introduce our own novel multiscale approach incorporating a new concept of local annealing. This allows us to use large neighbourhood systems to model complex natural textures with high order statistical characteristics. The new multiscale texture synthesis algorithm also produces synthetic textures with few, if any, phase discontinuities. The power of our modelling technique is evident in that only a small source image is required to synthesise representative examples of the source texture, even when the texture contains long-range characteristics. We also show how the high-dimensional model of the texture may be modelled with lower dimensional statistics without compromising the integrity of the representation. We then show how these models -- which are able to capture most of the unique characteristics of a texture -- can be for the ``open-ended'' problem of recognising textures embedded in a scene containing previously unseen textures. Whilst this technique was developed for the practical application of recognising different terrain types from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, it has applications in other image processing tasks requiring texture recognition.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Markov Random Fields</field><field name="subject">Gibbs Distributions</field><field name="subject">Parametric Estimation</field><field name="subject">Nonparametric Estimation</field><field name="subject">Parzen Window Density</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157856</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Musorgsky's orthography: An approach to tonal structures in his music</field><field name="creator">Perry, Simon David</field><field name="description">This thesis presents orthographic analyses of selected works of Musorgsky. The thesis argues that more traditional methods, such as voice-leading analysis or set-theory analysis, are, because of their particular historical and stylistic origins, limited in their application to Musorgsky's music and, on this basis, it sets out to demonstrate the value of an orthographic approach. The thesis takes existing orthographic analyses of the music of later transitional, or post-tonal, figures such as Skriabin and Bart&#243;k, and extends the application of this approach to an earlier transitional notation and attempts by composers to give cogent articulation to an increasing number of non-traditional pitch structures. The thesis falls into six chapters. The first chapter reviews common perceptions of Musorgsky, especially the notion that his music is somehow technically deficient or limited by a self-didactic eccentricity. It concludes by surveying analytical approaches to Musorgsky's music, and orthographic analyses of Bart&#243;k and Skriabin. The second chapter expounds the methodological principles of orthographic analysis. It examines common-practice conventions of orthography and then takes typical orthographic "problems" found in post-common-practice styles in order to show how novel structures are illuminated by the notational friction described above. The chapter concludes with a case study of Brahms's Intermezzo op.118, no 6, which demonstrates how conventions of common-practice notation are sustained in a piece from the central tradition. Chapters Three and Five are dedicated to the analysis of Musorgsky's music. Each takes a work, or selections from a work, leading to a discussion of several related orthographic and tonal issues. The music examined includes selected passages from Boris Godunov and Pictures at an Exhibition, and the entire song cycle Sunless. Several issues arise from these analyses, notably Musorgsky's use of octave symmetry and polymodalism, and his radical conception of relationships between individual chords and prevailing keys. The sixth chapter synthesises these findings and presents a revised view of Musorgsky's tonal thinking and practice, based on his orthography. At the centre of these findings lie key observations concerning the fusion in his music of "functional" and "non-functional" elements. This concluding chapter also speculates on the further potential role of orthographic analytical methods for musics of a traditional nature, especially those of Eastern European traditions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Musorgsky</field><field name="subject">music</field><field name="subject">orthography</field><field name="subject">tonal structures</field><field name="subject">analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157855</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of surfaces and structure on the rheology and processing of linear low density polyethylene</field><field name="creator">Halley, Peter J.</field><field name="description">Linear Low Density Polyethylene (LLDPE) is a relatively new plastic that is becoming widely used in many applications. In fact the production rate of LLDPE is vital in determining the process characteristics and subsequent properties of the end products. In this work we have examined, specifically, the influence of surfaces and structure on the rheology and processing properties of LLDPE. A review of the effect of surfaces on the rheology and processing of polymers is given, with particular emphasis on the interaction between metals and polymers. The influence of oxidative degradation and radiation on the structural modification of polymers is also reviewed. Standard rheological characterisation tests determined there was no effect of various metal and teflon surfaces on the rheology of LLDPE. There was also no evidence of wall slip on metal or teflon surfaces. The generalised Maxwell model (with Wagner's damping function) predicted dynamic and steady shear properties at standard characterisation rates well. The effects of degradation of LLDPE were quantified, and an increase in elasticity due to increased crosslinking of long polymer chains was noted during degradation tests. This effect increased with time (after a degradation time) and temperature. There was no effect of metals on the degradation properties of LLDPE, however, there was evidence of increased carbon-oxygen species (or increased oxidation) at the metal/LLDPE interface for metals containing copper at the interface (copper and brass). The migration of copper was facilitated by the low heat of formation of the oxides on the copper-containing metals. Increasing gamma and ion beam radiation dose decreased melting temperatures, heats of melting and crystallinity due to increased crosslinking at the crystallite surfaces and the reduction in crystal sizes. Gel fraction and tightness of gel increased with radiation dose due to increased crosslinking. Increased radiation dose also increased the elasticity and flow resistance of the samples as shown by rheological tests. The extension of a power law representation of the relaxation modulus of irradiated samples was extended to predict stress build-up and relaxation properties in steady shear tests. There was little effect of type of radiation (gamma or ion beam) on physical and rheological properties. However, there was a marked increase in the effects of irradiation in the melt (150degC) on the physical and rheological properties of LLDPE, which was due to the increased effective amorphous nature of the sample in the melt. The equivalence of the effects of degradation and irradiation are discussed. Viscosity was well predicted by the generalised Maxwell model (with Wagner's damping function) at processing rates. The normal stress differences calculated by Boger and Denn's model correlated well with this generalised Maxwell model, which was due to the inclusion of a flow rearrangement term. There was a marked increase in exit pressures, exit losses, flow rearrangement length, flow singularity, and exit stresses for flow over brass inserts at the die exit. These effects coincided with the production of a porous, copper-rich brass surface and it was postulated that this was the results of surface dezincification which caused increased adhesion between the LLDPE and the brass via physical interlocking at the porous surface. Extension of these results to melt fracture are discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Surface</field><field name="subject">structure</field><field name="subject">rheology</field><field name="subject">processing</field><field name="subject">polyethylene</field><field name="subject">LLDPE</field><field name="subject">plastic</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157854</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nucleation and Binder Dispersion in Wet Granulation</field><field name="creator">Hapgood, Karen Patricia</field><field name="description">The primary objective of this thesis was to develop a nucleation regime map to determine the controlling nucleation mechanism as a function of material properties and operating parameters. Two distinct regimes of nucleation were identified. The drop controlled nucleation regime occurs when nucleation conditions are ideal and one drop produces one nucleus granule and the controlling property is the droplet size. The nuclei formation kinetics are fast and the binder droplets penetrate into the powder bed pores almost immediately. In this region, the nuclei distribution reflects the drop size distribution as one drop tends to form one granule provided that (a) drops hitting the powder surface do not overlap - low spray flux Ya and (b) the drop must wet into the bed completely before bed mixing brings it into contact with another partially absorbed drop on the bed surface - low penetration time tp. If either criterion is not met, powder mixing characteristics will dominate. In the mechanical dispersion regime, the viscous or poorly wetting binder is slow to flow through the powder pores and form nuclei and good mixing is required for binder dispersion. The kinetics of nuclei formation were characterised using a simple drop penetration time test. A single drop of binder fluid was placed on a loosely packed powder bed and the time taken for the fluid to penetrate completely was measured for a range of powder and binder combinations. Loosely packed powder beds contain large macrovoids which are included in the existing Kozeny approach to estimating pore size. However it was found that these pores do not participate in liquid flow. A new two phase model was proposed where the total volume of the macrovoids was assumed to be the difference between the bed porosity and the tap porosity. A new parameter, the effective porosity eeff, was defined as the tap porosity multiplied by the estimated fraction of pores that terminate at a macrovoid and are effectively blocked pores. The pore sizes and drop penetration times were recalculated using the effective porosity and the predicted tp values were generally within an order of magnitude of the experimental results for all powders. The drop penetration time is reduced by small drops, low viscosity fluids, porous powders (but without macrovoids), large powder pores, high surface tension, low contact angle and pre-wetting of the powder bed. A new dimensionless group, the dimensionless spray flux Ya was defined to characterise the three most important operating variables in binder dispersion: liquid binder flowrate, drop size and powder flux through the spray zone. At low Ya, the majority of drops land on the powder sufficiently well separated to allow ideal &#147;drop controlled&#148; nucleation where one drop forms one granule. As Ya increases, the probability of drop footprints overlapping to give larger agglomerate nuclei increases. Monte-Carlo simulations were performed to validate the spray flux theory. The proportion of nuclei formed from single drops falls exponentially as Ya increases and to remain in the drop controlled regime Ya must be kept below 0.1. Analytical solutions based on the Poisson distribution for the fraction of single drop nuclei as a function of Ya were an excellent match with the Monte-Carlo data. Further validation experiments in carefully designed ex-granulator experiments and in an industrial granulator were performed. The results matched the theoretical solutions and demonstrated the ability of Ya to describe the nucleation zone in a real granulator. The proposed nucleation regime map demonstrated the interaction between drop penetration time and spray flux in nucleation. At short penetration times, such as the water and lactose system, decreasing Ya causes a shift towards the drop controlled regime and a narrower nuclei distribution. When penetration time is long, the nuclei size distribution is always larger and broader. Granulation may still be successful if the mechanical dispersion forces are able to break up the binder clumps and distribute the binder through the powder. The nucleation regime map should prove to be a useful tool for maintaining effective liquid distribution during scale-up as well as a useful trouble-shooting tool. It allows the dominant mechanism controlling the nucleation process to be easily identified using relatively simple parameters and a rational approach can then be used to control the properties of the nuclei.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">granulation</field><field name="subject">nucleation</field><field name="subject">binder dispersion</field><field name="subject">agglomeration</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157852</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing a common understanding and a mutual meaning structure of early childhood practices between trainees and educarers and children in child care settings</field><field name="creator">Shore, Margaret Ellen</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the effectiveness of a professional education model that was specifically developed for on-the-job training to assist seven child care trainees in six Child Care Centres in Queensland, Australia, to develop the competencies, motives, strategies and processes required to become expert educarers of pre-school age children. The intervention, which took place over 65 days, was implemented by six expert educarers who had previously been trained in using the Zone of Proximal Development (socio-cultural theory) to extend both the adult and the child learner&#146;s development. The educarers were asked to assist the trainees&#146; demonstration of motives, strategies, and processes during daily activities, and the educarers and trainees were asked to assist the children&#146;s demonstration of competencies in daily activities through the Zone of Proximal Development. As mass training for child care workers in group child care is still a relatively new phenomenon in Australia, and as little research has addressed both an adult and child learner&#146;s demonstration of competencies in the workplace with a permanent work-based instructor interacting through the Zone of Proximal Development, qualitative and quantitative approaches to analysing the data were chosen. These approaches present both a descriptive and a measured analysis of the day-to-day operations in which the training occurred. The study aimed to generate substantive theoretical ideas by extending socio-cultural theory (Tharp &amp; Gallimore, 1988) with Activity Theory (Leont&#146;ev, 1979), Legitimate Peripheral Participation (LPP) (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991) and Cognitive Apprenticeship (Brown, Collins &amp; Duguid, 1989). Data collection occurred through questionnaires at three periods of the study, through pre- and post-training Semantic Differentials, through the trainees&#146; daily journals and the professional tutors&#146; comments, and the educarers&#146; weekly and monthly reports. The study provides a triangulated perspective of two foci. The primary focus was on the changing relationship of the trainees with the educarers during the training programme, and whether this led to a converging understanding and the development of an evolving, mutual meaning structure. The perspectives are the trainees, the educarers, and their joint interactions. The personal experiences of the trainees as observers and participants in the day to day activities of the centre are interwoven with the modelling and assistance of the educarers and demonstration of the children. The results revealed that some of the trainees&#146; relationships with some of the educarers changed over three phases. These changes demonstrated that, in Phase I, the trainees observed and practiced activities under the supervision of the educarers who instructed them what to do and why, and discussed parents, as they started to develop a mutual meaning structure. Their relationship reflected that of a novice-expert. In Phase II the seven trainees acted independently, planning and implementing minor activities, still under the educarer&#146;s supervision however. In this phase the educarers modelled, observed, and commented on the trainees&#146; performance, as an evolving mutual meaning structure that reflected an aspiring expert-expert relationship developed. Three trainees attained only Phase II, while the other four continued into Phase III. In Phase III, the four trainees planned and implemented major activities independently while the educarers observed and commented on their performance and engaged jointly in tasks. Their relationships, which evidenced a developing and evolving mutual meaning structure reflecting a converging understanding, became collaborative for one dyad, one educarer perceived the relationship was collaborative and the trainee perceived it to be an aspiring expert-expert, while the other two dyads demonstrated an expert-expert relationship. It appears that the trainees, who experienced education motives with various strategies and processes implemented by the educarers through the ZPD in the training programme, demonstrated the greatest change in the relationships. For these trainees the peripherality of participation changed from Phase I, operating at the outer peripherality of the child care practice to operating closer to the centre of the practice in Phase II. The four trainees who transitioned to the centre of the practice in Phase III experienced educarers who exhibited consistent motives with flexible strategies and processes combining a wide variety of interactions through the ZPD. Emerging from the data, a dominant authentic activity, and a secondary aspect of this study was classroom management in general and morally acceptable behaviour (MAB) in particular. The dominance of this activity reinforces Tharp and Gallimore&#146;s (1988) finding that classroom management was the most stressful activity for first year teachers. The trainees&#146; appropriation of the motives, strategies and processes in episodes of morally acceptable behaviour as modelled by the educarers, showed, over the study, a convergence of understanding and the development of an evolving mutual meaning structure between the dyads. The second focus of the study provides a triangulated perspective on the changes in the relationship between the trainees and children during the training programme. The trainees&#146; and children&#146;s demonstration of competencies in morally acceptable behaviour is also addressed in this section: the perspectives are the trainees, the educarers and joint trainee-child interactions. The results reveal that the trainees&#146; relationship with children changed over the three Phases of the training programme. With a minor focus on children in Phase I, the trainees observed and practiced implementing activities demonstrating a novice-novice relationship. In Phase II, increasing their focus on children, the trainees took responsibility in minor activities demonstrating an aspiring expert-novice relationship. However in Phase III, with a dominant focus on children, expert-novice relationships were apparent. The four competencies developed for trainees to facilitate the children&#146;s demonstration of competencies in morally acceptable behaviour, discussing feelings and discussing actions, and showing verbal and non-verbal empathy, were acquired and used by the trainees who experienced education motives in the training programme, in Phases II and III. Concurrently, the children developed and increased their competencies in verbal and non-verbal acceptance of the interventions, and showed increased understanding of cause and effect and the ability to formulate hypotheses. Changes were also evidenced in the trainees&#146; conceptual understanding of educaring children as they integrated the concepts of discipline and control with three other essentials of educaring (caring, teaching and learning), into their conceptual understanding of educaring over the study. The development of an evolving, mutual meaning structure of the authentic activities that were practiced in the child care centres, showed a converging understanding was being established between educarers, trainees and children. There was also evidence of reciprocal assistance. Influence, assistance and teaching were not a one-way process. They did not flow in one direction only, from professional tutor to educarer to trainee to child. The child in turn influenced the trainee who influenced the educarer who influenced the professional tutor.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">child care</field><field name="subject">work based learning</field><field name="subject">zone of proximal development</field><field name="subject">trainees</field><field name="subject">learning contexts</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157853</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Object-Oriented Specification and Design of User Interfaces</field><field name="creator">Hussey, Andrew Patrick</field><field name="description">Formal methods are increasingly accepted for developing software systems, however their application to user-interface development is less common. In this thesis, we demonstrate the utility of formal object-oriented techniques for specifying, designing and implementing user-interfaces. The specification of a user-interface describes user-perceivable operations and information structures for an interactive system in an implementation-independent way. Operations of a user-interface specification define tasks. User-interfaces can be specified by a system of communicating agents where some agents are presented to users. An agent and its presentation together define an interactor. Defining the presentation of interactors is a design concern. Widgets are common re-usable interactors for which the presentation is usually well defined. Definitions of widgets may be stored in a library. We illustrate the characteristics of notations for interactor based specification using the Object-Z language and demonstrate using interactors from a widget library. Formal methods enable a "model-based" approach to be taken to the development of user-interface designs. A specification in terms of widgets is derivable from an abstract interactor-based specification. A corresponding user-interface design is usually easily identified from a widget-based specification. Interactor-based user-interface designs can be used to define an architecture for a corresponding system implementation. Derivation of a widget-based specification from an abstract specification corresponds to a task decomposition (i.e., the abstract and widget-based specifications enable the same tasks to be performed, although the operations involved differ). Task decomposition defines a compatibility relation between user-interface specifications. We give "specification patterns" to assist incrementally transforming an abstract user-interface specification to an equivalent specification in terms of widgets.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">User interfaces</field><field name="subject">object-oriented programming</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157850</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The governing bodies of Lutheran secondary schools in Australia : an exploratory study</field><field name="creator">Kloeden, Allen D</field><field name="description">The governing bodies of Lutheran secondary colleges and schools in Australia are comprised of a cross-section of community-minded people, who have accepted the invitation to serve as college council members.

For the single particle studies, the principal analytical tools used are based on singular perturbation theory. Use of these techniques in the temporal domain depends crucially on the smallness of the ratio of the deactivation rate constant to that of the main reaction. Depending on the range of Thiele modulus, whether small, intermediate or large, three different techniques are used in the spatial domain. First, when the Thiele modulus is small, a lumping technique due to Frank-Kamentskii (1955) is used to replace the Laplacian operator by a suitable constant. This reduces the coupled partial differential equations to ordinary ones. Main chemical kinetics of n-th order and of Michaelis-Menten type are investigated. Second, when the Thiele modulus is very large, matched asymptotic expansions in the spatial domain are used. The analysis is based on the smallness of the inverse Thiele modulus, 1/phi2. A moving reaction zone of thickness 0(1/phi) is found to separate the dead shell from the active core of the catalyst pellet. The catalyst activity profile exhibits a sharp change within the reaction zone and the structure of this profile is found to be self-preserving during the period of its propagation. Solutions are obtained for three different geometries - planar, cylindrical and spherical. The large Thiele modulus results obtained here are found to be more accurate than the shell-model solutions of Masamune and Smith (1966) (except for a slab geometry, when they are identical). Finally, for an intermediate range of Thiele modulus, finite Sturm-Liouville integral transforms along with the concept of an effective average are successfully applied. The approach taken is novel, and although not rigorously justifiable, it leads to results of suprising accuracy. The versatility of the technique is demonstrated by application to various non-linear problems which posess exact solutions and remarkable agreement is found. The finite-cylindrical catalyst pellet is also investigated using a double-integral transform in the spatial domain and it is shown that for small Thiele modulus, the infinite cylinder and slab results are good approximations to finite length cylinders with small and large ratio, R/L, respectively. The analytical solutions reported in this thesis agree well with the known numerical results of others (Masamune and Smith, 1966; Khang and Levenspiel, 1973 and Lamba and Dudukovic, 1978). The parametric - dependence of these solutions is explicit and numerical results can be easily obtained from them by hand calculation. All the single pellet results are brought together in the final chapter and used to analyze the performance of isothermal fixed-bed reactors undergoing poisoning. Such effects as external mass transfer resistance, pellet shape and chemical kinetic type are included in the analysis, which embraces the entire range of Thiele modulus.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">catalyst</field><field name="subject">deactivation</field><field name="subject">pellet</field><field name="subject">isothermal</field><field name="subject">reactor</field><field name="subject">bed</field><field name="subject">particle</field><field name="subject">poisoning</field><field name="subject">analytical</field><field name="subject">Thiele</field><field name="subject">chemical</field><field name="subject">biochemical</field><field name="subject">system</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157849</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Specification and Refinement of Timed Processes</field><field name="creator">Mahony, Brendan Patrick</field><field name="description">The use of predicate transformers to model the action of sequential programs has allowed the construction of a refinement calculus for expressing the formal verification of the top-down development of sequential programs.

Despite the successes achieved, there are significant limitations in the application of this technology to more complex wastewaters. These are defined as containing other organic compounds such as particulate and soluble proteins and fats, and originate from abattoirs (slaughterhouses), meat and food processing and similar industries. Complex wastewater is often difficult to degrade and components such as solids and fats have slow degradation kinetics and can diminish process performance. Also, the growth of granular sludge, which is critical for optimal performance in upflow reactors, is slow and granule properties such as shear strength and settling velocity are poorer. This is reflected in a lower treatment efficiency of 50%-60% in systems treating complex wastewater compared with efficiencies of 85%-95% in carbohydrate fed treatment systems.  This thesis examines specific aspects in the treatment of complex (proteinaceous) wastewater in high rate upflow anaerobic treatment plants and the influences of different conversion processes and microbial characteristics on design and operation. The research problem was approached in two ways:  The macroscopic conversion processes were examined by investigating and modelling a two-stage full-scale high rate hybrid reactor in Spearwood, Western Australia, designed and operated by ESI Ltd. This allowed localisation of the key conversion process; specifically hydrolysis of solids, which was found to occur mainly within the methanogenic reactor. Degradation of soluble proteins was rapid and all proteins were fully acidified in the acidogenic (first) stage even at very low retention times. Because of the rapid protein degradation rates, partial acidification, which is often a strategy to improve granulation rates, is incompatible with pH, flow and concentration equalisation.  The influence of a protein feed on granulation compared with a carbohydrate feed was examined by sampling granules from the above reactor, as well as two full scale brewery fed reactors and a full scale reactor fed fruit and vegetable cannery wastewater. The cannery fed granules had the highest shear strength and settling characteristics while the protein fed granules had low strength and density , low settling velocity and a comparatively wide size distribution. Both brewery fed granules had very similar and suitable properties. Molecular studies using fluorescent in-situ hybridisation (FISH) probing and microscopy indicated that the granules from the complex (protein) wastewater fed reactor had limited structural characteristics , possibly due to limited reaction rates (as opposed to diffusion rates). Granules from the cannery reactor and both brewery reactors had structures that appeared to be the result of diffusion limitations.  Therefore, the critical operational constraints when treating complex wastewater are the particulate biomass and particulate substrate. Awareness of process status could be increased by monitoring of biological and substrate solid inventory in the methanogenic reactor. The model developed in this thesis can greatly assist this. Complications due to particulate substrate and poor granule properties may be intrinsic to complex feeds. These constraints are probably best addressed by design of a methanogenic reactor specifically for complex wastewater. The design should attempt to separate substrate hydrolysis, minimise shear on the granules and retain solids.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">high-rate</field><field name="subject">anaerobic</field><field name="subject">complex</field><field name="subject">granulation</field><field name="subject">microbial ecology</field><field name="subject">shear</field><field name="subject">UASB</field><field name="subject">VFA</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157847</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Built Form and Culture: A Case Study of Gilbertese Architecture</field><field name="creator">Hockings, John</field><field name="description">The last two decades of architectural studies have been marked by a renewal of interest in human behaviour and how it is related to the environments we inhabit. This interest has stemmed from the recognition that much contemporary architecture, in its pursuit of economic technological efficiency, pays little or no attention to its human context. As part of the attempt to re-establish this context, designers and scholars alike have seen the need to increase our understanding of the nature of the relationship between man and his spatial environment.  The aim of this thesis is to examine the aspect of this relationship which emerges from the premise that the formal 'rules' of culture are one of the means used by man in the process of interpreting his spatial environment. Based on a field study in the Gilbert Islands in the western Pacific, this research outlines the specific nature of the cultural rules used by the Gilbertese in this process, and examines how the process has changed over time.  The thesis is divided into four sections. The Introduction outlines the argument for this type of study in more detail, and explains the theoretical framework developed to relate man, culture, and built form. Also included are the research methodologies used, and a brief physical description of the study area.  In the second section, Part One, four distinct units of traditional Gilbertese settlement pattern are identified - the home, the clan hamlet, the meeting house, and the island as a whole. Each is analysed as a physical environment, the arrangement and use of which were developed by the Gilbertese in accordance with certain relevant cultural practices. Taken as a whole Part One gives an overall outline of the important traditional relationships between built form and culture.  In the third section, Part Two, the impact of Western occupation and influence upon the traditional pattern of relationships is examined. Through an analysis of the manner in which the Gilbertese manipulated those relationships in response to such influences, it became possible to draw conclusions as to the workings of Gilbertese built form and culture, one against the other.  The eventual understanding of the built form/culture relationship, arrived at through the analyses conducted in Parts One and Two, is outlined in the final section, Concluding Remarks. The argument is again supported by notable examples cited earlier in the main text. The specific conclusions so drawn are then synthesised into a more general conclusion of interest to scholars and practitioners of architecture alike.  The thesis begins with the premise that culture would be a determining factor of much of the meaning which people read into their spatial environment. But, as evidence is collected and conclusions drawn, it is shown that such a view (suggesting that culture is used by people as a means of comprehending their architectural environment) cannot be sustained, and that the Gilbertese in fact use their architecture to explore and explain cultural ideas. So it is deduced that it is preferable to treat architecture as a means to a cultural end, thus avoiding the temptation, inherent in the initial premise, to attribute a falsely deterministic role to culture. Most importantly, it allows architecture to be seen as an active element in the cultural process rather than as a passive receptacle of cultural meaning.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Architecture</field><field name="subject">Gilbertese</field><field name="subject">Gilbert Islands</field><field name="subject">Pacific</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="subject">behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157846</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Detection of malignancy associated changes in cervical cells using statistical and evolutionary computation techniques</field><field name="creator">Hallinan, Jennifer Susan</field><field name="description">Abstract Malignancy Associated Changes are subtle alterations in the morphology and nuclear texture of cells in the vicinity of a malignant lesion. The phenomenon was first described in 1959, and has been the subject of considerable research in the four intervening decades, due to its potential utility to cancer screening programs. In this thesis the history of research into malignancy associated changes is reviewed, and the major findings of previous workers summarized. Original work aimed at improving the accuracy of classification of Pap smear slides is described in detail. A novel algorithm, which incorporates a genetic algorithm for feature selection and training of a neural network, is described. The algorithm was tested upon a large artificial dataset consisting of points from nested spheres in multiple dimensions. It was able to select the most discriminatory features and classify data with 99% accuracy on 80% of runs for two dimensional data, and on 90% of runs for three-dimensional data. The algorithm was also tested on two real data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the &#147;sonar&#148; data and the &#147;ionosphere&#148; data. On both of these datasets the algorithm produced a classifier using a subset of features which performed as well as previously reported classifiers using the full feature set. This algorithm was then tested on a large dataset of cell images, and its performance compared with that of the standard stepwise linear discriminant analysis approach. Both of these approaches produced similar results, which are comparable to those of previous workers in this field. Interestingly, runs of the genetic algorithm with different random number seeds tended to select different feature subsets, which produced approximately equivalent performance. This finding indicates that amongst the features used, which were selected from those previously identified in the literature as useful for MACs detection, many subsets exist which are equally discriminatory.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">malignancy associated changes</field><field name="subject">ROC curve</field><field name="subject">genetic algorithms</field><field name="subject">evolutionary computations</field><field name="subject">cervical cancer</field><field name="subject">neural networks</field><field name="subject">Pap Smear</field><field name="subject">computer image analysis</field><field name="subject">automated screening</field><field name="subject">pattern recognition</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157845</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Segmentation of Cell Images with Application to Cervical Cancer Screening</field><field name="creator">Bamford, Pascal Christopher</field><field name="description">This thesis develops image segmentation methods for the application of automated cervical cancer screening. The traditional approach to automating this task has been to emulate the human method of screening, where every one of the hundreds of thousands of cells on each slide is analysed for abnormality. However, due to the complexity of cervical smear images and the low error tolerance imposed upon the segmentation stage, only limited success has previously been found. A different approach is to detect malignancy associated changes (MACs) in a relatively small sample of the total population of cells. Under this paradigm, the requirement to segment every cell is loosened, but delineation accuracy and error checking become essential. Following a review of generic and cervical smear segmentation, it is concluded that prior work on the traditional approach to automation is not suitable for a MACs solution. However, the previously proposed framework of a dual-magnification system is found to be relevant and is therefore adopted. Here, scene images are first captured at low resolution in order to rapidly locate the cells on a slide. Cells that are deemed to be suitable for further analysis are then imaged at high resolution for the more accurate segmentation of their nuclei. A water immersion algorithm is developed for low resolution scene segmentation. This method achieves a rapid and robust initial segmentation of the scene without the requirement of incorporating extensive a priori knowledge of the image objects. A global minimum searching contour is presented as a top-down method for segmenting the high resolution cell nucleus images where the image objects are well characterised by shape and appearance. This latter method is tested upon 20,000 images and found to achieve an accurate segmentation rate of 99.47%. An error checking method, that uses segmentation stability as an indicator of segmentation success, is developed that is capable of detecting 100% of the failures of the nucleus segmenter, at the expense of discarding only 9% of the data. Throughout this work, contemporary issues in the field of generic image segmentation are presented and some of these are addressed for the cervical smear application. Finally, an avenue of future work is proposed which may lead to the much wider proliferation of computer vision solutions to everyday problems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">image segmentation</field><field name="subject">cell nuclei</field><field name="subject">active contours</field><field name="subject">cytology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157844</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multi-layer Perceptron Error Surfaces: Visualization, Structure and Modelling</field><field name="creator">Gallagher, Marcus Reginald</field><field name="description">The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is one of the most widely applied and researched Artificial Neural Network model. MLP networks are normally applied to performing supervised learning tasks, which involve iterative training methods to adjust the connection weights within the network. This is commonly formulated as a multivariate non-linear optimization problem over a very high-dimensional space of possible weight configurations. Analogous to the field of mathematical optimization, training an MLP is often described as the search of an error surface for a weight vector which gives the smallest possible error value. Although this presents a useful notion of the training process, there are many problems associated with using the error surface to understand the behaviour of learning algorithms and the properties of MLP mappings themselves. Because of the high-dimensionality of the system, many existing methods of analysis are not well-suited to this problem. Visualizing and describing the error surface are also nontrivial and problematic. These problems are specific to complex systems such as neural networks, which contain large numbers of adjustable parameters, and the investigation of such systems in this way is largely a developing area of research. In this thesis, the concept of the error surface is explored using three related methods. Firstly, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is proposed as a method for visualizing the learning trajectory followed by an algorithm on the error surface. It is found that PCA provides an effective method for performing such a visualization, as well as providing an indication of the significance of individual weights to the training process. Secondly, sampling methods are used to explore the error surface and to measure certain properties of the error surface, providing the necessary data for an intuitive description of the error surface. A number of practical MLP error surfaces are found to contain a high degree of ultrametric structure, in common with other known configuration spaces of complex systems. Thirdly, a class of global optimization algorithms is also developed, which is focused on the construction and evolution of a model of the error surface (or search spa ce) as an integral part of the optimization process. The relationships between this algorithm class, the Population-Based Incremental Learning algorithm, evolutionary algorithms and cooperative search are discussed. The work provides important practical techniques for exploration of the error surfaces of MLP networks. These techniques can be used to examine the dynamics of different training algorithms, the complexity of MLP mappings and an intuitive description of the nature of the error surface. The configuration spaces of other complex systems are also amenable to many of these techniques. Finally, the algorithmic framework provides a powerful paradigm for visualization of the optimization process and the development of parallel coupled optimization algorithms which apply knowledge of the error surface to solving the optimization problem.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">error surface</field><field name="subject">neural networks</field><field name="subject">multi-layer perceptron</field><field name="subject">global optimization</field><field name="subject">supervised learning</field><field name="subject">scientific visualization</field><field name="subject">ultrametricity</field><field name="subject">configuration space analysis</field><field name="subject">search space analysis</field><field name="subject">evolutionary algorithms</field><field name="subject">probabilistic modelling</field><field name="subject">probability density estimation</field><field name="subject">principal component analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157842</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Designing Software from Formal Specifications</field><field name="creator">MacDonald , Anthony John</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the process of designing software from formal specifications, in particular, specifications expressed in the Z notation. The initial phases of software design have significant impact on software quality and the transition from formal specification to design is not clearly understood. There is often no visible or obvious connection between the specification and the finished design. It is possible to add traceability with either verification or refinement, but I wish to understand and guide the design process. Investigating the design of software from formal specifications highlighted possible relationships between parts of the specification and parts of the design. A design strategy is introduced, that combines software architectural styles and formal specifications to influence the generated design. The design process is architecturally-specific, but a template for instantiating the design process to a chosen architectural style is presented. Specializations of the template are presented for the ADT-based architectural style and the event-based architectural style. These specializations of the template produce an architecturally-constrained, specification-influenced design process. Providing an architecturally-constrained, specification-influenced design process enables the software designer to produce better quality software. The constrained design process allows the designer to focus on the difficult aspects of design: understanding the problem, choosing the best abstractions, and finding a suitable solution.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Software Design</field><field name="subject">Formal Specifications</field><field name="subject">Software Architecture</field><field name="subject">Patterns</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157840</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding Depression: Beyond the Biomedical Model</field><field name="creator">King, David</field><field name="description">Introduction A literature review of the evidence regarding aetiology, classification, epidemiology and treatment of depressive disorders was conducted. All of the domains that constitute the biopychosocial model were investigated as a basis for testing the hypothesis that a biomedical approach, or any domain in isolation, is inadequate for fully understanding depression. An integrative, explanatory, conceptual model was developed, based on supportive evidence that can better inform the clinical encounter. Methods A combination of manual and electronic searches were conducted. Medline, Psychlit, Sociofile and the Social Science index databases were accessed with multiple key words. The University of Queensland library catalogue was also searched. Part A - Historical and Philosophical Basis The limitations and challenges of the biomedical model are followed by suggested responses, in particular a biopsychosocial model applied within a patient-centred consultation style. Various methods of scientific enquiry are needed to develop a more complete understanding of depression. Part B - Assessing the Evidence Evidence from epidemiological, biological and psychosocial research is reviewed. Depressive illness tends to be a chronic or recurrent condition with multifactorial causation, and occurs on a complex spectrum of severity. There is emerging evidence for a chronic stress response being the initial biological dysfunction, This is consistent with the frequency of stressful life events that precipitate depressive episodes. There is convincing evidence for predisposing factors such as low self-esteem, poor interpersonal skills and deficiency of social support. A range of treatment modalities, for example pharmacotherapy and various psychotherapies, appear to have similar effectiveness, which suggests that recovery occurs when the perpetuating cycle is broken at different sites. Part C - Integrative Models. Available schematic integrative models are reviewed and most fall short of integrating the three domains of the biopsychosocial, or fail to illustrate the circular nature of causation. A model is proposed, based on the evidence reviewed in Part B, that addresses both considerations. Conclusion Some causal factors for depression are supported by evidence. Models that integrate these findings are necessary to more fully explain depression. When applied in conjunction with patient-centred consultation styles, improved clinical outcomes could be expected. There is the potential for further research to test out the benefit of such a biopsychosocial approach, and to better elucidate component causes and reversible risk factors. There is a need for narrative approaches to receive considerably greater attention.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Depression</field><field name="subject">Aetiology</field><field name="subject">Biopychosocial Model</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157836</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adolescent pathways to mental health services</field><field name="creator">Wagner, Ingrid</field><field name="description">The age period of adolescence is significant for epidemiologic research because of the emergence of emotional and behavioral problems, which occur during this time. Many studies have shown that few of the adolescents identified as suffering significant psychological disturbance receive help from specialist mental health agencies. The recognition of this gap between identified need in the community and the utilisation of services underlies the pathways model proposed by Goldberg and Huxley (1980). Understanding the pathways by which the distressed person reaches specialist services may assist in the improvement of the quality of mental health care in the community. The studies of pathways have mainly focused on adult populations. However the dominant patterns of General Practitioner and Medical pathways found in these studies are inconsistent with those of adolescents. Their different level of social and emotional development affects both how they seek help and how their problems are perceived by significant others. This study examined the records of initial contact for adolescents aged 12 to 18 years, who were referred to three community based mental health clinics serving a regional health district of Brisbane, during the period of 1 June 1997 to 30 June, 1998. The results showed that the pathways by which adolescents reach mental health services were broader in scope than those of adults. Parent, Education Professionals and General Practitioners were the dominant pathways to service. The factors most commonly presented to mental health services at the initiation of help seeking were familial/life event problems and behavioral problems. A notable feature in the presentations was the alarming and disturbing quality of a substantial proportion of the identified problems. It is considered that the social impact of the problems is a strong precipitant in referral. The significant findings of the study are that the pathways vary by the age and sex of the adolescent, and that some presentation problems are more highly associated with particular pathways.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Child mental health services</field><field name="subject">Adolescent metal health</field><field name="subject">pathways</field><field name="subject">referral Queensland</field><field name="subject">Brisbane</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157837</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis, Modification, Characterization, and Application of MCM-41 for VOC Control.</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Xiusong</field><field name="description">The recently discovered mesoporous molecular sieve MCM-41 was synthesized, modified, and characterized and proposed as an alternative adsorbent for VOC control. The synthesis conditions for pure-silica and aluminosilicate MCM-41 were optimized as follows: 4.5Na2O:30SiO2:5.2C16H33(CH3)3N + :2500H2O and 7.5Na2O:30SiO2:xAl2O3:7.2C16H33(CH3)3N + :3500H2O (x &lt; 1), respectively, and at 373 K for 4 days. Our studies showed that MCM-41 is not stable in the presence of water vapor. For example, a hydrothermal treatment of MCM-41 at 723 K for 2 hour resulted in 50 % of structure collapses. Again, when a template-free MCM-41 sample was exposed to air with a relative humidity of 60 % for three months, almost total pore structure collapses were observed. Adsorption equilibrium results showed that MCM-41 has a narrow pore size distribution and exhibits extraordinary pore volume compared to the classical microporous adsorbents, such as molecular sieves and activated carbons. Despite the impressive adsorption capacities of this material, the Type IV isotherm behavior requires the VOCs, in the gas phase, to be at high partial pressure. This is not the case with most industrial VOC streams. A real VOC stream requires an adsorbent with not only a high adsorption capacity but also a high adsorption affinity at a low VOC concentration. To overcome the above mentioned two problems, both the surface chemistry and the pore-opening sizes of MCM-41 were modified. To modify the surface chemistry, one has to better understand the surface chemistry. Our pioneering study of the surface chemistry of MCM-41 using FTIR, 29 Si CP/MAS NMR, pyridine-TPD, and TGA demonstrated that three types of silanol groups, i.e. single, (SiO)3Si-OH, hydrogen-bonded, (SiO)3Si-OH---OH-Si(SiO)3 and geminal, (SiO)2Si(OH)2 are distributed over the surface of MCM-41. The number of silanol groups per unit nm 2 , aOH, varies between 2.5 and 3.0 depending on the template-removal method. To improve the hydrothermal stability and enhance the hydrophobicity, the surface chemistry of MCM-41 was modified by silylation. Though both the free and hydrogen-bonded SiOH groups were found to be the active sites for adsorption of pyridine with desorption energies of 91.4 and 52.2 kJ mol -1 , respectively, only the free SiOH groups are highly accessible to the silylating agent, chlorotrimethylsilane. The surface coverage of the modifying agent was found to has a linear relationship with the surface free silanol groups which can be controlled by different heating temperatures. Modification by silyaltion can significantly improve hydrophobicity and stability. Rehydration/dehydration experiments demonstrate that the surface-silylated MCM-41 is highly tolerable to water vapor due to the complete replacement of surface-hydrophilic silanols. A novel modification method, namely selective tailoring (ST), was developed to tailor the pore-opening sizes of MCM-41 (rather than the entire pores). The novelty is that only the pore mouths at both ends of a cylindrical pore of MCM-41 was modified by deposition of some alkoxides. By doing so, the types of adsorption isotherms of VOCs can be changed from Type IV to Type I while the pore volume can be significantly preserved. This is of course significance in VOC removal since the adsorption affinity has been drastically enhanced. Adsorption equilibria and kinetics for VOCs in the pore-opening-modified MCM-41 materials were measured, modeled and compared to that of activated carbons and hydrophobic molecular sieves. The pore-modified MCM-41 has a much higher adsorption capacity than that of the traditional microporous adsorbents such as activated carbons and molecular sieves. The adsorption equilibrium data fit the Langmuir-Uniform distribution (Unilan) models very well. Upon the equilibrium parameters being obtained and considering the pore structure of our pore-modified MCM-41 adsorbents, the kinetic data were further modeled using the literature-existed models recently developed by Do and coworkers, i.e. the constant surface diffusivity macropore, surface and micropore diffusion (CMSMD) model and the macropore and surface diffusion (MSD) model. Results demonstrated that the CMSMD model can predict our kinetic uptake curves reasonably fine. Some key kinetic parameters including pore and surface diffusivities, apparent diffusivity, activation energy for adsorption, and pore tortuosity factor can be readily obtained. The porosity of the MCM-41 materials were primarily evaluated using the traditional methods based on nitrogen adsorption/desorption data. Results indicated that the BJH method always underestimates the true pore diameter of MCM-41. An comparison plot (t-plot or as-plot) method was suggested and improved. Plotting of nitrogen adsorption data at 77 K versus the statistical film thickness reveals three distinct stages, with a characteristic of two points of inflection. The steep intermediate stage is caused by capillary condensation occurred in the highly uniform mesopores. From the slope of the section after condensation, the external surface area can be obtained. Therefore, the true surface area of the mesopores is readily calculated. The linear portion of the last section is extrapolated to the adsorption axis of the comparison plot, and this intercept is used to obtain the volume of the mesopores. From the surface area and pore volume, average mesopore diameter is calculated, and the value thus obtained is in good agreement with the pore dimension obtained from powder X-ray diffraction measurements. The principle of pore size calculation, the thickness of adsorbed nitrogen film, and the problems associated with the BJH method were discussed in detail. It has been found that at a given relative pressure, the smaller the pore radius, the thicker the adsorbed film. Thermodynamics analysis established that the stability of the adsorbed film is determined by interface curvature and the potential of interaction between adsorbate and adsorbent. A semi-empirical equation is proposed to describe the state of stable adsorbed films in cylindrical mesopores. It is also shown to be useful in calculations of pore size distributions of mesoporous solids. The desorption of four representative volatile organic compounds (VOCs), i.e. n-hexane, cyclohexane, benzene, and methanol from MCM-41 were also investigated and compared with the hydrophobic zeolite, silicalite-1, using the technique of temperature programmed desorption (TPD). The desorption energies of these organics to MCM-41 were evaluated and compared with the adsorption isosteric heats. The affinity of organics to MCM-41 and silicalite-1, which represents surface hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity were studied and discussed. Results showed that only one desorption peak can be found for all organics from MCM-41, different from that from the microporous adsorbents (activated carbons and hydrophobic molecular sieves). The activation energies for desorption of non-polar molecules are slightly higher than their latent heats of evaporation, whereas the activation energy for desorption of methanol is well above its latent heat of evaporation. These results are consistent with those derived from the adsorption isotherm measurements. The very high activation energy for the desorption of methanol is due to the hydrogen bonds between methanol molecules and silanol groups over MCM-41 surfaces.

But literary commentary does not act alone: it also intersects with other discursive acts that together produce a dominant ideology, participating with them in the construction of 'a particular reality'. This thesis demonstrates, for the period since 1940, how arguments about the nature of Canadian and Australian Literatures in English are part of that ideological process. It therefore interrogates the kinds of 'national interests' which the discussions of the national literatures serve. Acknowledging that such debates are conducted as being 'in the interest' of the nation but are in fact in the domain of particular institutions, it enquires into the sources and relations of power within those institutions (and other cultural formations), and the ways in which that power is enhanced by the discussions of the national literatures. While it is true that the question, 'Is there any?' continued to be used as a dismissive topos in some polemics well into the period covered, this thesis argues that in the significant debates about Australian and Canadian Literatures, and in most of the public use of them, the issues that are engaged are rather 'What is it?' and, implicitly at least, 'What may be done with/to it?' That last question discloses that the debate is about authority. The thesis argues that the attempts to define national literatures have been attempts to privilege the position of the definer.  It proposes that the visibility of national literatures, the general acknowledgement of their 'presence', depends not on the adventitious .pn iv production of particular literary works -- the epic, a 'masterpiece', the Great Canadian/Australian Novel -- or on the 'mastery' of particular literary material -- the vernacular, indigenous peoples, the natural environment -- but rather on the establishment of the institutions of literary culture. It further argues that, despite the considerable achievements of individuals, this is not a history of individual heroism any more than it is a matter of reaching a quota of quality, quantity, or content. The 'actions' of those notable individuals are subject to, and are often precipitated by, institutional, political, and economic forces such as those examined in Chapters Five and Six. One premise of this thesis is that in Post-Colonial cultures, the 'presence' of history, ideology, and discourse is especially 'marked', and that, for an understanding of the development of literary culture, an examination of the economies of public/ation, of the relation to public policy, is not only necessary but inevitable.  The proof of the existence of a national literature is, indeed, the existence of its infrastructure -- the institutions of writing, teaching, scholarship, and publishing. But a crucial cause seems to be the precipitation of a polemic -- a 'timely' debate about the literature. Equally, the maintenance of a cultural nationalism depends not on the 'existence' of a national culture but upon the promotion of a problematic -- a rhetoric of crisis. In this, Canada has been more prominent than Australia. It is worth noting that the 'crisis' in Canadian culture in the nineteen seventies was especially closely tied to the focussing upon the national in 1967 (the Centennial), upon internal threats to its survival (the 'Quebec crisis'), and the external threats to its survival (American economic domination of Canadian industry and consequently of Canadian culture): the debate about Canadian culture was a metaphor and a metonymy for each of these. While it has become axiomatic to observe that Canadian society is pluralist (the mosaic) and Australian society is assimilationist (the monolith), this thesis nevertheless shows that the coherence of Canadian society is in many ways more apparent. This is especially true of the cultural articulations of that society, its concern for principles (rather than Australian pragmatism), its impetus towards defining issues (rather than the Australian dealing with problems), and its concern with self- knowledge. However, in working comparatively with Canadian and Australian literatures this thesis departs from the customary Australian-Canadian strategy of distinguishing between the two literatures with the implied object of judging the two cultures. Its aim, rather, is to pursue an understanding of the development and workings of national literary cultures. It therefore considers not only the particular histories of literary criticism and literary history, and those of the various cultural institutions, but also endeavours to analyse their sociologies as well. The effects, then, of the particular modes of operation of the institutions (and even individuals) in Canadian and Australian literary culture upon the representation and recognition of those 'Literatures' are considered in some detail in the process of examining the range of social and cultural domains that must be analysed if the stories of national literary cultures are to be made intelligible.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Literature</field><field name="subject">Comparative -- Australian and Canadian</field><field name="subject">Canadian literature -- History and criticism</field><field name="subject">Australian literature -- History and criticism</field><field name="subject">Literature</field><field name="subject">Comparative -- Canadian and Australian</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157832</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crime in the north-west 1925-1950</field><field name="creator">Perkins, Diane Mary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">2103 Historical Studies</field><field name="subject">1602 Criminology</field><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="subject">Alcohol</field><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="subject">sex crimes</field><field name="subject">Crime -- Queensland, Northwestern -- History</field><field name="subject">Queensland, Northwestern -- History</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157830</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-Conventional Sintered Aluminium Powder Alloys</field><field name="creator">Sercombe, Timothy Barry</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to improve the properties of pressed and sintered aluminium powder alloys. This improvement was to be achieved using two methods. The first method involved the selection of an alloy system using binary aluminium phase diagrams and a knowledge of the phase diagram characteristics of ideal sintering systems. The second approach involved the judicious use of selected trace element additions to modify the sintering characteristics of aluminium and its alloys. A trace amount of magnesium was found to be critical to the sintering of aluminium powder due to its disrupting effect on the tenacious oxide layer covering the powder particles. The critical amount of Mg required to optimise both density and mechanical properties is dependent on the specific volume of oxide and the therefore particle size. The optimum concentration is 0.1-1.0wt% Mg. The Al-Sn phase diagram exhibits many of the characteristics of an ideal sintering system. Unsurprisingly, Sn was found to be an extremely efficient sintering aid, but only in the presence of Mg. Near full density parts were produced using an Al-8Sn-0.15Mg alloy in short sintering times (30 minutes). Additionally, as-sintered ductilities exceeding 20% were achieved using an Al-2Sn-0.15Mg alloy. Alloys based on the Al-Sn-Mg system lend themselves to sintering without compaction and therefore freeformed Al-Sn-Mg alloys have been produced and sintered to near full density from a starting density of ~50%. Trace amounts of Sn (Pb, In, Bi, or Sb) enhance the sintering response of an Al-4Cu-0.15Mg alloy via a vacancy binding mechanism. A similar mechanism suppresses natural ageing and stimulates artificial ageing when trace amounts of Sn are added to this alloy. A Sn-modified 2XXX series alloy has also been produced with mechanical properties nearly 20% above current commercial alloys. Along with the addition of 0.1wt%Sn, this improvement required an alteration to the solution treatment cycle which allowed the use of a higher sintering temperature without the formation of large amounts of boundary phase.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">291403 Alloy Materials</field><field name="subject">sintering aluminium</field><field name="subject">trace element effects</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157831</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficiency and equity effects of suburbanised retailing systems in Australian regional cities</field><field name="creator">Elvidge , Norman</field><field name="description">The suburban shopping centre has become part of the urban landscape of Australia over the past 40 years. From their initial point of innovation in the capital cities, suburban centres diffused rapidly through the urban system. The majority of the 26 regional cities identified in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania have at least one centre, and in some the extent of suburbanisation has eclipsed the traditional central business area as the prime focus of retail activity. The advent of suburbanised shopping systems also highlights the partial demise of a locally-owned competitive capitalist sub-mode of activity and its replacement by a competitive oligopolistic capitalist sub-mode involving nationally-based firms. As with any change, the shifts in location, ownership and method of operation associated with the growth of suburbanised retailing systems have the capacity to bring about changes in the efficiency and equity of regional cities. Although it is not possible to prove conclusively that the efficiency of retail operations is improved by the growth of suburban centres, the advent of a system which encourages competition between retail firms appears to result in lower prices. Access to retail facilities is also potentially improved for a significant proportion of the populations of regional cities, although comparison shopping between centres might also generate increased cross-city flows of traffic. However, equity is not necessarily increased by these changes. Although the accessibility of lower income, elderly and less mobile households is improved, changes in the location of retailing favour younger, more affluent and mobile shoppers to a greater extent. And although the developers and owners of suburban shopping centres meet many of their own costs, there is evidence that they do not contribute to local government rate revenues to a level commensurate with their turnover and profits. On the other hand, the local authority is often faced with the demands of central business area property owners and retailers to revitalise their section of the city, bringing about an effective transfer of funds from the public to the private sector. The result may well be a net decrease in equity. Under pressure from local business interests, some city councils have chosen to restrict the pace of retail suburbanisation, whilst others have chosen to allow market forces to take their course.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stores</field><field name="subject">retail</field><field name="subject">planning</field><field name="subject">retail trade</field><field name="subject">shopping centers</field><field name="subject">provincial cities</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157829</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure Based Development of Antiviral Drugs Targeting the Dengue Virus Fusion Mechanism</field><field name="creator">Kampmann, Thorsten</field><field name="description">Flaviviruses, particularly dengue virus are a major public health problem in tropical and subtropical areas of the world with up to 100 million people infected annually. Infection with dengue can result in acute and potentially fatal haemorrhagic fever with the incidence of these diseases having increased over the last two decades. Currently, there are no therapeutic agents available for treating flavivirus infections and the identification of our lead compounds is a first step toward their development. This thesis focuses on the dengue virus fusion mechanism as a target for drug development. Novel lead compounds were identified using virtual screening against the dengue virus E protein and rational design of E and prM derived peptide fusion inhibitors. To gain insight into the molecular mechanism of viral membrane fusion and to identify new avenues for antiviral design a detailed analysis was performed of the sequences and structures of viral fusion proteins from different families. Small molecules were successfully identified and tested which inhibit the dengue virus fusion mechanism, a process essential for viral infection of cells. The compounds were identified by in silico docking of a compound library against the dengue virus envelope (E) protein and are assumed to inhibit the transition of the E protein from its metastable pre-fusion form to its stable post-fusion form. We tested the compounds in viral proliferation (plaque) and cell cytotoxicity (MTT) assays and identified several compounds with an IC50 of 1-50 &#956;M and no mammalian cell cytotoxicity. These lead compounds are now undergoing further studies for the development of a dengue virus fusion inhibitor. Furthermore, these lead compounds are active against the flavivirus family members Kunjun virus and Yellow fever virus. The high conservation of E protein structural elements amongst the flaviviruses suggests that these compounds may also serve as leads for the development of fusion inhibitors against other members of the flavivirus family, for example West Nile virus and Japanese encephalitis virus. Peptide dengue virus fusion inhibitors were rationally designed based on previous experimental data and on the analysis of the interactions of the prM and E protein in immature dengue virus particles. The peptides were expressed and purified, their assays. One peptide fusion inhibitor was identified with an IC50 of about 100 &#956;M. The analysis of sequence and structural features of the influenza virus HA and dengue virus E proteins from multiple viral strains suggests that low pH-mediated viral fusion is initiated by histidine protonation. Highly conserved histidine residues are buried in conserved pockets in the pre-fusion forms of the dengue virus E and influenza HA protein. In the post-fusion forms, the presumably protonated histidines form ionic interactions with new residue partners. This suggests that protonation of the histidines in the low pH environment of the endosome provides the free energy to release the histidines from their binding pocket and drives the structural changes in the fusion protein necessary for membrane fusion. This model is supported by preliminary experimental data and molecular dynamics studies simulating the low pH conditions. A clearer understanding of the detailed molecular events driving viral fusion provides valuable targets for the rational design of small molecule inhibitors and provides directions for the construction of attenuated infectious clone mutants that could serve as future vaccine candidates.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158818</field></doc><doc><field name="title">GENETIC DIVERSITY AND VARIABILITY IN GRAIN QUALITY OF SORGHUM (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) LANDRACES FROM NORTHEASTERN ETHIOPIA</field><field name="creator">Desmae, Hailemichael</field><field name="description">Plant genetic resources are invaluable inputs for sustaining and improving agricultural productivity. The collection and conservation of genetic diversity of important food crops has been given significant focus due to concerns over loss of genetic resources. Characterization of available diversity and chronological monitoring of the population conserved is important to understand the dynamics of genetic resources. The main aim of the present study was to assess the extent and structure of variability in sorghum landraces from North Eastern Ethiopia, and investigate the changes in variability over years. The extent and structure of variability in sorghum landraces obtained from IBC and farmers fields was assessed using morphological, SSR and ISSR markers. A wide range of variability was observed, and the analysis of variance showed significant differences in both among landraces and among geographic domains for all quantitative traits. The distribution of phenotypic classes of qualitative traits showed that non-juicy types (92%), awns at maturity (67%), white midrib color (72%), grey and straw glume color (63%), semi-compact to compact head types (68%), mostly starchy and completely starchy (82%), and 25% grain covered with glume (90%) characterize the majority of landraces. White, red, light red, straw, yellow, and brown seed colors were important accounting for more than 81% of the landraces. The Shannon-Weaver diversity index for qualitative traits ranged from 0.30 to 0.93 (mean = 0.67) for grain covering and grain color, respectively. All seven SSR primer pairs generated high levels of polymorphism, and a total of 106 alleles (15.1 alleles per locus) were observed across the landraces. The gene diversity for the entire landraces ranged from 0.52 (sbKAFGK-I) to 0.85 (sb4-32) with mean 0.72. For ISSRs, a high number of bands ranging from 34 to 87 were generated with 162 bands in total. The gene diversity ranged from 0.82 (FISSR 6) to 0.90 (FISSR 2 and 7). Cluster analyses showed no distinct pattern in the clustering of landraces based on geographic origin. The differentiation of landraces among geographic domains based on qualitative traits appeared to be weak where 97% and 95% of the variation was accounted for by within zone and altitude variation, respectively. Relatively higher differentiation (14%) was observed between districts. Similarly, no strong genetic differentiation among landraces was observed between the different geographical domains based on SSR markers. Comparison of the morphological and molecular marker systems showed that the similarity coefficients were substantially different, with SSRs displaying the lowest similarity value (0.19) while similarity in terms of qualitative traits was relatively high (0.49). No strong correlation was observed between similarity matrices, and the clustering of the landraces was different for the different marker systems. A farm survey was performed, and morphological and molecular evaluations of landraces collected in 1973 and 2003 were performed to understand the trend of the landraces variability over years. Preliminary analysis of the farm survey indicates that some important landraces have disappeared either locally or regionally in the past 30 years and many other landraces have become marginalized. Landraces which are less preferred in terms of agronomic value and end-use and some new introductions have become increasingly important. Farmers have become more risk averse, and factors such as declining soil fertility, more frequent drought and unreliable rainfall, and increased pest infestation have contributed to a change in farmer landrace selection. The field evaluation showed significant variability between the two collections for quantitative traits. For example, the landraces from the 1973 collection were late maturing compared to the 2003 collection. Little difference was, however, observed in overall variability in terms of both morphological and molecular diversity indices. Some alleles have been lost over years, but new alleles were also gained at the same time. The cloning and characterization of opaque-2 gene has been discussed in relation to available resources. High homologies were observed for nucleotide and protein sequences from the data base. Expression analysis revealed substantial differences among sorghum landraces. Protein and starch analyses for selected landraces and their starch gelatinization behaviour displayed substantial differences. Over all, the present study confirmed the presence of appreciable variability among sorghum landraces from North Eastern Ethiopia. Both the morphological and molecular diversity analyses as well as the protein and starch analysis revealed high variability. The importance of this variability and implications for conservation are discussed; and suggestions are made.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158789</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computational Optimization of Scramjets and Shock Tunnel Nozzles</field><field name="creator">Craddock, Christopher S.</field><field name="description">The design of supersonic flow paths for scramjet engines and high Mach number shock tunnel nozzles is complicated by high temperature flow effects and multidimensional inviscid/ viscous flow interactions. Due to these complications, design in the past has been enabled by making flow modelling simplifications that detract from the accuracy of the flow analysis. A relatively new approach to designing aerodynamic bodies, which automates design and does not require as many simplifying assumptions to be effective, is the coupling of a computational flow solver to an optimization algorithm. In this study, a new three-dimensional space-marching computational flow solver is developed and coupled to a gradient-search optimization algorithm. This new design tool is then used for the design optimization of an axisymmetric scramjet flow path and two high Mach number shock tunnel nozzles. The flow solver used in the design tool is an explicit, upwind, space-marching, finite-volume solver for integrating the three-dimensional parabolized Navier-Stokes equations. It is developed with an emphasis on simplicity and efficiency. Cross-stream fluxes are calculated using Toro's efficient upwind, linearized, approximate Riemann solver in flow regions of slowly varying data, and an Osher type solver in the remainder of the flow. Vigneron's technique of splitting the streamwise pressure gradient in subsonic regions is used to stabilise the flux calculations. A three-dimensional implementation of an algebraic turbulence model, a finite-rate chemistry model and a thermodynamic equilibrium model are also implemented within the solver. A range of test cases is performed to (1) validate and verify the phenomenological models implemented within the solver, thereby ensuring the simulation results used for design are credible, and (2) demonstrate the speed of the solver. The first application of the new computational design tool is the design of a scramjet flow path, which is optimized for maximum axial thrust at a flight Mach number of 12. The optimization of a scramjet flow path has been examined previously, however, this study differs to others published in that the flow is modelled using a turbulence model and a finite-rate chemical reaction model which add to the fidelity of the simulations. The external shape of the scramjet vehicle is constrained early on in the design process, therefore, the design of the scramjet is restricted to the internal flow path. Because of this constraint, and the large internal surface area of the combustor and the high skin friction iv within the combustor, the net calculated force exerted on the scramjet for both the initial and optimized design is a drag force. The drag force of the initial design, however, is reduced by 60% through optimization.  The second application of the design tool is the wall contour of an axisymmetric Mach 7 shock tunnel nozzle, which is computationally optimized for minimum test core flow variation to a level of +/- 0.019 degrees for the flow angularity and +/- 0.26% for the Pitot pressure. The design is verified by constructing a nozzle with the optimized wall contour and conducting experimental Pitot surveys of the nozzle exit flow. The measured standard deviation in core flow Pitot pressure is 1.6%. However, because there is a large amount of experimental noise, it is expected that the actual core flow uniformity may be better than indicated by the raw experimental data.  The last application of the computational design tool is a contoured Mach 7 square cross-section shock tunnel nozzle. This is a three-dimensional optimization problem that demonstrates the versatility of the design tool, since the effort required to implement the optimization algorithm is independent of the complexity of the flow-field and flow solver. Optimization results show that the variation in the test core flow properties could only be reduced to a Mach number variation of +/- 7% and flow angle variation of +/- 1.2 degrees ,for a short nozzle suitable for a shock tunnel. The magnitudes of the optimized nozzle exit flow deviations for the short nozzle and two other longer nozzles indicate that generating uniform flow becomes increasingly difficult as the length of square cross-section nozzles is reduced. Overall, the current research shows that coupling a flow solver to an optimization algorithm is an effective and insightful way of designing scramjets and shock tunnel nozzles.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nozzles</field><field name="subject">scramjets</field><field name="subject">computational fluid dynamics (CFD)</field><field name="subject">optimization</field><field name="subject">scock tunnels</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157835</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical simulation of diaphragm rupture</field><field name="creator">Petrie-Repar, Paul J</field><field name="description">The results from computer simulations of the gas-dynamic processes that occur during and after the rupture of diaphragms within shock tubes and expansion tubes are presented. A two-dimensional and axisymmetric finite-volume code that solves the unsteady Euler equations for inviscid compressible flow, was used to perform the simulations. The flow domains were represented as unstructured meshes of triangular cells and solution-adaptive remeshing was used to focus computational effort in regions where the flow-field gradients were high.  The ability of the code to produce accurate solutions to the Euler equations was verified by examining the following test cases: supersonic vortex flow between two arcs, an ideal shock tube, and supersonic flow over a cone. The ideal shock tube problem was studied in detail, in particular the shock speed. The computed shock speed was accurate when the initial pressure ratio was low. When the initial pressure ratio was high the ow was dificult to resolve because of the large density ratio at the contact surface where significant numerical diffusion occurred. However, solution- adaptive remeshing was used to control the error and reasonable estimates for the shock speed were obtained.  The code was used to perform multi-dimensional simulations of the gradual opening of a primary diaphragm within a shock tube. The development of the flow, in particular the contact surface was examined and found to be strongly dependent on the initial pressure ratio across the diaphragm.  For high initial pressure ratios across the diaphragm, previous experiments have shown that the measured shock speed can exceed the shock speed predicted by one- dimensional models. The shock speeds computed via the present multi-dimensional simulation were higher than those estimated by previous one-dimensional models and were closer to the experimental measurements. This indicates that multi- dimensional ow effects were partly responsible for the relatively high shock speeds measured in the experiments.  The code also has the ability to simulate two-dimensional fluid-structure interac- tions. To achieve this the Euler equations are solved for a general moving frame of reference. Mesh management during a simulation is important. This includes the ability to automatically generate a new mesh when the current mesh becomes distorted (due to the motion of the structures) and the transfer of the solution from the old mesh to the new.  The shock induced rupture of thin diaphragms was examined. Previous one dimen- sional models are awed because they do not simultaneously consider the diaphragm mass and allow the upstream gas to penetrate the diaphragm mass. Two multi- dimensional models which allow the upstream gas to penetrate are described. The first model assumes the diaphragm vaporises immediately after the arrival of the incident shock. The second model assumes the diaphragm shatters into a number of pieces which can be treated as rigid bodies. The results from both models are compared with experimental data.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Diaphragm rupture</field><field name="subject">shock tunnels</field><field name="subject">expansion tubes</field><field name="subject">unstructured grids</field><field name="subject">shock speed</field><field name="subject">contact surface</field><field name="subject">solution adaptive remeshing</field><field name="subject">moving grids</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157839</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antigenic, genetic and biological characterization of the flavivirus Alfuy.</field><field name="creator">May, Fiona J.</field><field name="description">Alfuy virus (ALFV) is a member of the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) antigenic complex of flaviviruses and is currently classified as a subtype of Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV). However, while MVEV and JEV pose significant health risks to regions of Northern Australia, there is little evidence that ALFV causes disease in humans or other animals. Due to the apparent low pathogenicity of ALFV, few studies have previously focused on this virus, therefore, very little is known about it. This thesis aims to improve our understanding of this virus, with the potential of using ALFV, or markers of attenuation discovered within its genome, to develop novel vaccines for use against MVEV, JEV, and even other members of the Flavivirus genus. Previously, nucleotide sequence analysis of a small portion of the genome of ALFV was used to reclassify the virus as a subtype of MVEV. During this project the entire genome of ALFV was sequenced and compared with other members of the genus. Phylogenetic relationships revealed that although ALFV is closely related to MVEV, it is no closer to MVEV than to JEV or to Usutu virus, suggesting that ALFV should not be classed as a subtype of MVEV. Indeed, antigenic studies comparing ALFV, MVEV and JEV, using mAbs produced to MVEV, show a distinct antigenic profile for ALFV. Several unique genetic markers that may affect the virulence of ALFV were observed in the genome. Within the envelope (E) protein, the conserved Nlinked glycosylation motif contained a substitution causing a loss of glycosylation. Also within the E protein, the hinge region, involved in low-pH dependent conformational changes in the protein, also showed several amino acid differences when compared with MVEV and other related viruses. In addition, the highly conserved terminal dinucleotide was deleted. This region is thought to be important for replication of viral RNA. Virulence studies of different strains of ALFV in three-week old Swiss outbred mice also show a different pattern of virulence to MVEV. While MVEV is highly neurovirulent and neuroinvasive in these animals, ALFV exhibits weak neuroinvasiveness, producing very little disease in mice infected intraperitoneally, and producing ALFV-specific antibody only in mice infected with high doses. Even in the highly susceptible IFN-alphaR-/- mice (deficient in the receptor for interferon-alpha), ALFV caused significantly delayed mortality. This data suggests that ALFV is inefficient at replicating in the periphery of these animals. ALFV also exhibited a different tropism to MVEV in vitro, showing significantly reduced replication in Vero cells, a line of African Green Monkey kidney cells that supports efficient replication of all other members of the JEV complex. Binding studies showed that ALFV was able to bind to the surface of these cells, but electroporation of viral RNA directly into the cytoplasm was unable to initiate infection, suggesting inefficient replication or translation of ALFV viral RNA in this cell type. To determine the motifs responsible for these unique phenotypic characteristics of ALFV, three chimeric viruses were engineered based on a previously constructed infectious clone of MVEV. One, containing the structural (prM and E) genes of ALFV in the MVEV backbone, exhibited weak neuroinvasiveness, similar to ALFV, but unlike ALFV, was able to replicate efficiently in Vero cells, and produced ALFVspecific antibody in mice infected with low viral doses. This suggests that the structural genes of ALFV are associated with poor neuroinvasion, but are not responsible for poor extraneural replication in mice, or lack of growth in Vero cells. Another mutant virus was constructed by deleting the terminal dinucleotide in the MVEV infectious clone. This clone spontaneously reverted to the wild type sequence, preventing phenotypic analysis of this mutation. The final chimera contained the nonstructural genes of ALFV with the structural genes and the UTRs of MVEV. Unfortunately, despite several attempts, this clone was unstable in the bacterial host, and insertions or deletions were spontaneously introduced into the genome. Based on phylogenetic, antigenic and virulence data, ALFV is sufficiently different from MVEV to be classified as a separate virus within the genus. Determinants of the low neuroinvasiveness of ALFV have been localized to the structural genes of ALFV, probably within the hinge region of E, and/or due to the lack of glycosylation of the E protein. The cause of the delayed growth in Vero cells was unable to be determined, but is not due to a motif within the structural genes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270206 Genetic Immunology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158119</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of bovine colostrum supplementation on immune variables and exercise performance in trained cyclists</field><field name="creator">Shing, Cecilia Mary</field><field name="description">Bovine colostrum is homologous in composition to human colostrum but contains greater concentrations of key bioactive components that contribute directly to growth and immunity. It has been used by humans to treat and prevent enteric pathogens and to promote wound healing and intestinal repair. Moreover, bovine colostrum has been promoted and used by athletes as a supplement to enhance immune function and improve exercise performance. This is despite limited data in support of its value to athletes and the relative absence of strong data that identify mechanisms that could improve exercise performance and immune function. The aim of the three studies that comprise this thesis was therefore to investigate the influence of a bovine colostrum protein concentrate (CPC) on immune variables, hormone concentrations, autonomic activity and exercise performance in highly-trained endurance cyclists. Study one involved monitoring exercise performance and immune variables during an eight week bovine CPC supplementation period, which included five consecutive days of high-intensity training (HIT). Twenty-nine highly-trained male road cyclists completed an initial 40-km time trial (TT40) and were then randomly assigned to either a supplement (n=14, 10 g bovine CPC per day) or placebo group (n=15, 10 g whey protein concentrate per day). Following five weeks of supplementation, the cyclists completed a second TT40 before undertaking five consecutive days of high-intensity training (HIT) that included another TT40. A final TT40 was completed one week following the HIT. Venous blood and saliva samples were collected immediately before and after each TT40, and upper respiratory illness symptoms were recorded over the experimental period. Supplementation with bovine CPC elicited improvements in TT40 performance at the end of the HIT period, when compared to the placebo group, (1.9&#177;2.2%; mean&#177;90% confidence limits) and maintained ventilatory threshold following the HIT (4.6&#177;4.6%). When compared to the placebo group, bovine CPC supplementation significantly increased pre-exercise serum soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 during the HIT period (p&lt;0.039). Supplementation also suppressed the post-exercise decrease in cytotoxic/suppressor T cells during the HIT period (bovine CPC=-Bovine colostrum is homologous in composition to human colostrum but contains greater concentrations of key bioactive components that contribute directly to growth and immunity.

Moreover, bovine colostrum has been promoted and used by athletes as a supplement to enhance immune function and improve exercise performance. This is despite limited data in support of its value to athletes and the relative absence of strong data that identify mechanisms that could improve exercise performance and immune function. The aim of the three studies that comprise this thesis was therefore to investigate the influence of a bovine colostrum protein concentrate (CPC) on immune variables, hormone concentrations, autonomic activity and exercise performance in highly-trained endurance cyclists. Study one involved monitoring exercise performance and immune variables during an eight week bovine CPC supplementation period, which included five consecutive days of high-intensity training (HIT). Twenty-nine highly-trained male road cyclists completed an initial 40-km time trial (TT40) and were then randomly assigned to either a supplement (n=14, 10 g bovine CPC per day) or placebo group (n=15, 10 g whey protein concentrate per day). Following five weeks of supplementation, the cyclists completed a second TT40 before undertaking five consecutive days of high-intensity training (HIT) that included another TT40. A final TT40 was completed one week following the HIT. Venous blood and saliva samples were collected immediately before and after each TT40, and upper respiratory illness symptoms were recorded over the experimental period. Supplementation with bovine CPC elicited improvements in TT40 performance at the end of the HIT period, when compared to the placebo group, (1.9&#177;2.2%; mean&#177;90% confidence limits) and maintained ventilatory threshold following the HIT (4.6&#177;4.6%). When compared to the placebo group, bovine CPC supplementation significantly increased pre-exercise serum soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 during the HIT period (p&lt;0.039). Supplementation also suppressed the post-exercise decrease in cytotoxic/suppressor T cells during the HIT period (bovine CPC=- 1.0&#177;2.7%, placebo=-9.2&#177;2.8%; mean&#177;SE, p=0.017) and during the following week (bovine CPC=1.4&#177;2.9%, placebo=-8.2&#177;2.8%, p=0.004). In addition, bovine CPC supplementation prevented a post-exercise decrease in serum IgG2 concentration at the end of the HIT period (bovine CPC=4.8&#177;6.8%, p=0.88; placebo=-9.7&#177;6.9%, p=0.013) and there was a trend towards reduced incidence of upper respiratory illness symptoms in the bovine CPC group (p=0.055). Study one demonstrated that low dose bovine CPC supplementation elicited improvements in TT40 performance during a HIT period and maintained ventilatory threshold following five consecutive days of HIT. Supplementation was also found to modulate immune variables during normal training and following an acute period of intense exercise, which may have contributed to the trend toward reduced upper respiratory illness in the bovine CPC group. The maintenance of performance, prevention of post-exercise suppression of IgG2 and cytotoxic/suppressor T cells and increase in anti-inflammatory serum soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 suggest that bovine CPC supplementation is beneficial to cyclists during a period of high-intensity training. The aim of Study two was to investigate the hormonal, immune and autonomic responses of competitive cyclists over a five-day stage race following eight weeks of bovine CPC supplementation. Ten highly-trained male road cyclists were randomly assigned to a placebo (n=6, 10 g whey protein concentrate/day) or bovine CPC group (n=4, 10 g bovine CPC/day). Cyclists provided a baseline saliva sample before commencing supplementation that culminated in a five day competitive cycle race. The cyclists provided daily saliva samples and heart rate variability (HRV) was measured on each day of the race. A Profile of Mood States questionnaire was completed on days one, three and five of the race and cyclists recorded upper respiratory illness symptoms throughout the experimental period. While there was no influence of bovine CPC on salivary IgA, supplementation maintained testosterone concentrations over the competition period (p&lt;0.05) and prevented a decrease in parasympathetic activity (p&lt;0.05). There was also a trend towards improved mood state (p=0.06) in the bovine CPC group. These data indicate that bovine CPC supplementation may prevent disturbances in autonomic function and the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis associated with consecutive days of cycle racing The aim of study three was to assess whether bovine CPC would directly stimulate cytokine production of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), with and without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was added to cell cultures as a potent enhancer of monocyte and macrophage cytokine release and a model of exercise stress. Phytohemagglutinin was added to PBMC to stimulate T cell proliferation. Blood was sampled from four healthy, male endurance cyclists who had abstained from exercise for 48 hours. PBMC were separated and cultured with bovine CPC concentrations of 0 (control), 1.25, 2.5 and 5% with and without LPS (3&#181;g&#183;mL-1) and PHA (2.5&#181;g&#183;mL-1). Cell supernatants were collected at 6 and 24 hours of culture for the determination of tumour necrosis factor (TNF), interferon (IFN)-y, interleukin (IL)-10, IL-6, IL-4 and IL-2 concentrations. Following six hours of PBMC incubation at 37&#176;C with 5% CO2, IFN-y, IL-10 and IL-2 secretion were increased with increasing concentrations of bovine CPC (p&lt;0.05). In a dose dependent manner, IFN-y and IL-2 remained elevated following 24 hours of incubation (p&lt;0.05). Data from this final study showed that bovine CPC modulates in vitro cytokine production of human PBMC. In conclusion, the present data suggest that bovine CPC supplementation is beneficial to highlytrained cyclists during periods of high-intensity training and competition. Bovine CPC promotes the release of cell mediated cytokines from PBMC and has the potential therefore to influence a number of physiological systems. Supplementation was associated with enhanced recovery over consecutive days of high-intensity training and competition, as evidenced by maintained exercise performance, ventilatory threshold and testosterone concentrations. Bovine CPC modulated immune function, particularly at the end of a HIT period, and there was a trend for reduced incidence of upper respiratory symptoms following bovine CPC supplementation in Study one. The data collectively suggest that bovine CPC supplementation may influence a combination of physiological pathways including the autonomic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321401 Exercise Physiology</field><field name="subject">750203 Organised sports</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Joint modelling of spatial variability and interplot competition to improve the efficiency of plant improvement.</field><field name="creator">Stringer, Joanne Kay</field><field name="description">Australian sugarcane breeding trials, many varieties are tested in the early stages of selection. Small single-drill plots are typically used because of the limitations on seedcane and space. Such trials may he subject to variation arising from spatial variability and interplot competition, which could seriously bias varietal estimates and reduce genetic progress. Test varieties in early stage sugarcane trials are routinely selected using an index calculated from cane yield and sucrose content relative to commercial varieties. This selection index is based on the paradigm of positive dependence between neighbouring plots but this may not hold in the presence of interplot competition. Although this selection index may be useful in detecting broad trends in the field, variation often occurs on a much smaller scale. Methods such as spatial analysis adjust a plot for variability by using information from immediate neighbours. These techniques are routinely used to analyse cereal data in Australia and have resulted in increased accuracy and precision in the estimates of variety effects. Spatial analysis methods were applied to 28 early generation sugarcane trials. These analyses showed large global trend (fixed linear column and random row effects) and extraneous variation for cane yield and sucrose content. Removal of this variability through appropriate modelling techniques resulted in large differences in varieties ranked in the top 10% for the spatial and routine methods. Most trials also showed substantial interplot competition for cane yield, but not for sucrose content. Given the presence of significant spatial variability and interplot competition in early stage sugarcane trials, the challenge was to effectively model both spatial variability and interplot competition and hence improve genetic gain by improving the accuracy of prediction of genetic effects. The immediate consequence of not modelling interplot competition would be that Australian sugarcane breeders may select varieties that perform well in mixed, rather than pure stands. In this thesis, an approach to the simultaneous modelling of spatial variability and interplot competition is presented. This approach allows for competition at the phenotypic and genotypic (or treatment) levels and models global trend and extraneous variation. Variety effects were considered random and both adjusted profile likelihood and residual maximum likelihood based on a transformation of the data were used for parameter estimation. A simulation study was undertaken to determine the level of bias in parameter estimates for the two different methods of estimation. As previous approaches to joint modelling of spatial variability and interplot competition by Durbgn Reguera (1998), Durban et al. (2001) and Matassa (2003) had considered varieties fixed it was important to determine if the level of bias in parameters of interest changed for random varieties. It was found that adjusted profile likelihood had a low relative bias regardless of fixed or random variety effects. However, restricted maximum likelihood based on a transformation of the data can only be used when varieties are random. It was also found that the variance structure for the residuals may be complex and can be modelled using stationary conditional autoregressive processes and two special simultaneous autoregressive models. An equal roots second order autoregressive model was proposed for trials where competition was dominant, while an equal roots third order autoregressive model allowed for a mixture of competition and trend. The joint modelling approach developed in this thesis was applied to cane yield data from 22 datasets. In the majority of these, modelling competition at the genotypic level was the superior method. To determine the effect of simultaneously adjusting for spatial variability and interplot competition on selection, the percentages of superior varieties in common in the top 10% for the joint model and classical approaches were compared. Agreement between the two approaches varied from 38% to 90%. Hence, for some trials there are large differences in the varieties selected to advance to the next stage of selection. To confirm the impact on selection of adjusting for spatial variability and interplot competition, trials have now been planted which directly compare cane yield and sucrose content in varieties selected using the current and new techniques.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158244</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A novel liposaccharide system for the delivery of endomorphin-1 across the blood-brain barrier</field><field name="creator">Koda, Yasuko</field><field name="description">The endogenous opioid peptide endomorphin-1 (Endo-1; Tyr-Pro-Trp-Phe-NH2) was isolated from mammalian brain tissue by Zadina et.al. in 1997. This naturally occurring peptide exhibits high selectivity and affinity for the &#181;-opioid receptor and its efficacy as a &#181;-opioid agonist has been shown in vivo and in vitro as similar to or higher than that of morphine. The ability to use these endogenous opioid ligands as biologically available pain relief could redefine pain management by offering potent analgesia with potentially minimal side effects. However, the significant therapeutic potential of endogenous opioid peptides is hampered by their poor metabolic stability and permeability cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and gastrointestinal (GI) tract in the case of oral administration. In order to improve bioavailability, chemical modifications of Endo-1 bearing a variety of lipids and sugars at the N-/C-terminus and unique peptides incorporating 2',6'- dimethyl-L-tyrosine (DMT) in place of the Tyr residue of Endo-1 were designed and synthesized. These analogues were evaluated for bioavailability using Caco-2 cells and pharmacological efficacy using SH-SY5Y cells in in vitro studies. The most promising compound was selected for in vivo biodistribution studies which were performed using intra venous (i.v.) injection and oral administration in adult male Sprague-Dawley (S.D.) rats. All results were compared to the native peptide Endo-1. Enzymatic stability assays using Caco-2 cell homogenates showed lipoamino acids and glucose succinate conjugated at N-terminus of Endo-1 analogues exhibited great stability with approximately 5-15 fold longer half lives than Endo-1 (t1/2=5.5 minutes). The stable in metabolic enzymes, lipophilic analogue C8-lipoamino acid conjugate (C8Laa-Endo-1) exhibited high apparent permeability (Papp= 3.54 &#215; 10-6 cm/s) through Caco-2 cell monolayers. Conjugates with increased alkyl chain length Laas (carbon atom number of C12 and C18) conjugated to Endo-1 exhibited poor solubility, thus C12Laa-Endo-1 was subjected to various formulation studies achieving 87% liposome encapsulation using hydration of freeze-dried monophase method of preparation. Liposome formulated C12Laa-Endo-1 showed improved water solubility and exhibited significant enzymatic stability and high permeability. Chemically modified Endo-1 analogues were also assessed for opioid receptor binding affinity and functional efficacy using human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells that express &#181;- and s-opioid receptors. Modification of the C-terminus of Endo-1 caused a severe drop in affinity for the &#181;- and s-opioid receptors, whereas N-terminal modified compounds exhibited small decreases in affinity. Analogues bearing both DMT and C8Laa conjugated at N-terminus exhibited 20-25 fold greater binding affinity than the native peptide Endo-1. The rank order of inhibition of forskolin-stimulated c-AMP accumulation was similar to receptor binding affinities. The IC50 of (DMT)1-Endo-1 and C8Laa-(DMT)1-Endo-1 was 0.43 and 0.32 nM respectively compared to 14 nM for Endo-1. The substitution of DMT in the place of Tyr residue exhibits great enhancement of these opioid activities. An in vivo study of the biodistribution of C8Laa-Endo-1 was carried out with i.v. injection and oral administration. The distribution study required N-terminal [3H]- acetylation of both Endo-1 as control and C8Laa-Endo-1. A variety of organs were taken at certain time points (15, 30 and 60 minutes) and the [3H] levels measured. C8Laa-Endo-1 showed approximately 10% uptake in the brain at 15 minutes post i.v. injection. After oral administration, C8Laa-Endo-1 accumulated in the small intestine more than Endo-1. Endo-1 was observed more in the liver than C8Laa-Endo-1 over experimental time points following i.v. injection and oral administration suggesting that Endo-1 may be metabolized via first pass metabolism in the liver. In conclusion, N-terminal modifications improved enzymatic stability and cell monolayer permeability in Caco-2 cells assays. Opioid agonist activities in SHSY5Ycells confirmed that an unencumbered C-terminus was essential for Endo-1 pharmacological activity. Furthermore, DMT incorporation at Tyr residue of Endo-1 enhanced opioid agonist activity.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158354</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nitrene Rearrangements: Formation of Reactive Intermediates and Unusual Molecules</field><field name="creator">Kvaskoff, David</field><field name="description">The three parts of this thesis describe the spectroscopic investigations and theoretical methods which illustrate the rearrangements of some nitrenes derived from azides and heterocyclic compounds. In the first part, alkyl- and aryl-iminopropadienethiones 2 have been generated by flash vacuum thermolysis of isoxazolones derivatives 25, and characterised by mass spectrometry and matrix isolation IR spectroscopy in conjunction with DFT calculations and chemical trapping. The thermal fragmentation of 25 was investigated by following the differential growth of intermediates observed at different FVT temperatures and two major routes were identified depending on the reaction conditions: Sequential elimination of propene and isopropylthiol from the FVT of 25 at 500-600&#176;C afforded an intermediate thioketene 30, which was characterised by IR spectroscopy and trappable with aliphatic amines to give the corresponding thioamides 43. In contrast, the intermediates characterised by mass spectrometry in the same temperature range indicated the initial loss of propene, followed by ring opening of the isoxazolone and decarboxylation, and above 700&#176;C, further loss of propene and hydrogen sulphide to eventually give 2. The use of a carrier gas in the matrix isolation experiments was shown to account for the discrepancies observed in the FVT / IR and FVT / MS studies, as a result of the chemical deactivation of the intermediate 30. Decomposition of 25 may follow a series of favourable [4n+2] electrocyclic eliminations. Above 700&#176;C, FVT / IR of 25a-c afforded 2a-c, whereas 25d-e gave (alkyl)cyanothioketenes 40d-e predominantly, which was consistent with the divergent behaviour of transient nitrene 31 with respect to the alkyl and aryl derivatives. Trapping of 25a-c in the gas phase with amines afforded 2-substituted thioquinolones 44a-c. The reaction was monitored by IR spectroscopy and revealed the formation of a 1:1 complex of the iminopropadienethione with trimethylamine, while a zwitterion was observed with dimethylamine. The formation of thioquinolones involves the electrocyclisation of an intermediate imidoylthioketene which is in fast equilibrium with the corresponding thioxoketenimine. The facile 1,3-migration of the amino group was supported by DFT calculations. The second part details the rearrangement of 6-phenanthridylcarbene to 9-phenanthrylnitrene. The flash vacuum thermolysis (FVT) of 9-azidophenanthrene 8, 6-(5-tetrazolyl)-phenanthridine 18, and [1,2,3]triazolo[1,5-f]phenanthridine 19 yields 9-cyanofluorene 12 as the principal product and 4-cyanofluorene as a minor product. In all cases, when the product is condensed at or below 77 K, the seven-membered ring ketenimine 24 is detectable by IR spectroscopy (1932 cm-1) up to 200 K. Photolysis of Ar matrix isolated 8 at O= 308 or 313 nm generates at first the azirine 26, rapidly followed by the ylidic cumulene 27. The latter reverts to azirine 26 at O&gt; 405 nm, and the azirine reverts to the ylidic cumulene at 313 nm. Nitrene 9 is observed by ESR spectroscopy following FVT of either azide 8, tetrazole 18, or triazole 19 with Ar matrix isolation of the products. Nitrene 9 and carbene 21 are observed by ESR spectroscopy in the Ar matrix photolyses of azide 8 and triazole 19, respectively. In the third part, tetrazolo[1,5-a]quinazoline (9) is converted to 2-azidoquinazoline (10) on sublimation at 200 &#176;C and above, and the azide-tetrazole equilibrium is governed by entropy. 2-Quinazolylnitrenes 11 and 27 and/or their ring expansion products 14 and 29 can undergo type I (ylidic) and type II (diradicaloid) ring opening. Argon matrix photolysis of 9/10 affords 2-quinazolylnitrene (11), which has been characterized by ESR, UV, and IR spectroscopy. A minor amount of a second nitrene, formed by rearrangement or ring opening, is also observed. A diradical (19) is formed rapidly by type II ring opening and characterized by ESR spectroscopy; it decays thermally at 15 K with a half-life of ca. 47 min, in agreement with its calculated facile intersystem crossing (19T --&gt; 19OSS) followed by facile cyclization/rearrangement to 1-cyanoindazole (21) (calculated activation barrier 1-2 kcal/mol) and N-cyanoanthranilonitrile (22). 21 and 22 are the isolated end products of photolysis. 21 is also the end product of flash vacuum thermolysis. An excellent linear correlation between the zero-field splitting parameter D (cm-1) and the spin density F on the nitrene N calculated at the B3LYP/EPRIII level is reported (R2 ) 0.993 for over 100 nitrenes). Matrix photolysis of 3- phenyltetrazolo[1,5-a]quinazoline (25) affords the benzotriazacycloheptatetraene 29, which can be photochemically interconverted with the type I ring opening product 2-isocyano-Q- diazo-Q-phenyltoluene (33) as determined by IR and UV spectroscopy. The corresponding carbene 37, obtained by photolysis of 33, was detected by matrix ESR spectroscopy.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158359</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Holocene record of trans-Tasman dust transport: quantifying dust emissions from eastern Australia using geocheical proxies</field><field name="creator">Marx, Samuel Kenneth</field><field name="description">The transport of dust from the arid and semi-arid source regions of central and eastern Australia and its subsequent deposition in New Zealand is investigated using geochemical proxies of contemporary and geologic (Holocene) records of dust export. Australian dusts are characterized using a geochemical fingerprinting technique that allows their provenance to be established. Certain elements were found to be affected by pollution, mineral sorting, weathering/solubility, or method constraints and were not useful for provenancing dusts. The relative abundance of 20 other elements were found to reflect the chemistry of source area sediments and can be used to provenance long-range Australian dust deposited in New Zealand. This is achieved by matching the trace element chemistry of dusts believed to have undergone long-range trans-Tasman transport with those of potential Australian source areas, allowing the source area of the dust to be established at geologic-catchment scale - a spatial resolution not previously achieved. To account for dust from multiple source areas being transported during trans-Tasman dust transport events, and the contamination of long-range Australian dust deposited in New Zealand by local material, a mixing model was developed to determine the relative contribution of up to three source areas in contributing dust to the deposited sample. The application of this model allowed the first continuous records of dust emissions from eastern Australian to be constructed in New Zealand. In addition, this model also allowed Australian dust deposition rates in New Zealand to be linked directly to changes in source area conditions for the first time. The variability in, and controls on contemporary rates of Australian dust transport over New Zealand were established using an 11 year record of weekly atmospheric concentrations of the radio-nuclide 210Pb from New Zealand. Lead-210 is the daughter product of 222Rn, a gas which escapes into the atmosphere from continental crust. Consequently, concentrations of 222Rn (and by analogy 210Pb) are high over Australia, while they are very low in oceanic settings such as New Zealand. Lead-210 is extremely particle reactive, so once formed in the atmosphere, attaches immediately to aerosols implying it could be used as a dust tracer. Lead-210 activity was measured on dusts collected from New Zealand that had previously been determined to be at least partly of Australian origin using the trace element provenance model. In addition, 210Pb activity was also measured on the source sediments of these samples (from both New Zealand and Australia), also established using the trace element model. Results showed that 210Pb activity in the dust samples was orders of magnitude higher than in source sediments. This is because dust scavenges 210Pb from the atmosphere, thereby showing that 210Pb is a highly effective proxy measure of dust. Lead-210 activity in the long-range dusts collected from New Zealand was found to be related to the percentage of Australia material in a linear fashion. As a result, atmospheric 210Pb concentration data from New Zealand was converted into the first high resolution, decadal record of Australian dust flux. Clear seasonality was apparent, with dust flux highest in autumn-winter following summer river flows in dust source which results in sediment being unavailable for aeolian transport. Inter-annual variability in dust concentrations also occurred and this was postulated to be associated with the El Ni&#241;o &#150; Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon and its relationship to the hydro-meteorology of dust source areas in Australia. Consequently, it was concluded that the condition and availability of sediment within dust source areas is a major control on Australian dust emission rates. A Holocene record of Australian dust deposition in New Zealand was constructed from a peat core extracted from an alpine ombrotrophic rain-fed mire in Central Otago, New Zealand. The dust content of the core was determined by combusting the organic component, leaving the mineral dust. Dust samples through the core were analysed by ICP-MS and their provenance was established. This showed that dust in the core was primarily of Australian origin. Four phases of significant Australian dust deposition were identified in the ~8000 year old core; 1) a period of low dust deposition (0.142 g m-2 yr-1) from 7000 to 5000 B.P corresponding to a lacusterine phase in Lake Eyre, the most important Australian dust source; 2) a marked increase in dust deposition after 5000 B.P (0.577 g m-2 yr-1) coincident with Lake Eyre entering an ephemeral playa stage, and at the same time as global proxies suggest enhanced ENSO variability; 3) a peak in the deposition of Australian dust between 2500-1700 B.P (1.558 g m-2 yr-1) corresponding with a period of heightened ENSO variability; and 4) a return to lower dust deposition after 700 B.P (0.2984 g m-2 yr-1). The dust deposition record in the core is therefore an excellent proxy of climate variability and associated environmental change, with high dust deposition occurring during periods of marked climate instability. In particular, Australian dust was found to serve as an excellent proxy for ENSO intensity as it is a significant control on climate variability in the region. The dust transport and deposition rates measured by this study show that Australia has been a significnat source of dust in the Southern Hemisphere throughout the mid to late Holocene. Average contemporary Australian dust concentrations measured in New Zealand of 5.3 ?g m-3 are comparable to dust concentrations downwind of other major global dust sources such as the Sahara measured at Miami, Florida. In addition, Australian dust deposition rates in the peat core from New Zealand were also comparable to rates of long-range dust deposition in many other settings, such as the deposition of North African dust in the European Alps. As a result, Australian dust transport is likely to play a significant role in bio-geophysical systems in the region, such as soil formation, with Australian dust found to contribute between 50-100% of mineral content in some New Zealand settings.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158380</field></doc><doc><field name="title">LARGE-EDDY SIMULATION OF COMPRESSIBLE TURBULENT BOUNDARY LAYERS WITH HEAT ADDITION</field><field name="creator">Denman, Andrew Willem</field><field name="description">Turbulent wall shear stress has a significant impact on high speed vehicle performance. Its large magnitude, relative to the thrust that can be produced by propulsion systems such as Scramjets, means that it is worthwhile to attempt to control the wall shear stress levels. Experimental and numerical investigations have revealed that combustion of hydrogen in the boundary layer provides a means for such control. When combustion occurs, changes in mean flow property profiles across the boundary layer have already been identified. These changes in mean flow properties have been used to hypothesize about changes occurring to the turbulent mechanisms of momentum transfer. The purpose of this thesis is to examine the changes that occur to the turbulent momentum transfer mechanisms for boundary layers that experience a wall shear stress reduction through chemical heat evolution from hydrogen combustion. The comparisons are made using large eddy simulation (LES) to simulate the turbulent transport processes within a fully developed turbulent boundary layer. With the advent of dynamic subgrid scale LESmodels that require no a priori specification of model coefficients, LES presents itself as a high fidelity means of studying turbulent processes without the computational expense of direct numerical simulation (DNS). Comparisons were made between two types of subgrid scale models, the eddy-viscosity/eddy-diffusivity model and the approximate deconvolution model (ADM). While the differences were minimal in most instances, the dynamically adjusting ADM procedure yielded better agreement with DNS and experimental datasets. The ADM subgrid scale model was able to clearly demonstrate the presence of the turbulent coherent structures found within boundary layers. The evolution of heat from the combustion of hydrogen within the boundary layer is included through two methods. Firstly, finite rate chemical kinetics are used to model the combustion reactions of hydrogen pre-mixed with the boundary layer flow. Secondly, the finite rate chemical kinetics approach is used to develop an energy source term to represent the heat evolution without the additional computational overheads of advancing the chemical reactions through time. The results from the numerical simulations with and without heat addition to turbulent boundary layers are presented and both methods of heat addition indicated reductions in wall shear stress. The analysis of the mechanisms of wall shear stress reduction used mean flow profiles, velocity fluctuation statistics, two-point spatial correlations, energy spectra, Reynolds stress transport budgets and instantaneous flow field visualizations. Changes to the processes of turbulent momentum transport were observed. The contribution of the Reynolds shear stress (pu'w') to the transport of momentum across the boundary layer was computed to be reduced by 40% when compared to the levels computed with no heat addition. Investigation of the Reynolds shear stress without density scaling (u'w') revealed that not all of the reduction is tied up in the reduced mean density profile. The observation of changes to the turbulent velocity field was confirmed by lower levels of the RMS of wall normal velocity fluctuations. An explanation for the reduced wall normal velocity fluctuation levels was provided by the heat addition process reducing the pressure-strain velocity fluctuation redistribution from the streamwise to wall normal direction. This redistribution process is the dominant mechanism responsible for the supply of the wall normal velocity fluctuations and hence momentum transport to the wall. The turbulent structures were observed to be altered significantly with the near wall streaks increasing their coherence length in the streamwise and spanwise directions. The increasing streamwise coherence revealed a possible mechanism of wall shear stress reduction with the streak termination event, near wall ejections, demonstrating a significantly reduced contribution to the Reynolds shear stress which it normally dominates. This work has shown that the changes that occur within the turbulent boundary layer can be captured using the LES technique. Additionaly, these changes that occur during the combustion process can be represented efficiently using a heat source approach. The hypothesis that the addition of heat to the boundary layer would not only induce a reduction in wall shear stress through mean property changes but also alter the turbulent coherent structures has been demonstrated.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158448</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Longwall shearer cutting force estimation</field><field name="creator">Reid, Anthony Walton</field><field name="description">A methodology to monitor the real-time cutting forces generated by a longwall shearer is developed. Longwall shearers are the single productive element in an underground longwall coal mine, and are a major source of unscheduled system downtime. The cutting forces constitute the interaction between the longwall and the coal face. Knowledge of the forces can improve the reliability and productivity of longwall mines by providing a means of shearer condition monitoring. A Kalman filter based cutting force estimator is developed, and then tested using a comprehensive shearer simulation incorporating a dynamic representation of the cutterhead. Subsequently, prior work on autonomous shearer guidance with measured pick forces is extended by employing the estimated cutting forces to track changes to the shearer's horizon. This is validated by simulation. The force estimation methodology uses an extended Kalman filter to blend noisy measurement information with a nonlinear system model, the latter combining the dynamics of the shearer and its inputs. A detailed model is developed of the shearer rigid body dynamics, and of the measurements required for observability. The formulation avoids the use of sensors at the coal cutting interface. The methodology uses proven, practicable and reliable sensor technologies, making it suitable for longterm force monitoring. A comprehensive simulation of a longwall shearer is developed using the MATLAB(R) Simulink(R) and MSC.visualNastran 4DTM software environments. This incorporates dynamic representations of the major structures and inputs, including the interaction between the cutterhead and the coal face. The simulation is used to investigate the cutting forces in a number of different operational scenarios. This facilitates the construction of a basic dynamic model of the forces, and provides insight into the relationship between the cutting forces and the condition of the cutting interface. The cutting force estimator is tested using measurements from the shearer simulations. It is shown that the cutting force estimates track the fiducial forces well in each scenario. A number of modifications to the force models are also shown to improve the performance of the estimator. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to investigate the effect of tuned process noise covariance and model parameter errors on the estimates. The application to the problems of shearer condition monitoring and horizon tracking are considered. The first is demonstrated by detecting the effects of a worn pick and a seam hardness gradient on the force estimates, and the second by using the force estimates to track the motion of the cutterhead relative to an embedded stone band. The results show that it is possible, in principle, to estimate the cutting forces generated by a longwall shearer from indirect measurements using a Kalman filter methodology. Furthermore, the force estimates reveal changes to the cutting environment, and can track the vertical motion of the shearer as it operates. This thesis represents the first step in the development of a shearer cutting force estimator. The ultimate goal of the research is to improve the reliability and productivity of Australian longwall operations, using the estimated forces to monitor shearer condition. Autonomous horizon tracking with estimated forces can lead to further improvements to longwall productivity, and to the health and safety of mine personnel. A number of recommendations are made for future field validation, and development of an automated shearer condition monitoring system based on the cutting force estimates.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290502 Industrial Engineering</field><field name="subject">650202 Coal</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158453</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparison of the effects of a home-based and group-based resistance training program on the functional status and health of older Australians</field><field name="creator">Cyarto, Elizabeth Victoria</field><field name="description">Introduction: For older adults, physical activity (PA) is important in the prevention and management of chronic disease, and is able to reduce physical decline, maintain functional ability and prevent injuries. The benefits of progressive resistance training (PRT) for older adults have been well-documented. Although high-intensity training in controlled settings has been shown to significantly improve strength and functional performance, many barriers prevent older adults from attending formal 'gym'-based programs. Home and small group formats are potentially practical and feasible approaches for delivering community-based PRT programs. Previously, a home-based aerobic endurance program was found to be as effective as a group-based program in improving older adults' cardiovascular fitness (King, Haskell, Taylor, Kraemer, &amp; DeBusk, 1991). However, to date, no research study has directly compared homeand group-based PRT programs, in terms of assessing their relative effectiveness in improving older adults' functional ability, and physical and psychological well-being. The main aims of this study were to develop and evaluate a community-based PRT program for older adults and to compare the effectiveness of individual (home-based) and group (centre-based) program delivery. Methods: This group randomised trial involved 167 residents (mean age 79&#177;6 yrs, range 65 to 96 yrs, 79% women) from nine retirement villages. Villages were assigned to one of three program groups: 'Have A Try' (HAT) was a home-based program involving 11 exercises, supervised via home visits and telephone contacts; 'Come Have A Try' (CHAT) comprised the same exercises as 'Have A Try', delivered in a group format; the comparison program was a supervised walking group (CHATW). Participants completed/attended two 1-hour sessions twice a week for 20 weeks. Data were collected via self-complete survey and physical tests administered at baseline and 21 weeks. Outcome measures included objectively measured functional performance (Senior Fitness Test and static balance tests), self-reported balance confidence (Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale), health-related quality of life (Vitality Plus Scale and SF-12), psychological well-being (Goldberg Scale for Anxiety and Depression) and self-reported level of PA [assessed using the Community Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors survey, following examination of its measurement properties in a sample of 43 older adults]. For HAT and CHAT only, study retention, program adherence and compliance with the PRT prescription were assessed after the 20-week intervention phase (IP), and again after a 24-week Maintenance Phase (MP) and a further 20-week On-going Maintenance Phase (OMP). Results: Significant between-group differences were observed only for the lower body flexibility test (CHAT participants improved while HAT and CHAT-W participants did not, p&lt;0.05). However, strength, lower body flexibility and agility/dynamic balance improved in CHAT participants, and strength and upper body flexibility improved in HAT participants (all p&lt;0.05). Participants in the CHAT program improved their static balance scores more than those in the HAT program; however improvements in balance confidence were greater among participants in the HAT program (all p&lt;.05). Change in balance confidence was weakly correlated with change in dynamic balance/agility. There were no statistically significant changes over time or between groups in any indicators of physical and psychological wellbeing. The median amount of moderate-vigorous intensity PA (MVPA) was less than one hour per week in each intervention group at baseline. Participating in the HAT/CHAT/CHAT-W programs increased median MVPA frequency and volume, however the differences were not statistically significant over time or between groups. For activities not included in the intervention programs, there were no statistically significant differences in follow-up MVPA scores. Eighteen participants (11%) did not complete follow-up testing. There were no significant between-group differences in retention rates at the end of the IP. More HAT than CHAT participants withdrew from the study during the MP and the OMP (79% versus 49%, p&lt;0.01). More participants in CHAT than HAT achieved the target number of sets (2) and repetitions (15) for most exercises (p&lt;0.05) during the IP. More than half the HAT and CHAT participants completed &gt;=75% of the prescribed activity sessions during the IP, but adherence was significantly greater in CHAT than HAT during the MP (54% versus 36%, p&lt;0.01). Discussion: Both programs enhanced aspects of functional ability. However, the ability of the measures of well-being used in this study to detect changes associated with exercise interventions requires further evaluation. Instructor-led group classes were more effective than individual home-based programs in terms of retention and adherence, and encouraged better compliance with the training protocol. The findings of this study support the implementation of the PRT programs in retirement villages. In future, participants could benefit from support in adopting additional activities to accrue the health benefits of PA. This study highlights the potential for translation of this research into more widespread practice in aged care. Given current government interest and initiatives in Healthy Ageing, it would be timely to consider changes to policy and practice which encourage more widespread adoption of regular PRT programs in retirement villages and aged care facilities throughout Australia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158509</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PURINERGIC RECEPTOR-MEDIATED SIGNALLING IN NEURAL STEM CELLS AND PROGENITOR CELLS FROM THE ADULT MOUSE SUBVENTRICULAR ZONE</field><field name="creator">Stafford, Mark Richard</field><field name="description">Purinergic receptors mediate a wide variety of biological effects in response to extracellular nucleotides and nucleosides, such as ATP, ADP, UTP, UDP and adenosine. To date, nineteen purinergic receptor subtypes have been identified and classified based on their sequence identity, pharmacological properties and signal transduction mechanisms and include the ionotropic P2X receptors (P2X1 - 7) and the G-protein coupled P2Y (P2Y1, 2, 4, 6, 12 - 14) and adenosine receptors (A1, A2a, A2b and A3). Purinergic receptor activation leads to changes in cytoplasmic [Ca2+] and/or [cAMP] and the modulation of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) signalling cascades, which can result in mitogenic and/or inhibitory effects on cellular proliferation, migration and differentiation. In the central nervous system (CNS), extracellular ATP is released by neurons, astrocytes and vascular endothelial cells and plays a role in neurotransmission and neuromodulation. Furthermore, extracellular ATP acts as a critical signalling molecule for neuron-glial communication and is involved in the propagation of intercellular Ca2+ waves between astrocytes. The observation that purinergic signalling is an important factor in intercellular signalling, and has been shown to regulate proliferation, differentiation and survival in many cell types, has raised the possibility that purinergic receptors may also play a role in neurogenesis and development. Results presented in Chapter 3 demonstrate that undifferentiated neural progenitor cells isolated from the adult rat hippocampus express mRNA for all P2X receptor subtypes. The analysis of intracellular [Ca2+] transients in response to purinergic receptor agonists and other neurotransmitters show that hippocampal NPCs respond predominantly to ATP, ADP and glutamate via P2X7/P2X5 receptors, P2Y1 receptors and metabotropic glutamate receptors, respectively. Other neurotransmitters, such as GABA, glycine and acetylcholine were without effect. Electrophysiological measurements support these data and show that undifferentiated hippocampal NPCs share similar passive electrical properties to astrocytes, including electrical inexcitability and a high resting membrane potential (Q - 90 mV), providing a substantial electrochemical gradient for Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space via open P2X receptor ion channels. A more detailed analysis of purinergic receptor expression and function was conducted in primary neurosphere-derived NPCs generated in vitro from the subventricular zone (SVZ) of adult mice and in neural stem cells purified using flow cytometry (FACS) from acutely dissociated SVZ tissue. Results presented in Chapter 4 demonstrate that primary neurosphere-derived NPCs express similar purinergic receptors to FACS-purified neural stem cells. Both populations express mRNA for P2X4 and P2X7 receptors, all P2Y receptors, with the exception of the P2Y4 and the A1, A2a and A2b adenosine receptors. However, the neural stem cell population also expressed P2X1 and A3 receptor mRNA. ATP and the P2X7 receptor agonist, BzATP, evoked transient increases in cytoplasmic [Ca2+] in FACSpurified neural stem cells acutely dissociated from the SVZ, suggesting the functional expression of purinergic receptors. Furthermore, in similarity to NPCs isolated from the adult rat hippocampus, SVZ-derived NPCs exhibited transient increases in cytoplasmic [Ca2+] in response to purinergic and glutamatergic agonists but were insensitive to other neurotransmitters. Pharmacological profiling demonstrated that SVZ-derived NPCs express functional P2Y1 and P2Y2 receptors and a proportion of cells (Q 30%) showed transient increases in cytoplasmic [Ca2+] in response to the P2X7 receptor agonist BzATP, suggesting the functional expression of P2X7 and/or P2X4 receptors. Adenosine failed to elicit a Ca2+ response and did not significantly modulate basal levels of cAMP, however, A1 and A2a adenosine receptor protein was detected in primary neurospheres by western blot analysis. Having demonstrated that NPCs and neural stem cells derived from the SVZ of adult mice express functional purinergic receptors, we then investigated the effects of purinergic receptor activation on primary neurosphere frequency and proliferation in vitro. Experiments presented in Chapter 5 demonstrate that ATPyS, ADPbS and adenosine reduce the size and frequency of primary neurospheres in the presence of mitogens; epidermal growth factor (EGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), suggesting that crosstalk may occur between purinergic receptor and growth factor receptor signalling cascades associated with neural progenitor cell mitogenesis and survival. The inhibitory effect of ADPbS was antagonized by the P2Y1 receptor antagonist MRS 2179 and fully reversed by the P2Y12 receptor antagonist MRS 2395, which also antagonized adenosine receptors. The inhibitory effect of adenosine was attenuated by the A2a antagonist SCH 58261, and the A3 antagonist MRS 1523. Taken together, P2Y1, A2a and/or A3 receptors mediate inhibitory effects on growth factor-stimulated proliferation in primary neurospheres derived from the adult mouse SVZ. In passaged neurospheres, however, P2Y1 receptor activation potentiated NPC proliferation, whereas adenosine was inhibitory suggesting a change in ADP-sensitive P2Y receptor signalling occurs in NPCs selected for, and enriched over successive passages in the presence of mitogens EGF and bFGF. Neural progenitor cells have been reported to reside in a niche environment in close proximity to neurons astrocytes and the brain microvasculature. The functional expression of P2Y1, P2Y2 and P2X7 receptors in NPCs may enable these cells to participate in and/or respond to localized intercellular Ca2+ signalling within the neurogenic niche. Moreover, the modulation of neural stem cell and NPC proliferation by P2Y and adenosine receptor signalling pathways may represent a potential modulatory mechanism within the stem cell microenvironment (Stafford et al., in press).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158524</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MIX-SYN A Framework for Fast-tracking Analogue and Mixed-Signals Design</field><field name="creator">Liao, Eric</field><field name="description">Modern integrated circuits rely significantly on digital cores communicating with the real world using analogue and mixed-signals interfaces. High-speed serial communi- cations is a prime example where non-digital components play a crucial role in its predominantly digital functionality. Shortening time-to-market and shrinking process technologies have resulted in greater demand for fast design of mixed-signals systems. Digital components of these systems are easy to abstract and supported by established computer-aided-design (CAD) and electronic design automation (EDA) tools. This is in stark contrast to the analogue and mixed-signals components that are mostly designed using manual, time-consuming, and error-prone techniques. This thesis presents the MIX-SYN (MIXed-signals SYNthesis) Framework as a solution for improving analogue and mixed-signals design. Through examining current design processes and their fallacies, the top-down design methodology is reasoned as the path towards 'first pass success' for designers. The MIX-SYN Framework provides a unified system, behavioural, and transistor level simulation environment to bridge the existing discontinuity of design transfer between levels of abstractions. Designers can then fully realize the benefits of a proper top-down methodology with fast-tracking of design exploration and the facilitation design re-use.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158529</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of Robust Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: Electrode-Electrolyte Interfaces in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells at Ceramic Fuel Cells Limited</field><field name="creator">Knibbe, Ruth</field><field name="description">This study investigates the effect of 15 wt.% Al2O3 additions to the 10 mol.% Y2O3 stabilised ZrO2 (YSZ) electrolyte on the electrode-electrolyte interfaces in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) at Ceramic Fuel Cells Ltd. (CFCL). More specifically, what reactions occur with the Al2O3, and how do these affect the performance of the fuel cell. X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) were used to characterise the material properties of the interface structures. From this work it was found that at the anode-electrolyte interface NiAl2O4 forms in the Al2O3-YSZ electrolyte due to a reaction between NiO and Al2O3. The NiAl2O4 replaces the Al2O3 within the first 4 &#956;m of the electrolyte layer and grows out into the adjacent grain boundaries. From electrical characterisation, using Impedance Spectroscopy, it was concluded that although the formation of NiAl2O4 does not affect the oxide ion conductivity of the YSZ electrolyte grains the grain-boundary conductivity is severely impeded, at low temperatures (300 - 500 degrees C), by the NiAl2O4 growth. However, at the high operating temperatures of SOFCs at CFCL (~850 degrees C) the contribution of the grain-boundary conductivity to the total conductivity is diminished, and the NiAl2O4 is found to have no effect on the electrolyte conductivity. From XRD, SEM and TEM investigations of the cathode-electrolyte interface a tetragonal MnxAl3&#8722;xO4 phase is found to form in both the cathode and electrolyte during cathode sintering. During fuel cell operation the MnxAl3&#8722;xO4 experiences a destructive phase transformation to cubic MnxAl3&#8722;xO4. This transformation is associated with void formation and leads to a weakened mechanical integrity of the cathode-electrolyte interface, ultimately facilitating the delamination of the cathode layer from the electrolyte. It is concluded, at the current operating temperatures, the formation of the NiAl2O4 at the anode-electrolyte interface does not have an effect on the oxide ion conductivity of the YSZ electrolyte. However, as the trend is to reduce the operating temperature of the fuel cells, the formation of the NiAl2O4 would decrease the fuel cell efficiency at lower temperatures. In comparison, at the cathode-electrolyte interface, the detrimental phase transformation of MnxAl3&#8722;xO4 must to be avoided. A 10 &#956;m thick, dense YSZ layer deposited onto the YSZ-Al2O3 electrolyte stops MnxAl3&#8722;xO4 formation and creates a mechanically stronger cathode-electrolyte interface and ultimately leads to an increased SOFC lifetime.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158544</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Herpes Virus Evasion of the Interferon- Alpha-Stimulated Immune Response</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Daniel Thomas William</field><field name="description">Interferon (IFN) is a cytokine that acts rapidly via the Jak/Stat signalling pathway to induce an antiviral state in uninfected cells, and cell death in those already infected. Many viruses have evolved mechanisms to antagonize the IFN system, targeting all the major components involved in receptor binding and signalling. While a number of these viral inhibitors are homologous to cellular proteins involved in IFN down-regulation (e.g. vIRFs), many share little resemblance to known proteins. To determine the IFN-blocking properties of these proteins, functional protein-protein interaction studies are required. The first element of this study addressed the development of a new and rapid functional screening method. Based on inherent properties of the 2fTGH cell line, the system used selection upon a construct containing the guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase gene, tightly regulated by the 6-16 gene IFN-stimulated response element. By addition of 6- thioguanine in the presence of IFN, cells containing a functional pathway would die from toxic metabolites, however those with an inhibited pathway would survive. Expression cloning of viral IFN-blocking genes into 2fTGH and consequent selection with IFN@ and 6-thioguanine resulted in the outgrowth of cells that were no longer responsive to IFN@. It was also demonstrated that selection occurs if members of the Jak-STAT signalling pathway were lost. Furthermore, the screening system was validated using a known suppressor of IFN signalling, the human papillomavirus E7 gene. Expression of the E7 gene product resulted in loss of the ability of 2fTGH cells to respond to IFN@ treatment due to a functional disruption of the signalling pathway, and thus substantiated the suitability of the assay. Following development of the functional screen, the approach allowed investigation into the Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV1) for potential gene products involved in IFN@ signalling inhibition. This second part of the study involved the construction of a primary library from HSV1 genomic DNA and introducing it into the 2fTGH functional screen. Using a shotgun cloning approach, the library could be quickly prepared and still represent the greater majority of viral genes. Consequent selection with IFN@ and 6- thioguanine resulted in the outgrowth of cells, producing a number of clones that were no longer responsive to IFN@. Each clone was confirmed to have impairment in the IFN pathway by way of the integration of viral genes rather than some spurious mutation and maintained under selection to discourage reversion. Identification of the causative viral gene in each clone appeared to be more difficult than first expected. Following a number of different tactics, a PCR screen was established that allowed correlative detection of the viral genes present in each selected clone. This gave rise to a number of HSV1 genes potentially implicated in the inhibition of IFN@ signalling, namely the UL24, UL28, US6 and US9 genes. The third section of this study concentrated on the elucidation of the precise proteinprotein interplay of these implicated viral genes on the components of the Jak-STAT signalling pathway. Despite a variety of cloning approaches, only the US9 gene was successfully inserted into an expression vector and further examined. Re-selection of this positive clone in the 2fTGH system suggested a defined inhibitory role of the US9 gene product, as indicated by the disruption of signalling molecules. It appears that this function may be carried out indirectly or through some shuttling mechanism yet to be understood, as interactions of the US9 protein with Jak-STAT elements were suggested to be a possibility yet were inconclusive. This study has demonstrated that through the development of an IFN-responsive functional screen, entire viral genomes can be scanned for novel viral genes involved in IFN@ signalling. As certain difficulties affect viral gene identification, the current screening model may be more suitable for resolving the function of individual genes however a few adjustments to the preparation of genetic libraries could facilitate more efficient library screening. Consequently, the system could be extended to examine any virus, enabling IFN-resistance strategies to be consolidated, and development of a more complete regime of anti-viral compounds.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158547</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional characterisation of the multicopper oxidase from Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium</field><field name="creator">Tree, Jai Justin</field><field name="description">The multicopper oxidase (MCO) of Escherichia coli has been shown to confer copper tolerance under aerobic conditions by oxidation of cuprous copper to the less toxic cupric species. This MCO has also been shown to possess polyphenol oxidase activity and ferroxidase activity (Fe2+ --&gt; Fe3+). Multicopper oxidases with the later activity have been shown to play an important role in ferrous iron uptake in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Mco), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Fet3) and humans (hCp), where mutants exhibit diminished growth under iron limited conditions. Growth of an Escherichia coli cueO mutant was not diminished on metal depleted minimal medium supplemented with 2&#181;M ferrous iron as a sole iron source. However, copper sensitivity under these iron limited conditions was significantly increased in the cueO mutant. Copper sensitivity could be suppressed by the reactive oxygen species quencher Tiron, indicating that copper toxicity was due to oxidative stress. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy was used to assess transition metal accumulation in wild type and cueO cultures. The cueO mutant was found to accumulate almost 1000 fold more copper than wild type E. coli under iron limited conditions. Copper accumulation could be suppressed by the addition of Zn2+, Mn2+, or Fe suggesting accumulation of Cu in the cueO mutant may be through nonspecific divalent metal ion transporters such as ZupT or MntH. Transcriptional profiling of E. coli and an isogenic cueO mutant was undertaken on metal depleted minimal media. No changes in metal ion transporters were observed under these conditions indicating that changes in metal ion uptake do not occur at the transcriptional level in response to metal ion depletion. However, significant changes in expression of the outermembrane protein Ag43 and genes associated with motility were observed. Ag43 confers auotaggregation and clumping of cells in E. coli and resistance to hydrogen peroxide. Real time PCR measurement of sodC in E. coli delta cueO showed a 3.5 fold increase in transcription. Collectively, these results indicate that deletion of cueO leads to oxidative stress even in the absence of significant copper concentrations, plausibly by Fe2+ or Cu+ catalysed oxidative stress. Resistance to metal catalysed oxidative stress is essential for survival during infection. Deletion of cueO in the closely related enteric pathogen Salmonella typhimurium was found to significantly attenuate colonisation of Peyers patches, mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen and liver. Virulence could be partially restored by expressing cueO in trans. Recombinant CueO from S. typhimurium was expressed in E. coli as a fusion to StrepTagII and purified using streptavidin resin. Using an oxygen electrode cuprous oxidase and ferrooxidase activity was demonstrated for recombinant CueO. Km values for both Cu+ and Fe2+ oxidation were found to be significantly lower than those reported for CueO from E. coli. Measurements of kcat/Km indicated that CueO from S. typhimurium was a significantly better ferroxidase and cuprous oxidase than CueO from E. coli. Characteriation of an E. coli cueO mutant with regard to metal ion uptake, and transcriptional and phenotypic changes that occur in response to deletion of cueO are presented in this thesis. Further, characteristion of CueO as a novel virulence determinant in the closely related enteric pathogen S. typhimurium is presented.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158584</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expression and promoter analysis of Glycine max nodule autoregulation receptor kinase gene</field><field name="creator">Nontachaiyapoom, Sureeporn</field><field name="description">Legume-rhizobia symbioses contribute at least 20% of the biosphere's supply of reactive nitrogen. These unique associations rely on the exchange of specific molecular signals between nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria, collectively called rhizobia, and their host plants and, with few exceptions, result in the formation of root nodules, which provide an environment suitable for nitrogen fixation. However, nitrogen fixation is energetically expensive and nodule proliferation, in much the same manner as the proliferation of other meristems in plants, must be controlled in order to attain equilibrium between cell proliferation and differentiation. Nodule proliferation is controlled primarily and systemically by autoregulation of nodulation (AON). A gene central to this process was first isolated by map-based cloning from soybean (Glycine max) and was named G. max Nodule Autoregulation Receptor Kinase (GmNARK) in accordance with its biochemical and physiological functions. Expression patterns of GmNARK have been described by several investigators; however, these reports were based on either non-quantitative methods or a limited number of tissue types. More importantly, the expression domains of GmNARK were completely unknown. The study described in this thesis utilised techniques such as quantitative RT-PCR (QRTPCR), transcription start site mapping, promoter-reporter gene fusion, and promoter deletion, to analyse the expression levels and domains of GmNARK across a variety of tissues as well as identify the promoter elements that are responsible for the basal and tissue-specific expression of GmNARK. In addition, the promoter activity of GmNARK was also compared with that of Lotus japonicus HAR1, the GmNARK orthologue, in both homologous and heterologous transformation systems. Based on QRT-PCR, GmNARK was expressed to varying levels throughout the plant; the transcript was detected at high levels in mature leaves and roots but to a lesser extent in young leaves, shoot tips and nodules. The transcript level was not significantly affected by Bradyrhizobium japonicum during the first week following inoculation. Histochemical analysis of L. japonicus plants carrying either a 1.7 kb GmNARK promoter or 2.0 kb LjHAR1 promoter fused to a beta-glucuronidase reporter gene localised GUS activity to living cells within vascular bundles, especially phloem cells in leaves, stems, roots, and nodules. Phloem-specific expression was also detected in soybean hairy roots carrying these constructs. These results suggested that both cis- and trans-acting elements required for the transcriptional regulation of these orthologous genes are likely to be conserved. In contrast, 1.7 kb of the GmNARK promoter did not drive phloem-specific expression in Arabidopsis thaliana, indicating the absence of the trans-acting elements required for the tissue-specificity of GmNARK in this distantly related species. The comparison of 2.0 kb of promoter sequences of GmNARK, LjHAR1 and Medicago truncatula SUNN, another GmNARK orthologue, using bioinformatics and computational approaches indicated several highly conserved motifs including a putative negative regulatory region (NRR), which was previously reported to repress gene expression in non-phloem cell types. Deletion analysis of the GmNARK promoter, however, ruled out the possibility that this motif, found at -308 bp with respect to the translation start site, was truly functional and located the region controlling phloem-specific expression to DNA sequence between 908 bp and 1.7 kb upstream of the start codon. Two other candidate regions were identified by Multiple EM for Motif Elicitation (MEME). These regions, namely MEME3 and MEME4 showed strong sequence similarity to the corresponding regions of the LjHAR1 promoter. Interestingly, the MEME3 motif was also found in the MtSUNN promoter at a similar location to that of LjHAR1. Potential NRRs in the LjHAR1 and MtSUNN promoters were found in the MEME3 motifs, whereas only a variant form of a NRR in the GmNARK promoter was found in this region. Additionally, an identical semi-palindromic sequence was also observed in the MEME3 motifs of the three orthologous promoters. Based on these findings, the semi-palindromic sequence and the variant form of the NRR are proposed to be positive and negative regulatory elements for the phloem-specific expression of GmNARK, respectively. The computational approaches also identified two potential TATA elements in the GmNARK promoter. Rapid amplification of 5' cDNA ends and promoter deletion analysis have confirmed that they were functional. The two TATA elements in GmNARK promoter appeared to cooperatively direct transcription of GmNARK, but either was adequate for basal transcription. The finding that the expression of AON receptor-like kinase genes is phloem-specific has contributed to a better understanding of AON signalling pathways. The QRT-PCR study and the discovery of cis-acting regulatory regions have also provided crucial information on the transcriptional regulation of GmNARK as well as plant genes in general. Additionally, the promoters of GmNARK and LjHAR1 could potentially be used to drive phloem-specific expression in legume biotechnology research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300203 Plant Improvement (Selection, Breeding and Genetic Engineering)</field><field name="subject">legumes</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158587</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DYNAMIC ASSESSMENT OF ARTICULATORY FUNCTION IN ADULTS FOLLOWING TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY</field><field name="creator">Kuruvilla, Mili Suzan</field><field name="description">Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can have devastating effects on the speech system resulting in a neuromotor speech disorder known as dysarthria. Due to the often widespread nature of the damage subsequent to the trauma, varying severity levels and types of dysarthria have been reported. As a result of the articulatory subsystem being affected the individual could sustain mild consonant imprecision to totally unintelligible speech. The speech literature to date has largely focused on dysarthria subsequent to severe traumatic brain injury. With the growing incidence of traumatic brain injury the world over, it has become necessary to also explore the effects of mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) on the speech system. Conflicting evidence from neuropsychological investigations suggest that MTBI may or may not have persistent cognitive, linguistic effects up to one or two years post-injury. Speech and language disorders were considered as one of the prevalent symptoms reported amongst mildly injured TBI individuals. Previous investigations on dysarthric speech post-TBI have limited themselves largely to traditional subjective methods, invasive physiological instruments and/or restricted kinematic variables or speech tasks. Hence, the potential of the currently available dynamic physiological assessment methods, capable of tracking and recording once obscure lingual movements, has not been fully harnessed. With the use of convenient and sophisticated instrumentation like the Electromagnetic Articulograph (EMA) and Electropalatograph (EPG), alongside more traditional methods like perceptual speech sample analysis, a more complete and comprehensive investigation into the physiological basis of articulatory dynamics post-TBI can be undertaken. It is the view of the author that the articulatory kinematic spatial and temporal information provided by each of these instruments during dynamic speech tasks may supplement and/or complement the knowledge supplied by the other. Thus, a thorough understanding of the characteristics and underlying physiological bases of articulatory dysfunction post- TBI is possible. The primary aim of the thesis was to obtain comprehensive articulatory information regarding lingual movements towards, at and away from the palate during dynamic speech tasks of varying complexities by dysarthric speakers post-TBI using EMA and EPG. In Chapter 2, 10 individuals with severe TBI (mean age= 39.58 years, SD= 14.31) and six individuals with MTBI (mean age= 66.33 years, SD=6.61) were assessed using the AG 100 EMA system (Carstens Medizinelektronik, GmbH, Germany), and compared alongside 14 non-neurologically impaired control speakers. Articulatory kinematic profiles for the control, MTBI and severe TBI groups were obtained using the AG 100 system whilst repeating sentence and syllable embedded [t] and [k] productions at a habitual rate and loudness level. A comprehensive range of articulatory kinematic parameters were included in the study namely mean maximum velocity, mean maximum acceleration, mean maximum deceleration, distance and duration. The result of the comprehensive kinematic analysis revealed a significant difference between the control and severe TBI groups for the [t] and [k] sentence and [t] syllable productions. The severe TBI group demonstrated difficulties with the generation of speed (acceleration), control of speed (deceleration) and speed per se (velocity). The MTBI group, which comprised two mildly dysarthric speakers and four individuals with no discernible dysarthria, were comparable to the control group with respect to the measured kinematic parameters for both the sentence and syllable tasks. One of the widely acknowledged factors of any group investigation involving dysarthric speakers post-TBI is the heterogeneous nature of the deficit. Congruent with previous reports, the group results of the present study were considered to mitigate the articulatory characteristics of individual participants. Additionally, the perceptual ratings of individual participants belonging to the MTBI group revealed just noticeable alterations in consonant precision and phoneme length, requiring a case by case discussion of individual kinematic and perceptual profiles. Hence, the focus of Chapter 3 was to document the characteristics and specific nature of articulatory kinematics in each of the 16 individuals who had survived a traumatic brain injury. The study highlighted the advantages of an analysis of individual participant articulatory movement data. The results of the case by case physiological data analysis supported the existence of differential impairment in individuals with dysarthria following MTBI and severe TBI for the syllable repetition task where the MTBI group demonstrated minimal impairments in the control of speed and range of lingual movements and the severe TBI group exhibited widespread alterations in speed, generation and control of speed, range of movements and duration. For the sentence productions, both the mild and severe TBI groups demonstrated impairments in speed, generation of speed, range of movements and duration for tongue-tip and tongue-back productions. These results may be the outcome of differing severity levels of TBI on speech for a simple task versus a complex task where both the severe and MTBI groups appeared to be similarly affected. Chapter 4 presented the results of an electropalatographic (EPG) investigation of 11 individuals who had survived a severe TBI (mean age = 36.75 years, SD = 11.02) and who displayed a range of dysarthria severity levels from mild to moderate-severe. Each participant was fitted with a custom-made artificial acrylic palate that recorded lingual palatal contact during target consonant production. The target consonants [t, s, f, l, n] in a V CV phonetic environment were produced and analysed during sentence production and syllable repetition at a habitual rate and loudness level. Comparison of temporal parameters namely approach phase, closure/constriction phase, release phase and overall consonant durations for each consonant and task between the control and TBI groups were carried out. The results confirmed the presence of timing disturbances in the dysarthric speakers post-TBI. The TBI group was found to exhibit prolonged durations of the various phases of consonant production, which were attributed to articulatory slowness, impaired speech motor control, accuracy and coordination of articulatory movements. For the spatial measurements, the location, pattern and amount of tongue-topalate contacts were derived from the frame of maximum contact for each target consonant. Quantitative analysis, as well as visual inspection of the tongue-to-palate contact diagrams, indicated spatial aberrations in dysarthric speech post-TBI. Both the spatial and temporal aberrations may have at least partially caused the perceptual judgment of articulatory impairments in the dysarthric speakers. A secondary focus of the thesis was to investigate the effects of altered speech rate and loudness manipulations on articulatory kinematics since these suprasegmental modifications form an integral part of dysarthria therapy. Modifying speech rate and loudness may not only provide a scientific basis for compensatory strategies in dysarthria management but may also reflect the integrity of the neuromotor system and the nature of the speech production deficit in dysarthric speakers post-TBI. Chapters 5 and 6, which describe the investigation of augmented speech rate and loudness on articulatory kinematics, comprised six dysarthric individuals (mean age= 32.77 years, SD=10.80) post-severe TBI. These individuals were also selected on the basis that they had successfully completed both the EMA and EPG assessments. The participants were instructed to produce the target consonants [t] and [k] in the V CV phonetic environment during syllable and sentence repetitions as fast and as loud as possible for the rate and loudness investigations, respectively. Articulatory kinematic spatial and temporal comparisons were made across the habitual, fast and loud conditions within each participant group. Additionally, the fast and loud conditions were compared across the control and TBI groups in order to establish articulatory kinematic spatial and temporal differences between the two groups during speech tasks that are more effortful and are intended to tax the speech mechanism. In Chapter 5 the investigation into articulatory dynamics during speech rate manipulations revealed that the control group and TBI group selected different strategies for increasing rate. The control group demonstrated no effects of rapid rate on articulatory kinematics for sentence productions. However, for the syllable repetitions, reductions in movement displacement were observed for the control group. Based on previous literature, it appears that the control group were driven by the need to maintain articulatory precision for the sentence productions whereas the syllable repetitions were susceptible to articulatory undershoot. From the results of the TBI group it appears that they conformed to increasing articulatory effort and force for the [t] and [k] sentence and [t] syllable repetitions. The TBI group may have chosen to increase articulatory effort to preserve distinctiveness of phonetic segments in order to avoid articulatory undershoot. The fast rate comparisons across the control and TBI groups revealed that the TBI group had reduced overall rates of sentence and syllable production compared to the control group possibly reflecting a uniform slowness of articulatory movements. The investigation into the effects of altered loudness on EMA and EPG-derived articulatory kinematic spatial and temporal parameters (Chapter 6) revealed that the loudness effects on the sentence and syllable tasks for each group were varied. Loudness related scaling of articulatory movements was observed in both the control and TBI group for tasks that demonstrated a significant magnitude of loudness change in the absence of any reduction in rate. The TBI group who were consistently louder than the control group for all tasks demonstrated these effects for [t] and [k] sentence and [t] syllable repetitions. The [k] syllable repetitions displayed an interaction between reduced speech rate and increased speech loudness and hence retained articulatory kinematic profiles similar to the habitual condition. For the control group, only the [t] syllable repetitions, which presented as the loudest task amongst all other tasks, exhibited an upscaling of articulatory movements. A difference in the magnitude of loudness change may be partly responsible for these task related differences in articulatory kinematics for the control group. Across the two groups, a task based difference was observed such that only the syllable repetitions between the groups were significantly different. These task based differences were attributed to varying speech motor, phonetic and/or cognitive requirements across the two tasks. The experiments presented in this thesis served to provide valuable insights into the overall, as well as specific characteristics, of the underlying physiological bases of articulatory dysfunction in dysarthria following TBI.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158599</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards successful aquaculture of the Tropical Rock Lobster, Panulirus ornatus: The microbiology of larval rearing.</field><field name="creator">Payne, Matthew</field><field name="description">The Australian ornate rock lobster, Panulirus ornatus has been identified as a good candidate for commercialisation as an aquaculture species due to the high demand for the animal on overseas markets and a short larval lifecycle compared to other Palinurid lobsters. However like most cultured crustaceans, disease, in particular bacterial diseases, are currently major constraints on the successful larval culture of the animal. This study represents the first detailed investigation of the microbial diversity within a larval rearing system of the ornate rock lobster P. ornatus. The study has particularly concentrated on the microbial communities within the water column in addition to bacteria associated with cultured and wild P. ornatus larvae (phyllosoma) using both culture-based and molecular microbiological techniques. An insight into the microbial dynamics of the larval rearing system is provided, which combined with the microbial community overview, has allowed more effective microbial management regimes to be implemented, subsequently improving larval survival. The microbial population of the water column was dynamic and highly diverse, consisting largely of marine microorganisms affiliated with the classes a and y-Proteobacteria and the Division Bacteroidetes. A small number of opportunistic pathogens were also retrieved, consisting mainly of Vibrio species, however it is unclear whether these organisms within the water column are involved in the larval mortalities observed. Several Bacillus sp. strains were isolated from the water column and there is potential to use these as probiotics to benefit phyllosoma survival. Extensive colonisation of PIII phyllosoma by filamentous bacteria was observed following scanning electron microscopy analysis of phyllosoma and the majority of these bacteria were later confirmed as Thiothrix sp. following fluorescent in-situ hybridisation analysis. This colonisation is predicted to have negative effects on the health of early stage phyllosoma by hindering their ability to moult and feed. As a result, the animals are likely to be susceptible to infection by pathogenic bacteria such as Vibrio spp. A diverse collection of Vibrio species featured prominently in culture-based and molecular analyses of cultured phyllosoma including potential pathogenic strains, such as Vibrio harveyi and Vibrio campbellii. As Thiothrix sp. is a sulphide-oxidising bacteria, the lowering or removal of sulphide compounds within the larval rearing system is a potential means of control. At present, ozonation of all incoming larval rearing water is serving as an effective Thiothrix sp. control mechanism. The microbial diversity associated with cultured and wild phyllosoma differed markedly when compared using molecular based clone library analysis. The cultured phyllosoma microbial community was dominated by -Proteobacteria, principally comprising a large proportion of Vibrio and Pseudoalteromonas species, with many likely candidates responsible for compromising phyllosoma health and causing larval mortalities. In contrast, wild phyllosoma were largely dominated by y-Protebacterial organisms, such as Sulfitobacter sp. The wild environment potentially promotes phyllosoma health through the presence of bacteria, such as Roseobacter sp. that possess favourable attributes for phyllosoma survival. By incorporating such potentially probiotic bacteria into the larval rearing of phyllosoma it may be possible to enhance phyllosoma health and subsequently improve larval survival. Whole phyllosoma survival assays were undertaken to identify both potential pathogenic and probiotic strains isolated during the course of this study. Bacteria were inoculated either directly to the water column or through an Artemia sp. feed vector and phyllosoma survival monitored to measure improved or reduced larval survival. No statistically significantly increased mortality (pathogenic strains) or improved survival (probiotic strains) were identified in these animal assays. An absence of water exchanges, with progressively increasing organic load comprising phyllosoma health within all treatments was identified as one flaw that may have caused the negative results. However candidate bacterial strains were identified for further study including a potentially probiotic Vibrio alginolyticus strain. It is also possible that the Vibrio sp. strains tested during our experiments were not pathogenic, an argument supported by the absence of haemolysin production in all isolates tested. The use of probiotic bacterial strains to improve survival in cultured P. ornatus phyllosoma has potential and is an area that currently requires further research. It is envisaged that an Australian aquaculture industry for P. ornatus will be viable in due time, however at present further research is required into the monitoring and removal of pathogenic Vibrio spp., through the use of such techniques as real time PCR, bacteriophage therapy, quorum sensing inhibition and probiotics. In addition, the development of improved nutritional sources to aid phyllosoma health and promote a robust immune defence for the animal are required if a successful commercial aquaculture industry for the species is to be established.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158606</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Density dependent Markov population processes: models and methodology</field><field name="creator">Ross, Joshua Vincent</field><field name="description">A feature exhibited by all populations is demographic stochasticity. This is randomness that arises from chance events inherent in birth and death; finding a partner, successfully reproducing, the number of offspring produced and age at death are just some examples of events governed by chance in population dynamics. Additionally, the study of the probability of extinction and expected time to extinction can only be undertaken in a stochastic framework. I provide models and accompanying methodology for enabling the use of stochastic models for real biological modelling. In particular, we will consider a class of continuous-time Markov chains with a particular form of rates, known as (asymptotically) density-dependent Markov pop- ulation processes. These are continuous-time Markov chains that satisfy the properties that the changes in state (in each dimension) are of magnitude unity, and the transition rates take the form (at least asymptotically in N) qN(i, i + l) = Nf ( i N , l), l 6= 0, for a suitable scaling parameter N and function f. These processes have been widely studied in the applied probability literature, and have appeared extensively in the theoretical literature in a variety of contexts. Results of Kurtz and Barbour have played a major part in establishing this ubiquity. Kurtz established a functional law of large numbers, and a functional central limit law, for such processes, consequently establishing unique deterministic and Gaussian diffusion approximations, respectively. I utilise these results to firstly establish deterministic and diffusion approximations for models of metapopulations in a dynamic landscape, before establishing a method for incorporating initial state uncertainty, and a method of parameter estimation, for general (asymptotically) density-dependent Markov population processes. As habitat loss and fragmentation continues around us, populations are being forced to occupy patches of subdivided habitat. With the addition of the numerous species that naturally occupy landscapes of this type, such as wood roaches in fallen logs, fish on coral reefs and parasites on hosts, metapopulations are rapidly becoming the pre-eminent paradigm for ecological modelling. A key component affecting metapopulation fluctuations is often the dynamics of the landscape itself. We look at models for metapopulations that account for dynamic landscape. I show, for each model, that a suitably scaled version converges, uniformly in probability over finite time intervals, to a deterministic model. Additionally, I establish bivariate normal approximations to their (quasi-)stationary distributions. This allows us to consider the effects of habitat dynamics on metapopulation dynamics and provides an effective means for modelling metapopulations inhabiting dynamic landscapes. I find that habitat dynamics can have a significant impact upon metapopulation dynamics, reducing the expected number of occupied patches and increasing the variability in patch occupancy. Additionally, I find that mainland-type patches help alleviate these affects, and thus argue for the introduction of mainland-type patches as a conservation management action. Ecologists and conservation biologists have become interested in the optimal way to manage and conserve such metapopulations. I investigate an extension of the previous models, that allows a number of the patches to be protected from disturbance, and we use this model to answer the question - how can we optimally trade-off returns from protection versus creation? I find that when habitat dynamics are slow in comparison to patch occupancy dynamics it is optimal to create new patches, while under the reverse conditions it is optimal to protect existing patches before creating new patches. When the time scales are similar it is difficult to establish a robust rule of thumb. However, a deterministic approximate solution is presented, which provides a reasonable rule of thumb, in particular when the number of patches is large. Next we will consider initial state uncertainty in population modelling. Most modelling in ecology assumes that the initial state of the system being studied is known. In reality, this initial state is rarely known to such a high degree of precision. I investigate under what conditions ignoring uncertainty in the initial state matters, and additionally provide an extension to the technique of Kurtz, allowing us to establish explicit expressions for the mean and variance of the process, incorporating an initial distribution, at any point in time. Whilst continuous-time Markov chains are ubiquitous in the theoretical literature, their application has been limited, partly due to a lack of clear statistical procedures for fitting the models to data. I address these statistical limitations by providing straightforward methods for parameter estimation, so enabling this rich family of models to be used in real biological modelling. A general approach, applicable to any finite-state continuous-time Markovian model, is presented, and this is specialised to a computationally more efficient method applicable to (asymptotically) density-dependent Markov population processes. This method is found to be consistently highly accurate under certain (weak) conditions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158615</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations into Adaptive MIMO Systems for Indoor Wireless Communications</field><field name="creator">Uthansakul, Peerapong</field><field name="description">Over the last few years, wireless communications has experienced the rapid growth in the demand for provision of high data rate wireless multimedia services. This rapid growth has triggered the search for new ways to improve the spectrum efficiency of wireless communication systems, as the available radio spectrum becomes nearly congested. Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems have emerged as a promising technology to enhance the spectrum efficiency of present and future wireless communications systems by exploiting the spatial domain at both transmitter and receiver sites. The move to exploit the spatial or angular domain to the purpose of enhancing the operation of wireless communication systems has already been made by adaptive or smart antennas. They use multiple-element antennas with suitable signal processing only at transmitter or receiver. MIMO systems make a further step and employ multiple-element antennas accompanied by suitable signal processing algorithms both at transmitter and receiver. While smart antennas can operate well in environments characterized by approximate Line Of Sight (LOS) conditions, MIMO systems exhibit the largest advantages over the traditional Single Input Single Output (SISO) systems in pure Non Line Of Sight (NLOS) environments. Although MIMO systems have been successfully demonstrated in both theoretical and practical works, but those results are based on the assumption of independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) channels or pure NLOS conditions. Real signal propagation environments are characterized by both LOS and NLOS conditions. This is typical for indoor environments. The MIMO system has to adapt to this varying signal propagation situation. This thesis aims at investigating adaptive MIMO systems whose operation can be adapted to the varying indoor environments. The thesis commences with investigations into MIMO channel models which can be suitable for indoor environments. Both physical and non physical MIMO channels models are considered. The investigated channel models are verified by using measured data, available from various sources. The next task launched in this thesis is evaluating of the MIMO channel capacity under the mixed LOS and NLOS conditions. In this regard, a new transmission scheme is proposed to achieve the highest information transfer rate compared with the other schemes proposed in literatures. This is achieved at the expense that transmitter requires the information knowledge of Rice K factor and Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), as measured at the receiver site. While assessing the MIMO channel capacity, of importance is the issue of signal normalizations. Because the different normalizations provide different results with respect to the assumed transmitted or received power. This thesis proposes to clearly include one of the two assumptions while observing capacity of fixed transmitted power or fixed received power. It is pointed out that this approach enables better understating of benefits of MIMO systems from the practical perspective. The MIMO capacity is a figure of merit of high importance from the viewpoint of information theory. The thesis points out that in order to assess MIMO performance from the practical point of view other measures such as Bit Error Rate (BER), computational complexity, processing delay have to be also investigated. The remaining parts of the thesis focus on adaptive MIMO OFDM system whose operation is assessing those other perform measures. A mathematical formulation of signal model is presented followed by the own-proposed adaptive algorithm implemented in MATLAB. The proposed algorithm is based on Lagrange multiplier method which offers an optimal solution without using an iterative procedure. It is shown that the new algorithm is advantageous over the most commonly used greedy algorithm. Through the manifest examples it is shown that the proposed algorithm can be of significant value to adaptive MIMO OFDM systems. The work undertaken as part of this thesis has been published in several journals and refereed conference papers, which underline the originality and significance of the thesis contributions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158631</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of PPAR Activity by Novel Modulators</field><field name="creator">Allen, Tamara</field><field name="description">Recent decades have seen a worldwide explosion of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 85-90% of all diabetes cases with an estimated 940,000 Australians aged 25 years and over afflicted. This number has trebled since 1981. Globally, type 2 diabetes afflicts approximately 150-200 million people, with this number expected to increase to 300 million by 2010. A major contributor to this massive increase in type 2 diabetes is obesity. World wide, more than 1 billion adults are overweight with at least 300 million of these clinically obese. This rapid rise in lifestyle related diseases reflects changes in behavioural patterns including diets consisting of high proportions of saturated fats and sugar and a tendency toward less physical activity. This trend is proving to socially and economically burden communities worldwide. Current therapies for the treatment of type 2 diabetes include a class of glucose lowering, insulin sensitising drugs, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which were developed before the molecular target had been identified. Research has since identified the nuclear receptor Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor y (PPARy) as the molecular target of these drugs. Activation of this receptor by TZDs has been found to ameliorate the metabolic disturbances associated with type 2 diabetes ie hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance and some aspects of dyslipidemia. Unfortunately, the current therapies that target PPARy produce adverse side effects, particularly in those patients co-treated with insulin, including edema and weight gain, which are counterproductive in the context of the metabolic syndrome. As a result, there is a requirement for the identification of novel compounds that can elicit the positive antidiabetic effects while avoiding negative side effects. Such compounds include SPPARyMs (Selective PPARy Modulators). These compounds are partial agonists/antagonists of PPARy, capable of differentially modulating cofactor interaction and resultant gene expression relative to full agonists. In addition, they are capable of antagonising the PPARy mediated effects elicited by full agonists in a cell specific manner. We demonstrate that halofenate, a phenoxy acetic acid derivative, initially described and utilised in the 1970s to lower triglycerides and glucose in type 2 diabetic patients, is a SPPARyM. Halofenic acid, the circulating form of halofenate, binds to and modulates PPARy. It is a partial agonist that is capable of antagonising the activity of the full agonist, rosiglitazone. It displays weak adipogenic potential and antagonises rosiglitazone-mediated adipogenic differentiation in human preadipocytes. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, halofenic acid differentially modulates the expression of PPARy target genes. This partial agonism/antagonism may be explained in part by the attenuated displacement of corepressors (N-CoR and SMRT) coupled with the defective recruitment of coactivators (p300, CBP and TRAP220). In vivo studies in ob/ob and fa/fa rodents demonstrate that halofenate is equally as efficacious as rosiglitazone at ameliorating insulin resistance, but without eliciting weight gain. Second generation halofenate derivatives were also found to differentially activate PPARy and PPARa. These compounds are partial PPARy agonists, capable of dose dependently activating PPARy with reduced efficacy and/or potency compared to rosiglitazone. Each compound also displays a unique efficiency and potency at displacing corepressors and recruiting coactivators. On the basis of these findings the halofenate derivatives were similarly classified as SPPARyMs. The modulation of PPARy activity and interactions with cofactors by SPPARyMs ultimately leads to a distinct gene expression profile. Analysis of target genes in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells reveal these compounds have differential effects on the expression of genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism, in comparison to rosiglitazone. It is these discrete changes in the down stream effects of PPARy signalling that may lead to a more beneficial metabolic outcome than that observed for full PPARy agonists. Despite the differences in the modulation of PPARy activities, halofenate and its derivatives have been found to retain the insulin sensitising effects of full agonists while avoiding the side effects associated with them. These compounds may provide not only a novel approach to treating type 2 diabetes, but also offer a unique tool in further understanding PPARy signalling and its role in ameliorating symptoms associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158681</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geochronology of weathering and landscape evolution, Hamersley Iron Province, Australia</field><field name="creator">Heim, Jonathan Andrew</field><field name="description">Weathering geochronology permits delimiting the ages of weathering profiles, determining rates of weathering and landscape evolution and inferring palaeoclimatic and environmental conditions that control the surficial evolution of continents. It also provides insights into the timing and rates of supergene enrichment of metal and precious mineral deposits. Until recently, weathering geochronology was primarily based on K-Ar and 40Ar/39Ar dating of supergene minerals. Recent advances by U-Th series dating of pedogenic carbonate (Sharp et aI., 2003), in situ U-Th series dating of iron hydroxides (Bernal et aI., 2006), U-Pb SHRIMP dating of opals (Nemchin et aI., 2006), and (U-Th)/He and 4HePHe analysis of supergene goethite (Shuster et aI., 2005) expand the number of minerals and the time range where weathering geochronology can be applied. Weathering profiles blanket more than one third of the Australian continent and are purportedly among the oldest weathering profiles on earth. Unravelling the history of weathering and landscape evolution in these areas requires techniques capable of dating supergene minerals at all time scales, but particularly at the &gt; I Ma scale. Currently, the K-Ar, U-Pb, and U-Th/He methods are the only techniques suitable to directly date supergene minerals on such time-scales. In this study, I show how the combination of 4&#176;ArP9Ar and (U-Th)/He geochronology can be used to unravel the weathering and landscape evolution history of continents. The application of radiogenic isotope-dating techniques and the proper interpretation of geochronological results require understanding of the dated mineralogy and the presence of potentially contaminating phases. The successful application of 40ArP9Ar weathering geochronology was made possible through detailed understanding of the hollandite-group Mn oxide and alunite-group sulfate crystal chemistry and mineral physics. Similarly, in this study, I have refined the application of (U-Th)/He dating of goethite. The successful application of this technique relies on the identification and selection of suitable goethitebearing samples in the field; the characterization of mineral paragenesis by optical microscopy; the determination of fine-scale mineral chemistry and paragenesis through electron microscopy and microprobe analysis; the determination of physico-chemical properties (mineral structure, crystallinity) of the various types of supergene goethite through x-ray (bench-top and synchrotron) diffraction techniques; and application to noble gas diffusion experiments in ultra-high vacuum techniques to quantify the crystallochemical controls on the helium (natural radiogenic 4He and artificial spallogenic 3He) diffusion properties and retentivity of goethite. Finally, to test the reliability of the (U-Th)/He dating method, I apply the methodology to weathering profiles in a range of geological environments where stratigraphic and paragenetic relationships provide tight constraints on the possible history of mineral precipitation. For the applied component of this study, I (with a group of collaborators) chose the Hamersley Province as the key study site for the application of combined 40ArP9Ar and (UTh)/ He geochronology, for several reasons: the Hamersley Province is one of the longest lived landscapes on Earth and is extensively blanketed by thick weathering profiles that contain a plethora of crystalline goethite suitable for (U-Th)/He dating; the goethite in these weathering profiles coexists with K-bearing Mn oxides suitable for 4&#176;Ar/39Ar dating; and mining operations provide exposure and access to near complete weathering profiles, enabling the sampling of goethite and Mn oxides for geochronology. Deep (50 to 100 metres on average and up to 400 metres) lateritic weathering profiles in the Hamersley Province outcrop over 80, 000 km2 on ridges and plateaus, ranging in height from II 00 m to 400 m. These lateritic weathering profiles are developed on Archaean banded-iron formation and host some of the world's largest iron ore deposits. Some authors have proposed that the lateritic weathering profiles represent the remnants of a continuous Mesozoic land surface now partially eroded. Surrounding the plateaus and ridges, ferruginized detrital sediments on valley slopes and floors and ferruginized detritus in paleochannel deposits (channel iron deposits or CID), also hosting high-grade iron ore, reveal evidence of widespread erosion and re-deposition of former weathering profiles. They also display evidence of post-depositional weathering and ferruginization, suggesting a complex interplay between weathering and erosion during landscape evolution in the region. 4&#176;ArP9Ar dating of 204 grains of supergene Mn oxides (mostly cryptomelane and hollandite) extracted from 70 samples from seven distinct weathering profiles at 7 field sites, up to 300 kilometres apart, yield precipitation ages ranging from 63.4 &#177; 0.9 to 1.5 &#177; 0.2 Ma. When combined with previous unpublished 40ArP9Ar results, ranging from 81.1 &#177; 0.4 to 11.6 &#177; 0.3 Ma, the geochronology indicates a prolonged (Late Cretaceous to Recent) and episodic weathering record for the Hamersley Province, where periods of intense dissolution-reprecipitation of Mn oxides (51-41, 24-16 Ma) alternate with periods of relatively subdued mineral precipitation. The intense periods of mineral dissolution-precipitation correlate with maj or global climatic events. The goethite precipitation record confirms the longevity of weathering processes identified in the Mn oxide record. (U-Th)/He dating of 85 grains of goethite from 39 samples (20 hand specimens) from six sampling sites (5 sites sampled for 4&#176;Ar/39Ar geochronology) yield reliable precipitation ages, ranging from 84.3 &#177; 12.2 to 3.0 &#177; 0.2 Ma. The deep (~100 m) lateritic weathering profile overlying banded iron-formation in the Hamersley Province record weathering process already ongoing in Late Cretaceous and spanning the Paleogene and Neogene. The geochronological results also reveal that the lateritic profiles in the Metawandy Valley (50-2 Ma), Mt Wall (60-30 Ma), Mt Tom Price (81-12 Ma) and Marandoo (52-12 Ma) regions had already reached great depths (70-100 m on average and up to 220 m below present land surfaces) by at least the Late Cretaceous or Early Paleogene. The results also show that weathering has been less effective at promoting the advancement of the weathering front during the Late Paleogene and Neogene. The geochronological results for authigenic supergene Mn-oxides and goethite III ferruginized detrital deposits (canga) in the Rhodes Ridge (41 to 7 Ma) area indicate that former land surfaces blanketing the Hamersley Province plateaus and ridges had been partially or nearly completely eroded by at least the Eocene. Geochronological results for the channel iron deposits reveal a similar scenario. 40ArP9Ar dating of Mn oxides (ranging from 32 to 17 Ma at the Lynn Peak Cm) and (U-Th)/He dating of goethite (ranging from 18 to 5 Ma at the Yandicoogina cm, and from 43 to 28 Ma at the Lynn Peak Cm) in late-stage authigenic cements indicate that the channel iron deposits had completely aggraded with ironrich sediments and were undergoing goethite cementation (ferruginization) by, at least, the Late Middle Eocene. Age versus depth distributions in channel iron deposits indicate that ferruginization of the channel sediments becomes progressively younger with depth in the profile, strongly suggesting that ferruginization occurred at the groundwater-atmosphere interface and the process moved downwards through progressive deepening of the water table. I interpret that this process was driven by the overall transition towards aridity of northwestern Australia in the Neogene. Excursion towards more humid climates in the Early-Middle Miocene has promoted the partial dissolution and secondary precipitation of channel cements in the upper parts of the profiles or near surface environments. Correlation between the weathering record and independent climatic and environmental indicators suggests that the formation of lateritic weathering profiles on banded iron-formation can be linked to warm and humid climatic conditions in the Late Cretaceous and Early Paleogene, when Australia lay with Gondwana at low latitudes. Climate change at the end of Paleogene, a consequence of the break-up of Gondwana and Australia's accelerated drift away from Antarctica, is identified at this stage as the causal event that promoted the erosion and deposition of former weathering profiles and the formation of extensive detrital and paleochannel deposits. Amid the Neogene aridification of northwestern Australia, a brief excursion towards more humid climatic conditions at the Early Miocene has promoted extensive re-crystallization of supergene minerals in weathering profiles throughout the region. The Neogene aridification of northwestern Australia may also explain the decelerating rates of weathering and weathering front propagation in lateritic profiles of this regIOn. A comparison of the weathering record obtained for the Hamersley Province with the results of similar studies from the Carajas and Quadrilatero Ferrifero Regions, Brazil, and Burkina Faso and Gabon, West Africa, reveals that intense weathering and enrichment ofMn oxides within the weathering profiles occurred at the 50-40 Ma interval, but particularly at 47-45 Ma. The remarkably similar weathering history obtained for the three southern Hemisphere continents suggests that weathering in these ancient landscapes may be controlled by global (greenhouse) climatic conditions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Landscape evolution</field><field name="subject">Geophysical weathering</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158744</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptive Phase Measurements</field><field name="creator">Berry, Dominic William</field><field name="description">In this thesis I consider the general problem of how to make the best possible phase measurements using feedback. Both the optimum input state and optimum feedback are considered for both single-mode dyne measurements and two-mode interferometric measurements. I derive the optimum input states under general dyne measurements when the mean photon number is fixed, both for general states and squeezed states. I propose a new feedback scheme that introduces far less phase uncertainty than mark II feedback, and is very close to the theoretical limit. I also derive results for the phase variance when there is a time delay in the feedback loop, showing that there is a lower limit to the introduced phase variance, and this is approached quite accurately under some conditions. I derive the optimum input states for interferometry, showing that the phase uncertainty scales as 1/N for all the common measures of uncertainty.

There is considerable pressure on small industries such as ginger in search of ways in which they can be made to operate efficiently and sustain the economy. Expansion of commercial agriculture into marginal land which is unsustainable adds enormous pressure on land causing soil erosion. Coupled with this is the quality issue which is a serious problem of ginger production and has reduced its competitiveness over the years. This study focuses on two types of losses in ginger production to provide an integrated approach to policy making and computing production losses. One is the observable output loss at the farm site that is not sold due to sub-standard quality related to disease and the other is the unobserved output loss due to inefficient production. The research attempts to answer the question of whether the Fiji ginger farmers are producing efficiently, and at what levels. The relative importance of each input in ginger production is examined. The study undertakes to determine the effects of key variables on farm efficiency. Also examined is the overall farm profiles based on the efficiency rankings of the ginger producers. Furthermore, this research attempts to determine factors that influence soil erosion, and those that influence the observed ginger loss. Using cross-sectional data from a ginger farm survey conducted in June 2007, this research estimates a stochastic production frontier which incorporates soil erosion as an input in the framework. Very few studies have looked at the impact of soil erosion in this context; hence, this study fills the gap by incorporating land quality in the analysis. Farms were found to produce at 69% of their maximum potential output and soil erosion resulted in 6.8% loss in ginger output. This also implies that using the same resources, technology and farming techniques efficiently can lead to a 31% increase in output. While unobserved loss to farm income is a 27% (F$4.6m) increase over the observable loss at farm site, the revenue loss to the whole industry is at least 30% (F$5.07m). Profit was a key determinant of both losses, but staying on farm, slope of land, manure use and hot water treatment affected the observed but not unobserved loss. Although farmer education had no effect on both losses, it was important for undertaking soil conservation. Fiji is in a good position to increase production as education, age and experience of farmers were not significant determinants of efficiency. Thus, displaced farmers from sugar cane farming (given serious concerns of the viability of that industry) can be encouraged to move with ease into ginger as an alternative livelihood. Lastly, the study highlights some practical implication which calls for an integrated package of policies related to use of best farming techniques, land tenure and, agricultural extension and support services for sustainable agricultural growth.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Technical efficiency, soil erosion, stochastic frontier model, multinomial logit model</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159424</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gympie, "The Town That Saved Queensland": Popular Culture and the Construction of Identity in a Rural Queensland Town</field><field name="creator">Mr Robert Edwards</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430000 History and Archaeology</field><field name="subject">Festivals, Cultural History, Rural Studies, Rural Culture, Australian Studies, Queensland History, Tourism Geography</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159426</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic parameter estimates for plasma IGF-1 and production and reproductive traits in Large White, Landrace and Duroc pigs</field><field name="creator">Ms Maria Da Gloria Taela</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159437</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of Acquired Neurogenic Communication Disorders in Adults using a Telerehabilitation Application</field><field name="creator">Anne Hill</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">telerehabilitation, speech-language pathology, communication, assessment, aphasia, dysarthria, apraxia of speech.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159440</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inhibition of viral infection in Penaeus monodon prawns by using RNA interference</field><field name="creator">Ms Thi Hoang Oanh Dang</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lead Sulphide Nanocrystal Conjugated Polymer Bulk Hetero-junction Photovoltaics</field><field name="creator">Mr Andrew Watt</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159444</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beachcomber's Bed</field><field name="creator">Ms Jillian Watkinson</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">420000 Language and Culture</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159446</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Human CD4+ T Memory Cells Maintained with IL-7, IL-15 and Myeloid Dendritic Cells Generate T Regulatory Cells with Enhanced Suppressor Function</field><field name="creator">Mr Adam Mckinlay</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159458</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Avian patch occupancy and landscape genetics of logrunners (Orthonyx temminckii) in fragmented subtropical rainforests of South East Queensland</field><field name="creator">David Charles Pavlacky Jr.</field><field name="description">The local extinction of habitat patches and dispersal between the patches are important processes structuring animal populations in heterogeneous environments. Understanding these two processes is crucial for the conservation of wildlife populations in landscapes impacted by human land-use. Approximately 50% of the subtropical rainforest in South East Queensland, Australia has been lost to deforestation over the last 100 years. While large areas of rainforest are reserved, little is known about the distribution and population status of rainforest birds within smaller remnants in the region. The overall research problem for this thesis was to understand how deforestation and fragmentation of subtropical rainforest affects the occurrence of rainforest birds and the effective dispersal of a rainforest-restricted species, the logrunner (Orthonyx temminckii). Understanding why some bird species are lost from habitat patches while others remain will lead to improved conservation of extinction prone species in fragmented landscapes. Although the mechanisms underlying local extinctions are well established in temperate systems, the relative importance of local and regional processes on species occurrence in subtropical and tropical rainforests is poorly understood. Chapter 2 investigated the relative effects of life history and scale of habitat modification on avian site occupancy using observational data collected at 46 rainforest sites in South East Queensland. A probabilistic model for the joint site occupancy of 29 bird species was used to evaluate hypotheses for the effects of avian life history traits on the occurrence of multiple species. The single-species occurrence models incorporated habitat effects on detection, which may be especially important in rainforests because dense vegetation and idiosyncratic occurrence of species can interfere with sampling. Occupancy rates for each species were modelled to determine the relative influence of process operating at the stand, landscape and patch scales. The life history analysis indicated taxonomic Family, body mass, migratory strategy and feeding strata had large effects on avian site occupancy, whereas abundance traits such as mean density and extent of occurrence showed little predictive ability. After accounting for correlated extinction risk attributed to life history, the degradation of stand structure at the local scale was more important for species richness than habitat modification at landscape or patch scales. While individual species showed various responses to the different scales of habitat modification, the distribution of many species was limited by vegetation structure at the landscape scale. Maintaining stand basal area and restoring degraded rainforests at the local scale will increase the probability of occupancy for members of the rainforest bird community. However, revegetation and retention of forest cover at the landscape scale may be necessary for the successful colonisation of many species. Chapter 3 introduced a predictive hypothesis-driven approach for quantifying the relative contribution of historic and contemporary processes to genetic connectivity. Current analytic frameworks in population genetics have difficulty evaluating meaningful hypotheses about spatial processes in dynamic landscapes. Confronting genetic data with models of historic and contemporary landscapes allowed the identification of dispersal processes operating in naturally heterogeneous and human-altered systems. Two measures of indirect gene flow were estimated from microsatellite polymorphism among 11 logrunner populations. Of particular interest was how much information in the genetic data was attributable to processes occurring in a reconstructed historic landscape and a contemporary human-modified landscape. A linear mixed model was used to estimate appropriate sampling variance from non-independent data and information-theoretic model selection provided strength of evidence for alternate hypotheses. The historic and contemporary landscapes explained an equal proportion of variation in genetic differentiation and there was considerable evidence for a temporal shift in dispersal pattern. Migration rates estimated from genealogical information were primarily influenced by contemporary landscape change. Landscape heterogeneity appeared to facilitate gene flow prior to European settlement, but contemporary deforestation is rapidly becoming the most important barrier to logrunner dispersal. Understanding asymmetric dispersal is becoming an important consideration for the conservation metapopulations. Populations acting as net exporters of dispersing animals may be able to rescue local populations from extinction and allow metapopulations to persist in degraded landscapes impacted by habitat loss. In Chapter 4, I estimated bidirectional migration rates from genetic data to infer dispersal among 11 logrunner populations. The first question posed was, does logrunner dispersal correspond to the source-sink or balanced model of dispersal? The second question involved determining the strength of evidence for two hypotheses about how landscape structure has affected asymmetric dispersal. Hypothesis one proposed that asymmetric dispersal was primarily influenced by naturally occurring habitat heterogeneity. Hypothesis two asserted that asymmetric dispersal was predominantly influenced by anthropogenic landscape change. The data were confronted with the alternate hypotheses using linear mixed models and landscape covariates extracted from digital maps. The results showed the direction of asymmetric dispersal was consistent with source-sink population structure. I also discovered that the asymmetry in dispersal was influenced more by anthropogenic landscape change than by naturally occurring habitat heterogeneity. Intact landscapes were net exporters of dispersing logrunners while landscapes heavily impacted by rainforest clearing were net importers of individuals. Elevated immigration rates into landscapes impacted by rainforest clearing appeared to arrest population declines in accordance with the rescue effect. The primary conclusion emerging from the study of patch occupancy and dispersal was that logrunner populations in South East Queensland conformed to a mainland-island metapopulation. Asymmetric dispersal from the largest expanse of upland rainforest appeared to prevent fragmented rainforests in close proximity from going locally extinct. While the distribution of logrunners was limited by the spatial configuration of rainforest patches, other rainforest birds exhibited variable responses to scale of habitat modification. The most consistent pattern was several species dropping-out of the community in degraded stands affected by selective timber harvest. Deforestation at the landscape scale also played a role in the extremely low patch occupancy rates of Albert&#8217;s lyrebirds (Menura alberti) and green catbirds (Ailuroedus crassirostris).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Asymmetric dispersal, bird conservation, coalescent theory, forest fragmentation, gene flow, habitat loss, life history, migration, notophyll vine forest, species richness.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159461</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a paratransgenic approach to control Fiji leaf gall in sugarcane</field><field name="creator">Mr Grant Hughes</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159463</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Early rheumatoid arthritis, inflammation and cardiovascular disease</field><field name="creator">Suad Hannawi</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Early rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular, carotid intima-media thickness, atheroscerotic plaques, brachial reactivity, endothelium-dependent dilatation, glyceryle trinitrate-mediated dilatation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159482</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Standardized Introductory Formats" in public speaking events: an ethnomethodological analysis of getting to topic</field><field name="creator">Carolyn Brown</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">public speaking, ethnomethodology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159485</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Concept of an archipelagic state and its implementation in Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Puspitawati, Dhiana</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159498</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel Prognostic markers in head and neck cancers</field><field name="creator">Chin, David W.

Tomkins</field><field name="description">The dissertation examines the efficacy of trade union membership growth strategies. The dissertation&#8217;s central argument is that current union strategies will have a limited impact on membership growth. While unions are potential agents of membership growth, the scope of this agency is contingent on the resources they have at their disposal. Unions have a central position in generating the propensity and opportunity to unionise; they possess important human resources that link the organisation to employees; and they have the capacity to convert ideas into action so as to implement growth strategies. However, unions are resource dependent and without such resources unions are limited in what they can do. The dissertation employs quantitative techniques to analyse organisational-level census data drawn from the Australian National Trade Union Survey conducted in 1996. This is a unique source of data providing useful information on the key strategies and approaches unions have employed to promote membership growth. The dissertation&#8217;s principal findings are: that key aspects of the organising model were inadequate in promoting membership growth; internal organising strategies tended to fail under adverse circumstances; new technologies did not generally aid organising; and non-industrial services were inadequate in promoting growth under adverse conditions. Only where appropriate resources were developed and utilised, did current strategies promote membership growth. Organising model strategies performed better where restructuring achieved economies of scale and reduced membership competition. Workplace delegates promoted growth, generally, under adverse circumstances and where membership competition was at a minimum</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field

This research explores the formation and contents of legislation for protecting the rights of broadcasting organisations and analyses the current issues by means of a comparative study of Australian and Japanese law. The thesis starts with an introduction setting out the parameters of the argument, examination of previous research in relation to the topic, explanation of two approaches to the protection of broadcasters&#8217; rights, the hypothesis, the scope, the material covered and the structure of the thesis. It then provides a detailed explanation of the key concepts (broadcasting, broadcasting organisation and the rights of broadcasting organisations). The research analyses the legal context in which those concepts operate in order to establish the scope of the legal inquiry into the rights of broadcasting organisations. The thesis then examines the international conventions and transnational legislation regarding protection of the rights of broadcasting organisations in order to provide a complete picture of the current situation at the international level. Following analysis of the present situation, the thesis examines the new communication technologies and critically reviews the ongoing discussions for the reform of the current international protection of the rights of broadcasting organisations by the Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights in the World Intellectual Property Organisation. The thesis argues that the problems that broadcasting organisations are currently facing stem from the unsatisfactory understanding of the rationale for the protection of broadcasters&#8217; rights. The thesis further argues from the analysis of the Australian Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) as representative of the common law or copyright approach that the rationale for the protection of broadcasters&#8217; rights are in transition. This view is further advanced by the findings obtained as a result of analysis of the Japanese Copyright Law as representative of the civil law approach. The research reveals that the rationale for protection under Japanese law has long been misconceived. The research concludes that the current difficulties in considering the effective reform of the protection of the rights of broadcasting organisations both at the international and national level arose out of the lack of understanding of the rationale for protection.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159945</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic and Epidemiological Studies of Novel Orbiviruses: the identification and characterisation of novel viruses of the genus Orbivirus isolated from sentinel cattle and insects in northern Australia</field><field name="creator">Mr Christopher Cowled</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">virus, arbovirus, reoviridae, orbivirus, genetics, sequencing, epidemiology, cattle, arthropod, insect</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159983</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Friedrich List and Economic Development in East Asia</field><field name="creator">Mr Simon Ridings</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:160002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermodynamic Modelling and its Application for Predicting the Behaviour of Coal Mineral Matter</field><field name="creator">Mr Dmitry Saulov</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:160060</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of temperature on the accumulation and repair of UV damage in Symbiodinium and corals</field><field name="creator">Ms Ruth Reef</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ultraviolet radiation, DNA, coral, Symbiodinium, photolyase, MAA, skeleton, climate change, ocean acidification, global warming</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:160279</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Atom detection and counting in ultracold gases using photoionisation and ion detection</field><field name="creator">Tom Campey</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="subject">atom optics, BEC, atom counting, number squeezing, photoionisation, ion detection</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:160338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constructions of &#8216;community engagement&#8217;

This information prompted the present research, which traces the tradition back to the earliest known examples on Late Neolithic Cyprus, and tracks its evolution through to the Cypro-Archaic period. Rather than rely upon descriptions, photographs and drawings presented in consulted publications, the various international museums that house the figures were visited by the writer in order to physically examine the images. Controversial aspects of these figures were discussed with senior museum staff and/or curators. If figurines were unavailable for viewing, where possible, photographs were acquired from the relevant museums, and controversial aspects of the figures discussed by email. As a result, the majority of the images discussed in this thesis have been examined and photographed by the author. A catalogue of the sexually ambiguous imagery for Cyprus from the Neolithic to the Cypro-Archaic period has been compiled and is included in this work. It is proposed that the imagery is of Cypriot innovation, and consists of proto-anthropomorphic, anthropomorphic and half-animal, half-human representations. The genre is influenced from its earliest period by the figurative art of the Syro-Anatolian mainland, but from the Late Bronze Age onwards, influences from the western Mediterranean and Aegean are also evident. Despite the periods in which there is little evidence for figurine production, sexually ambivalent imagery re-emerges when figurative evidence is once more apparent in the archaeological records. Furthermore, stylistic continuity of the genre from one period to the next is also apparent. This continuity is regardless of the cultural changes which occur intermittently during the seven millennia period relevant to this study. Although it is not until the Cypro-Geometric period that there is firm evidence to support a religious interpretation of sexually equivocal imagery, it is suggested that the genre from the earliest period was at least associated with fertility, and perhaps religious cult.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cyprus, neolithic, bronze age, cypro-geometric, cypro-archaic, figurative art, androgyny, dualsexed, sexual ambiguity, ancient religion</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:160605</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of Gaseous Ammonia on the Health and Welfare of Sheep (Ovis aries) and Cattle (Bos taurus)</field><field name="creator">Ms Tracy Greer</field><field name="description">Sea transportation of sheep and cattle, exported from Australia to the Middle East, involves extended journeys in compromising conditions including high ambient temperatures, high relative humidity, high stocking rates, the movement of the ship and high ammonia levels. Little is known about the effects of ammonia on livestock on board these vessels, particularly sheep. Two experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of various concentrations of ammonia on the health and welfare of sheep and cattle. In experiment 1, sheep and cattle were held in climate controlled chambers simulating the conditions on board a 12 day (d) journey from Australia to the Middle East. They were exposed to four ammonia concentrations while a comprehensive assessment of behavior, dietary intake, weight change, lung pathology and haematological parameters associated with immunocompetence and stress was conducted. In experiment 2, a choice test Y-maze was established where two groups of sheep were trained to press a lever, one previously exposed to ammonia, to enter the maze based on the presence of a food reward and subsequently the persistence to press the lever once the maze was filled with ammonia was assessed. Ammonia concentrations typical of those on board a livestock vessel had an influence on live weight gain, the time spent standing and panting in the steers and locomotion in the wethers. Results also showed that lacrimation, nasal discharge and coughing increased with ammonia treatment in the steers. There was evidence that ammonia irritated the respiratory surfaces of both wethers and steers with increased macrophage activity and iv neutrophil count. Results showed a partial aversion of sheep entering a chamber of 45 parts per million (ppm) atmospheric ammonia, however it was also shown that previous exposure to ammonia did not influence the aversion to entering the chamber for a food reward. Ammonia concentrations on board livestock vessels reach concentrations which inflict changes in the livestock's behavioral and physiological well being. These concentrations however, may not be prevalent enough to cause concern. Other behavioral changes directly attributed to increases in wet and dry bulb temperature, may be of a concern to the animals&#146; welfare. Even so, both atmospheric conditions may be managed on board vessels dually using air ventilation practices. Given that results showed that ammonia had an effect on live weight gain, the causation of this should be further investigated as it could benefit the industry's profitability.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:160636</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biology and Population Ecology of Manta Birostris in Southern Mozambique</field><field name="creator">Andrea Denise Marshall</field><field name="description">Despite being the world&#8217;s largest batoid fish, manta rays have been the focus of very little research in the last century. Almost nothing is currently known about their ecology or distribution throughout the world&#8217;s oceans. Manta rays are considered to be near-threatened to vulnerable by the World Conservation Union&#8217;s Redlist of endangered species, yet many populations still face threats from target fishing for their fin cartilage, branchial filaments and meat. The taxonomic history of the genus Manta has been questionable and convoluted,with Manta having one of the most extensive generic and species synonymies of any living genus of cartilaginous fish. Currently this genus is considered to be monotypicwith a single recognized species, Manta birostris. Behavioural and morphological data collected during this study showed that there are two distinct, sympatric species of manta ray in Mozambique. This discovery has led to an examination of manta ray distribution worldwide, with the two species hypothesis receiving further support from study sites in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. This thesis examined large populations of both putative species in Mozambique. Development and application of a photographic-identification methodology allowed identification of individuals based on their unique ventral surface markings (spots). The ability to recognise individuals enabled many aspects of both populations to be examined. A total of 449 individual rays were identified of Manta birostris variant A and 101 individual rays were identified of Manta birostris variant B. Both populations exhibited a highly significant female bias in observed sex ratios of 1:3.5 and 1:7.4 respectively. The photographic identification approach was used in studies of population size and structure and to examine the reproductive ecology of these two distinct populations. Population estimates incorporating four years of re-sighting data on Manta birostris variant A and five years of data on Manta birostris variant B were conducted using the program MARK resulting in super population estimates of 890 and 600 individuals respectively. The region encompassing the study site was identified as a mating ground for Manta birostris variant A based on observations of mating events and fresh pectoral fin tip scars on female rays produced when the male rays bite onto the fins during copulation. The distribution of scars was highly biased, with 99% on the left pectoral fin, indicative of a strong lateralised behavioural trait in this species. No other elasmobranch has been reported to display behavioural lateralisation. The study region also acts as a birthing ground, with individuals giving birth in the summer after a gestation period of approximately one year. Reproductive periodicity in M. birostris variant A was most commonly biennial, but a few individuals were seen to be pregnant in consecutive years, confirming an annual ovulatory cycle. The production of a single pup appears to be the normal situation, although observations in the wild as well as during opportunistic dissections of individuals killed in fisheries revealed that two pups are conceived on occasion. Morphometric analysis of late-term foetus (M. birostris variant A) was contrasted with measurements taken from adult rays. These are the only detailed measurements on M. birostris variant A from the western Indian Ocean. Predatory scarring and bite injuries on individuals of both variant A and B were consistent with attacks from sharks of various sizes. The frequency and effect of these predatory injuries on the two populations were examined over a three-year period. Acoustic tags were attached to fourteen rays and their presence/absence at sites around the major inshore reefs was explored to evaluate how the rays utilised their environment on a temporal scale. Cleaning activity of both putative species of manta rays by small fishes occurred on these reefs and was considered to be the main reason why the rays were present at these sites. Parasite removal and wound healing were implicated as the benefits received. Host cleaner fish species partition the manta ray body to avoid interspecific competition while the two putative species appear to partition cleaning habitats, with very little overlap apparent. This research on manta rays is the first of its kind in African waters. Many aspects of the study have contributed to the limited baseline data currently available for this genus. The study additionally provided sufficient empirical evidence to warrant the separation of these two putative species of Manta and a full revision of the genus with the systematic examination of specimens throughout Manta&#8217;s range. The results of this study may be useful in this endeavour as diagnostic characteristics have been isolated that may help to differentiate members of this genus. The results of this research study are directly applicable to management strategies for both putative species of manta rays off the East Coast of Africa as well as populations worldwide and have highlighted the potential need for different conservation strategies</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Elasmobranch, Manta ray, Population biology, Taxonomy, Morphology, Reproduction</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:160974</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploration into the vocabulary presented in mathematical and word problems. A presentation of practical student tasks challenging teachers&#8217; assumptions about the accessibility of Year 9 test items.</field><field name="creator">Emilia Sinton</field><field name="description">The unique language of mathematics incorporates words, numbers, symbols and diagrams. These elements and their associated mathematical concepts introduce reading and comprehension requirements that are not experienced in other disciplines. It is the responsibility of teachers to ensure that students are educated about, and encouraged to apply mathematical language in a variety of contexts. This is essential to the development of mathematical problem solving, where word problems often feature in classroom instruction and assessment, and where mathematical language is expected within student responses. Mathematics teachers need to be mindful that the validity of test items used to assess student mathematical problem solving ability are not influenced by other variables such as vocabulary comprehension difficulty. This study discusses the vocabulary which Year 9 students identify as difficult when undertaking word problem tasks in pen and paper test situations. To challenge generalised assumptions that teachers may make, this study focused on development of an instrument to monitor and evaluate the vocabulary comprehension of individual students within the classroom, and with respect to their particular school context. Analyses of findings support the requirement of reading proficiency in mathematics, and in particular, of vocabulary comprehension to student performance on mathematical problem solving assessment comprised of word problems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mathematics, problem solving, vocabulary, word problems, assessment.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:161115</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutriomic analysis of fresh and processed fruits through the development of an in-vitro model of human digestive system</field><field name="creator">Ms Indah Epriliati</field><field name="description">Nutriomics is the study of the whole range of nutritional components (nutriome) in foods. In order to further understand the molecular basis for the positive health benefits of fruits identified from epidemiology, the mass balance through the human digestion and absorption should be studied. The components of the nutriome studied in this research were sugars, carotenoids, phenolics and organic acids, all important for defining dietary &#8211; human health relationships and linking to evidence obtained from epidemiological studies. An attempt to approach a realistic human mimetic digestion and absorption model has been carried out in this study using a static in-vitro model of the human digestive system. Two major novelities in this model compared to other in-vitro models are (i) the use of particles of solid fruit products that mimic the products of human chewing and (ii) a cell-based (Caco-2) in-vitro intestinal absorption model. Hence, imitative bioavailability, i.e. releasing nutrients and potential levels of target compounds reaching the portal circulatory system could be assessed. The fruits studied were tomato, mango, papaya; each as fresh, dried and juiced forms. In-vivo chewing suggested 0.5 cm size modes for dried products and 1.5 cm for fresh products. The agglomerates that were obtained from the chewing of dried products disaggregated during in-vitro digestions in the presence of acids (gastric simulation) or sodium bicarbonate at pH 6 (small intestinal simulation). The extent of this disaggregation followed the order: tomato &gt; mango &gt; papaya. Although all fresh samples contained separated cells, their responses to a 5 mm texture analysis probe (mimicking teeth cusps) varied depending on fruit products. All matrices were hardened by drying, becoming more brittle and breaking easier to produce smaller size modes. Variation between individual participants in the size of their chewed particles was lower for fresh products and high for dried products. The in-vitro digestion and absorption model developed had simulated particle sizes of approximately 0.5 cm3 for dried products or 1.5 cm3 (thickness varied with the products) for fresh products in a 9:1 ratio mix with blended samples, and were digested in-vitro using the following steps: 1. &#8216;Chewing&#8217;: pH 6.9; 37 C, 10 min, in a shaking-water bath (55 rpm) with human alpha-amylase (100 U/L). 2. &#8216;Gastric&#8217; digestion: pH 2; 37 C, 60 min, in a shaking-water (55 rpm) with porcine pepsin (40 &#181;g/L). 3. &#8216;Intestinal&#8217; digestion: pH 6; 37 C, 60 min, in a shaking-water bath (55 rpm) with porcine pancreatin and bile extract (1.4 &#181;g/L and 8.6 &#181;g/L, respectively). 4. Caco-2 cell monolayer in-vitro passages: aged 22 days post confluent monolayers in a 24 transwell-insert well plate seeded at 105 cells, pH 7.4 with renewal of apical and basolateral solutions every 30 min for bioavailability estimations. In this study, two models of basolateral &#8211; apical solution renewals were carried out: both apical and basolateral were renewed (model A) and basolateral only was renewed (model B). To study metabolites produced by Caco-2 cells, the bioassays were carried out for 22 h without renewals of apical and basolateral solutions (model C). An overview of nutriomics analysis of in-vitro digestions of mango, papaya and tomato based on principal component analysis (PCA) suggested: (1) fruit types led to variable nutriome releases: in-vitro digestions affected tomato &gt;mango &gt;papaya; (2) processing varied nutriome releases from fruit products with juicing tended to release more nutriome components, whereas drying and unprocessed (fresh) did not show noticeably different patterns; (3) gastric and simultaneous gastric-intestinal digestions were similar in nutriome releases whereas contributions of intestinal digestion alone were negligible for water soluble nutriome components; and overall (4) during in-vitro digestions there were no interactions among releasing nutriome from the fruit products studied (independent nutriome releasing processes). Phenolic components showed molecular changes during in-vitro digestion and processing, due to, heating effects, pH or enzymic degradations. Caco-2 bioassays using model compounds showed a range of monolayer responses as follows: (1) mannitol, lycopene and catechin were strictly retained in the apical solution; (2) sugars, caffeine and atenolol were translocated in the apical-to-basolateral direction as intact molecules; (3) Beta-carotene partially disappeared from the apical solution without basolateral release. Models A &#8211; C consistently confirmed these responses. Low recoveries provided evidence for cellular metabolisms of (particularly) phenolic and carotenoid molecules by the Caco-2 cell monolayers.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nutriomic analysis</field><field name="subject">fruits</field><field name="subject">fresh</field><field name="subject">juiced</field><field name="subject">dried</field><field name="subject">in-vitro</field><field name="subject">human digestion</field><field name="subject">Caco-2 Cell</field><field name="subject">PCA</field><field name="subject">Simultaneous Analysis</field><field name="subject">Sugar</field><field name="subject">phenolics</field><field name="subject">carotenoids</field><field name="subject">organic acids</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:161205</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Indigenous Narratives of Success: Exploring Conversation Groups as Research Methodology with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Students at The University of Queensland</field><field name="creator">Mrs Janice Stewart</field><field name="description">This thesis constructs and verifies a methodological practice of conversation groups and grounded theory for examining and changing the dominant discourse that situates Indigenous Australian tertiary students in mainstream education. Within this research, not only was a rich shared discourse development on a conceptual level valuable and necessary in the telling of our stories but it offered us as co-researchers&#8212;Indigenous students and a non-Indigenous researcher&#8212;a means of revealing and working through understandings and mis-understandings. Using such a methodological approach also suggested future possibilities for effective Indigenous/non-Indigenous stakeholders&#8217; working relationships in research, and possibly policy-making in Australian institutions generally. As a methodological and communicative tool for opening up a dialogic space, the use of conversation groups for developing effective communicative relationships held promise for highlighting the experiences of Indigenous students who themselves, then negotiated the position for theoretically and pragmatically directing individual and collective decisions and actions. Inviting Indigenous students into this space provided an environment for the development of an Indigenous standpoint, which is not merely an Indigenous opinion but requires an engagement with the questions and issues affecting Indigenous students as interdependent individuals. Such a standpoint does not happen automatically and needs opportunities to grow and mature. I found that conversation groups involving the Indigenous students and me working together as co-researchers provided this opportunity. With Indigenous students&#8217; narratives of success chosen as the research topic, productively communicating views became a verification of the research methodology used and an enactment of their right to be heard, both highlighting voice and representation issues. The research methodology we used and the ensuing discourse development became an entwined interplay, where each served to reinforce the other. The Indigenous students and I were practising the research approach of conversation groups while developing a conceptualised discourse on being successful. This transdisciplinary approach in co-research, encompassing Indigenous and Western research approaches, allowed for experiential and theoretical engagement with questions of cultural authority, representation, power and agency by Indigenous students and me as a non-Indigenous researcher. Central to the Indigenous students&#8217; stories were notions of &#8220;place&#8221; as created, negotiated and manipulated by successful Indigenous students as they move between and within fluid subjectivities or stances in relationships, time and space. A broader view was taken of how intersections, layers and parallels are negotiated by the Indigenous students within and between multitudes of places in the blurring of living in two worlds: Black and White.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indigenous tertiary students</field><field name="subject">narrative inquiry</field><field name="subject">grounded theory</field><field name="subject">conversation groups</field><field name="subject">success</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:161712</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predictions and perspectives: Exploring the relationship between psychological well-being and substance use by young males and females.</field><field name="creator">Ms Kim Johnston</field><field name="description">Adolescence is a time of experimentation and exploration. For many young people, a feature of this developmental period is the initiation of substance use. Whilst the majority of young people do not go on to develop substance use problems, any substance use has potential for danger. The current body of literature on the prevention of substance use problems suggests that in order to advance understanding, researchers must adopt a risk-focused approach. There is a wide range of indices that have been cited as risk factors for the development of substance use disorders. Chapter 2 explores some of the aetiological models and literature on risk factors with specific reference to psychological wellbeing, studies highlighting comorbid relationships between adolescent mental health and substance use problems, and the functional value of substances in relation to well-being. Although attention to psychological risk factors has received increased press in the literature, the number of controlled, longitudinal studies is relatively small. A review of recent studies (Chapter 3) indicates that the presence of anxiety, depression, low self-esteem or behavioural problems such as delinquency represent psychological risk factors for the development of later substance use problems, however findings are inconsistent and many studies do not examine differential predictive utility by substance or gender. Thus, Study 1 of this research aimed to add to this body of work by exploring the prediction of alcohol, cannabis and other illicit substance use at age fifteen from key indicators of psychological well-being taken at age thirteen. The data from a normative sample of high school students indicated subtle differences in trajectory for young males and females and effects specific to different drug categories. Delinquency emerged as the most consistent predictor in both males and females. Low self-esteem was also an important indicator for future female marijuana use and marijuana intoxication and both male and female other illicit substance use. The findings highlighted the need for a greater contextual understanding of the relationship between delinquency, self-esteem and substance use. The second study sought to provide a deeper understanding of these issues by examining the perceived functional value of substances in relation to psychological wellbeing, by means of a qualitative study of a group of young people who had experienced problems with their substance use. Chapter 4 explores the limited phenomenological research in this area, with a focus on studies which have used methods of measurement that highlight the perspective of young people. Using a Consensual Qualitative Research approach, Study 2 builds on the drug type and gender contrasts noted in Study 1, and explores the interface between substance use and psychological well-being in depth using a clinical population. A number of key functions are identified by young people, with evidence of both convergence and divergence across drug categories (alcohol, cannabis, other illicit substances). Interviewees reported six functions common to all substances; social connectedness, improve affect, positive self-transformation, better coping with problems, fun and laughter, and feeling intoxicated. Nine additional functions were identified in relation to cannabis and other illicit substances. Several gender differences were also noted, with males tending to report more positive reinforcement from alcohol and cannabis, and young females more frequently describing benefits related to use of other illicit substances. The concluding chapter (Chapter 5) reviews the main findings across both studies and their implications for theory, practice, and future research. Overall, the findings of the research provide support for both problem behaviour and adaptive models of adolescent substance use, and indicate that young people are capable of reflecting on their substance use experiences. Incorporating the wisdom of young people into risk frameworks may enhance prevention, education and intervention efforts.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">adolescent, substance misuse, psychological well-being, consensual qualitative research</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:161713</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Refinement of Artificial Insemination in the Koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) with an Emphasis on Male Factor Fertility</field><field name="creator">Mrs. Camryn D Allen</field><field name="description">The overarching theme of this thesis was to gain a better understanding of male koala reproductive biology that would lead to improved outcomes for the application of artificial insemination (AI) in this species. The primary aims of the thesis were centred around (1) the male's contribution to the success of AI with respect to any influence of breeding season (Chapters 2 and 3), (2) the ovulation-induction capacity of the semen in regard to the effect of its dilution and preservation (Chapter 4) and (3) the preliminary development of methods for controlling anterior pituitary (AP) function, leading to the control of oestrus and ultimately the timing of insemination (Chapters 4 and 5). Testosterone secretion in mammals typically occurs in random pulses such that a single blood sample provides limited information on reproductive endocrine status. However, it has been shown in several species that an index of the prevailing testosterone biosynthetic capacity of the testes can be obtained by measuring the increase in circulating plasma testosterone after injection of a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Hence, studies conducted in Chapter 2 examined fluctuations in testosterone secretion of the koala (n = 6) over a 24 h period and then characterised testosterone secretion after injection of the GnRH agonist buserelin (4 &#956;g mL-1) or hCG (1000 IU). The latter was used to establish an index of the prevailing testosterone biosynthetic capacity of the koala testis. Individual koalas showed major changes in blood testosterone concentrations over 24 h but there was no apparent diurnal pattern of testosterone secretion (P &gt; 0.05). Injection of buserelin or hCG resulted in an increase (P &lt; 0.05) in blood plasma testosterone concentration. Near maximal concentrations of plasma testosterone occurred at around 60 min after injection of exogenous hormone. There was a tendency for plasma testosterone to decline after 90 min with buserelin but concentrations following administration of hCG remained near maximum for 240 min. There were strong positive correlations between the average testosterone concentration for each individual koala over 24 h and the maximum observed testosterone concentration after stimulation with GnRH or hCG (GnRH, r = 0.772; P = 0.07 and hCG, r = 1.0; P &lt; 0.01). These findings showed that individual male koalas can show large fluctuations in plasma testosterone concentrations over time and that a GnRH agonist and hCG can be used in the koala to obtain an index of the prevailing steroidogenic capacity of the testes. This technique was then used in Chapter 3 as part of larger study to investigate seasonal changes in male koala reproduction in south-east Queensland (SEQ). The effects of breeding season on male koala fertility have not been investigated in detail so that a better understanding of this phenomenon should help to improve the efficacy of the artificial insemination procedure in this species. Seasonal changes in male reproductive function were assessed in a wild free-range population (n = 14; obtained every six weeks from January to November 2005), a deceased wild population (n = 84; obtained monthly from September to August 2005) and a captive population (n = 7; obtained monthly from October 2005 to October 2006) of koalas in SEQ. In addition to improving AI procedures, this study was also used to determine the practicality of using free-range wild male koalas as potential semen donors for genome resource banks. Examination of a range of reproductive variables initially revealed no significant seasonal change in the 3 koala populations; however, when the data were adjusted to account for individual koalas, their size and/or their health status, the majority of reproductive parameters showed evidence of seasonal variation that was supported by statistical modelling. Relationships between variables were based on simple polynomials, up to a cubic for some variables (Chapter 3, Figures 3 &#8211; 5 and the corresponding discussion). Total testicular volume changed throughout the year in the wild and captive populations with an increase over spring and summer and a decrease in autumn and winter; no such change was detected in the deceased population. Maximum area of the sternal gland stain occurred in spring in both the deceased and captive populations but in winter for the wild free-range population. Total bulbo-urethral gland volume showed an increase over spring, a decrease over summer and autumn and then an increase towards the end of winter. The steroidogenic capacity of the koala testis (testosterone secretion) in both the wild free-range and captive populations showed a peak during spring and a nadir in autumn. The quality of semen samples collected by electroejaculation (EE) from the wild and captive koala populations showed evidence of being influenced by season. Initial percentage motility of the wild population decreased marginally throughout the study and initial rate of sperm movement was highest in winter. Motility of spermatozoa after thawing from the wild koala population was also highest in winter as was the percentage of cryopreserved spermatozoa with intact plasma membranes collected from the captive population. This study has shown that male koala reproduction in SEQ appears to be seasonal and that it is possible to repeatedly collect semen from free-range koalas as potential genetic donors. Nevertheless, the semen quality of captive and wild caught animals may be susceptible to seasonal change and winter seems to be the optimal season in which to collect such samples. Artificial insemination in the koala using chilled, electroejaculated semen provides for a marked improvement in the reproductive and genetic management of captive koala colonies in Australia and internationally, as well as making available the option of using semen collected from wild populations to expand restricted gene pools. Dilution of koala semen for AI is complicated by this species being an induced ovulator and it is thought that ovulating factors are present in the semen; hence semen extension for preservation purposes might be anticipated to result in a failure to induce ovulation. The first two experiments of Chapter 4 were designed to determine whether AI using undiluted, extended and extended-chilled semen collected by EE was capable of inducing a luteal phase and/or the production of pouch young (PY). In Experiment 1, 1 mL of undiluted EE semen, 2 mL of diluted (1:1) semen and 1 mL of diluted (1:1) semen resulted in 7 out of 9, 6 out of 9 and 6 out of 9 koalas showing a luteal phase respectively; 4 PY were produced in each treatment. A second AI experiment was conducted in which 2 mL of diluted (1:1) semen was administered in 3 groups of 9 koalas. The first group received semen that had been collected and diluted immediately without chilling, the second group was deposited with semen stored chilled for 24 h, while the final group received semen that had been chilled for 72 h. In the first group, 5 females had a luteal phase but none became pregnant. In group 2, 2 of the 5 females that had a luteal phase gave birth, while in group 3, 4 of the 6 females that had a luteal phase produced PY. In addition, Experiment 3 was conducted to determine whether it was possible to produce PY by naturally mating koalas that were in the latter stages of their behavioural oestrus; this information is important to the logistics of transporting koala semen for AI by establishing the maximum time frame in which females might be expected to shed a fertile oocyte. Of the 12 females mated on day 8 of oestrus, 6 gave birth, whereas only 3 of the 10 females naturally mated on day 10 of oestrus produced PY. The majority of females (21 out of 22) in Experiment 3 showed evidence of a luteal phase. Together, these experiments have shown that it is possible to use undiluted, extended or extended-chilled semen to produce koala offspring, up to day 8 of oestrus, at conception rates similar to those achieved following natural mating. These findings represent a significant advancement in the use of reproductive technology in marsupials and provide the basis for the shipment of koala semen over long distances. The PY produced in this study represent the first marsupials born following AI of extended-chilled semen and bring the total number of koalas produced by AI to 31. The final series of experiments conducted in Chapter 5 explored the efficacy of GnRH analogues to control the koala AP as a preliminary investigation for the development of methods of oestrus control. The aim of Chapter 5 was to determine whether analogues of GnRH could be used to both induce an acute testosterone response and suppress anterior pituitary function in male koalas, and induce a luteal phase in female koalas. Experiment 1 characterised the steroidogenic response of male koalas to administration of 30 &#956;g (4.3 &#956;g kg-1) natural sequence GnRH. Injection IM of natural sequence GnRH induced the release of LH and testosterone with respective peak concentrations at 30 min (3.7 &#177; 1.9 ng mL-1) and 2 h (5.4 &#177; 0.5 ng mL-1). In Experiment 2, a single injection of the GnRH antagonist acyline [100 &#956;g (14.3 &#956;g kg-1) or 500 &#956;g (71.4 &#956;g kg-1)] did not influence the testosterone response to subsequent injections of natural sequence GnRH. In Experiment 3, 4 &#956;g (&#8776;0.67 &#956;g kg-1) of the GnRH agonist buserelin induced a luteal phase in five female koalas based on a LH surge, secretion of progestogen, and a normal length oestrous cycle. The findings have shown (1) natural sequence GnRH can be used to test gonadotroph cell function and determine the testosterone secreting capacity of male koalas, (2) the GnRH antagonist, acyline, at the dose rates used does not suppress the pituitary-testis axis in male koalas, and (3) the GnRH agonist, buserelin, induces a normal luteal phase in female koalas. Overall, this thesis has resulted in an improved understanding of koala reproductive biology as it relates to the further refinement of AI and the contribution of the male. A total of 31 koala PY, 18 conceived during this study, have now been produced following AI, making the koala AI program one of the most successful assisted breeding programs for wildlife species in the world. The findings of this thesis are essential for the next step in the development of this technology, the production of koala pouch following insemination of frozen-thawed spermatozoa and the establishment of a functional genome resource bank for the species.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:161715</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of Vaccines and Therapeutics for West Nile Virus</field><field name="creator">Mr David Clark</field><field name="description">West Nile virus (WNV) has a worldwide distribution, with this virus having been isolated on all continents except Antarctica. The recent emergence of highly pathogenic strains of WNV associated with increased rates of neurological disease is of great concern given this broad distribution of the virus. Although two vaccines have been licensed for veterinary use, no prophylactic measures have been approved for humans. Similarly, no antivirals are currently available for post-exposure treatment of WNV. Indeed, few therapeutic agents have shown promise when administered after WNV infection in animal models. KUNV is a highly attenuated, Australasian lineage 1 strain of WNV. This attenuation is mediated in part by the limited neuroinvasiveness of this virus. Phylogenetically, KUNV clusters with pathogenic lineage 1 WNV strains, including the isolates which have been associated with 997 deaths in North America since 1999. Recently, it was shown that mice exposed to KUNV were effectively protected from challenge with pathogenic WNV. The KUNV strain used in that study possessed a single amino acid substitution in NS1 protein that affected oligomerization of this protein, resulting in reduced virus replication in vitro and increased attenuation in mice. In the present study, further characterization of this attenuation marker in NS1 protein was undertaken to determine whether it is suitable for inclusion in a live-attenuated KUNV vaccine. Similarly, mapping of the residues that contribute to the dimerization domain surrounding NS1 protein was performed to identify other potential attenuation markers for stabilization of KUNV attenuation. The mutant viruses created in this study also were manipulated to characterize the role of NS1 protein dimerization in flavivirus replication. The results of this work indicate that NS1 protein dimerization is not absolutely required for virus replication or production of secreted oligomers of NS1 protein, which are important for eliciting protective humoral responses. Although replication of KUNV was found to be highly dependent on retention of the conserved amino acid sequence within the dimerization domain, two mutant viruses were generated by introducing substitutions at residue 250 of NS1 protein. The resultant viruses demonstrated reduced replication in vitro and attenuation in mice. Similarly, a non-conservative substitution in NS2A, which was previously shown to reduce the resistance of KUNV to the host interferon response, was able to attenuate KUNV in mice. Inoculation of adult mice with viruses containing mutations at either site afforded complete protection from lethal WNV challenge. However, the substitutions described in the dimerization domain of NS1 protein were unstable, with restoration of virulence being observed in mutant viruses after limited passaging in vitro. Concerns over the stability of attenuating mutations in KUNV and the time taken to characterize new attenuation markers prompted the evaluation of a novel approach to the development of rationally-designed flavivirus vaccines. The introduction of large complements of synonymous codon substitutions reduced KUNV replication in vertebrate cells. Escape mutations were not observed in a KUNV vaccine candidate containing 37 rare codons after repeated passaging in vertebrate cells at a low MOI. Replication of KUNV in C6/36 cells was unaffected by the introduction of large numbers of rare codons, indicating that this cell line exerts limited selective pressure on the codon composition of this virus. This observation indicates that C6/36 cells may be a useful cell line for the propagation of viruses containing this type of mutation. Finally, three monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) which bind to WNV envelope (E) protein were observed to potently neutralize the pathogenic NY99 strain of WNV. Passive administration of one of these antibodies was shown to afford mice protection even when administered seven days after challenge with WNV NY99 strain. Remarkably, this is the same time that mortality is first observed in control groups. These antibodies mapped to the putative receptor binding domain (domain 3) of E protein. However, these antibodies were found to block virus replication at a stage after receptor-binding. Homology modeling was used to propose a mechanism for the blockade of virus infection mediated by MAb binding. This study describes the development and characterization of a promising new vaccine as well as candidate immunotherapeutics for the prophylaxis and post-exposure treatment of WNV disease. This work described herein also has implications for the development of vaccines and antivirals for other flaviviral diseases.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vaccine</field><field name="subject">Immunotherapeutic</field><field name="subject">Antibody</field><field name="subject">West Nile virus</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:161734</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiological assessment of lingual function in adults with apraxia of speech</field><field name="creator">Meyer, Carly</field><field name="description">Apraxia of speech (AOS) is a neurogenic speech disorder that is characterised by deficits in the articulatory and prosodic domains of speech production. A range of physiologic assessment techniques have been employed in an attempt to elucidate the physiological underpinnings of articulatory and prosodic defects in AOS. However, despite the advancement of electromagnetic articulography (EMA), a technique that facilitates safe, non-invasive assessment of intra-oral structures, little research has investigated lingual kinematics during speech production in participants with AOS. Tongue-to-palate contact patterns, on the contrary, have been investigated in AOS. However, most of this research relied upon descriptive analysis, rather than instrumental techniques including electropalatography (EPG). Therefore, the present thesis aimed to utilise EMA and EPG to provide a comprehensive assessment of lingual movement and tongue-to-palate contact patterns during word-initial consonant singletons and consonant clusters, during mono- and multisyllabic words, in AOS. The strength of coupling between the tongue and jaw and tongue-tip and tongue-back was also examined, as was consonant cluster coarticulation. Five participants (three females and two males) with AOS and a concomitant non-fluent aphasia participated in the project. The mean age of the group at the time of the EMA assessment was 53.6 years (SD = 12.60; range 35 - 67 years). At the time of initial assessment, all participants were a minimum of 12 months post onset of stroke (M = 1.67 years; SD = 0.72). Perceptual analysis indicated that each of the five participants with AOS presented with the following mandatory characteristics: sound distortions, sound prolongations, syllabic speech output, and dysprosody. A control group of 12 neurologically unimpaired participants (8 male, 4 female; M = 52.08 years; SD = 12.52; age range = 29 - 70 years) also participated in the study. The apraxic speakers&#8217; tongue-tip and tongue-back movements were initially profiled during monosyllabic word production using EMA. Movement duration, distance, maximum velocity, maximum acceleration and deceleration, and velocity profile index values were recorded during word-initial consonant singletons (i.e., /t, s, l, k/) and consonant clusters (i.e., /kl, sk/). Results indicated that the participants with AOS evidenced significantly prolonged movement durations and, in some instances, significantly greater articulatory distances, relative to the control group. All measures pertaining to speed appeared to be relatively unimpaired. Phonetic complexity had a variable impact on the articulation of word-initial consonants. The results were able to account for the overall slow rate of speech exhibited by the participants with AOS. In a subsequent study, EMA was employed to investigate the impact of increasing word length on lingual kinematics for five participants with AOS. Target consonant singletons and consonant clusters were embedded in the word-initial position of one, two, and three syllable words (e.g., tar, target, targeting). Movement duration appeared to be most sensitive to the effect of word length during consonant singleton production. However, word length effects were absent during consonant cluster production. The data were discussed in the context of motor theories of speech production. The final EMA investigation examined the strength of coupling between the tongue and jaw and tongue-tip and tongue-back during /ta, sa, la, ka/ syllable repetitions, in a group of five participants with AOS. In comparison to the control group, four participants with AOS exhibited significantly stronger articulatory coupling for alveolar and/or velar targets, indicative of decreased functional movement independence. The reduction in functional movement independence was thought to reflect an attempt to simplify articulatory control, or alternatively, a decrease in the ability to differentially control distinct articulatory regions. To complement the EMA data, EPG was employed to investigate the spatial characteristics of linguopalatal contact during word-initial consonant singletons (i.e., /t, s, l, k/) and consonant clusters (i.e., /kl, sk/) in three participants with AOS. Through the use of quantitative and qualitative analysis techniques, misdirected articulatory gestures (e.g., double articulation patterns), distorted linguopalatal contact patterns (alveolar fricatives), lingual overshoot, and for one participant, significantly greater spatial variability were identified in the linguopalatal contact data. Pattern of closure appeared to be relatively unimpaired during alveolar plosive and approximant productions, and lingual undershoot and true omission errors were absent. The results were discussed in relation to their impact on phonetic distortion. A subsequent EPG study examined the temporal and spatial aspects of consonant cluster coarticulation in three participants with AOS. Target stimuli included &#8216;scar&#8217; and &#8216;class&#8217;. In contrast to what was expected, each of the participants with AOS appeared able to coproduce elements within a consonant cluster. Appropriately, pattern of linguopalatal contact did not appear to be influenced by coproduction. Amount of linguopalatal contact did differ significantly on occasion. Coarticulatory effects were appropriately absent for each of the participants with AOS during alveolar fricative production in &#8216;scar&#8217;; however, the control group and each of the apraxic speakers exhibited place of articulation assimilation during velar stop production. The control group and two participants with AOS produced discrete velar and alveolar articulations during &#8216;class&#8217;; one participant with AOS evidenced coarticulatory effects during the /kl/ cluster. The research findings indicated that consonant cluster coarticulation was generally maintained in word-onset position, and it was postulated that future research should endeavour to investigate consonant cluster coarticulation in consonant sequences that span a syllable boundary. The EMA and EPG research findings presented in this thesis inform about the underlying physiological nature of articulatory disturbances in AOS.

By 1975 there were several thousand Spaniards, of which the majority had travelled directly to Queensland to settle permanently. The thesis uses a chronological structure to trace the development of Spanish political and cultural identities in Queensland over the seventy-five year period. Early settlers were strongly influenced by radical anarchism, and were engaged in ideological debates and Queensland industrial disputes that referenced patterns of behaviour throughout the Hispanic world. Later settlers were predominantly Basques, and used political associations and cultural events to project their identity and to engage with Queensland society. Queensland&#8217;s Spanish communities were never defined simply in terms of ethnicity, nationality or political persuasion. Their cultural and political identity was the product of dynamic interactions between social narratives and transnational and local spaces. Spanish identities were the result of an ongoing and complex dialogue between experiences in Spain and Queensland, which channelled migrants&#8217; memories and expectations. Spaniards were deeply involved in Queensland politics for the entire period of their settlement. Their engagement involved the application and modification of Spanish models of political and cultural action to the Queensland environment. Memories and behaviours were re-articulated through a dialogue that referenced events in Queensland and Spain, and debated their future implications to the local communities. The thesis does not try to separate migrants&#8217; political and cultural identity. Cultural norms enacted in Queensland provided models to achieve both political and social goals in Australia and Spain. Later migrants used ethnic networks to assert their cultural difference, in processes that often had clear political implications. Queenslanders were tolerant of what were seen as folk cultures, and were rarely attuned to the political discussions that underpinned regional ethnicities. Yet, within the Spanish communities, tensions regarding the valid parameters for regional cultural expression were often foils for broader political debates. Queensland Spaniards&#8217; self-perception, and their negotiation of multiple identities, continued to reference the spaces and imagery of Spain. Yet, these identities were subjective, and the move to Queensland altered their purpose and modes of expression. Queensland Spaniards sought to recreate comparable social networks to those that had sustained their identities prior to emigration, frequently contacting comparable Australian groups that shared similar means of expression. Spaniards did not set old identities aside, but new issues in Spain and Queensland forced a process of clarification and the compartmentalisation of roles. Sharp divisions in Spanish communities&#8217; social memories were accentuated by the regional nature of Queensland settlement, focussing cultural debates on regional norms. The regional nature of Queensland&#8217;s Spanish settlement altered the expression of cultural and political identities, but also left them relatively uncontested until the influx of Castilian migrants in the late 1950s. Most Spanish migrants to Australia preferred the southern states of Victoria and New South Wales, where greater stability fostered larger and more cohesively &#8216;Spanish&#8217; communities. Queensland&#8217;s long distances and radical political atmosphere instead facilitated the replication of Spain&#8217;s regional characteristics. Industrial tensions aided radicals who were able to find comparable political identities, whilst family networks that referred to spaces in Spain developed sophisticated strategies to accelerate chain migration. The thesis corrects a serious lack of research into Spanish migrants in Australia. The group&#8217;s small size has led researchers to favour larger communities, despite the important information offered by the Spanish example. The thesis provides a historical narrative of Spaniards&#8217; experiences in Queensland, but also applies academic debates regarding social memories, and investigates their relationship to cultural and political identities. This includes not only the maintenance of social memories, but also their replication and modification over several generations. The analysis uses awareness of political change in both Queensland and Spain, to investigate migrants&#8217; long-term response to political trauma and changed social circumstance.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430000 History and Archaeology</field><field name="subject">Ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Hispanic Studies</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Migration</field><field name="subject">Politics</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">Spain</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:162229</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effective and Efficient Similarity Search in Video Databases</field><field name="creator">Jie Shao</field><field name="description">Searching relevant information based on content features in video databases is an interesting and challenging research topic that has drawn lots of attention recently. Video similarity search has many practical applications such as TV broadcast monitoring, copyright compliance enforcement and search result clustering, etc. However, existing studies are limited to provide fast and accurate solutions due to the diverse variations among the videos in large collections. In this thesis, we introduce the database support for effective and efficient video similarity search from various sources, even if there exists some transformation distortion, partial content re-ordering, insertion, deletion or replacement. Specifically, we focus on processing two different types of content-based queries: video clip retrieval in a large collection of segmented short videos, and video subsequence identification from a long unsegmented stream. The first part of the thesis investigates the problem of how to process a number of individual kNN searches on the same database simultaneously to reduce the computational overhead of current content-based video search systems. We propose a Dynamic Query Ordering (DQO) algorithm for efficiently processing Batch Nearest Neighbor (BNN) search in high-dimensional space, with advanced optimizations of both I/O cost and CPU cost. The second part of the thesis challenges an unstudied problem of temporal localization of similar content from a long unsegmented video sequence, with extension to identify the occurrence of potentially different ordering or length with respect to query due to video content editing. A graph transformation and matching approach supported by the above BNN search is proposed, as a filter-and-refine query processing strategy to effectively but still efficiently identify the most similar subsequence. The third part of the thesis extends the method of Bounded Coordinate System (BCS) we introduced earlier for video clip retrieval. A novel collective perspective of exploiting the distributional discrepancy of samples for assessing the similarity between two video clips is presented. Several ideas of non-parametric hypothesis tests in statistics are utilized to check the hypothesis whether two ensembles of points are from a same distribution. The proposed similarity measures can provide a more comprehensive analysis that captures the essence of invariant distribution information for retrieving video clips. For each part, we demonstrate comprehensive experimental evaluations, which show improved performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. In the end, some scheduled extensions of this work are highlighted as future research objectives.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multimedia Databases</field><field name="subject">Content-based Video Search</field><field name="subject">Indexing Methods</field><field name="subject">Query Processing</field><field name="subject">Similarity Measures</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:162348</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Criminal Nation: The Crime Fiction of Mary Helena Fortune</field><field name="creator">Miss Nicola Bowes</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the crime fiction of Mary Helena Fortune (c.18331910). My analysis concentrates on Fortune&#8217;s series, &#8220;The Detective&#8217;s Album&#8221;, more than four hundred self-contained crime stories published over forty years that are framed as the &#8220;casebook&#8221; of a colonial detective, Mark Sinclair. Although this series remains nominally the reminiscences of Sinclair, the stories within the casebook increasingly employ private and amateur detectives, and Sinclair himself transforms from a member of the colonial police force into a private inquiry agent. I characterise this move as constituting a shift from Fortune&#8217;s detecting heroes acting essentially as &#8220;public avengers&#8221; to becoming instead predominantly &#8220;private defenders&#8221;. Accompanying the evolution of the detective are other structural changes in Fortune&#8217;s crime fiction, so that by the 1880s an increasingly private model of detective was more often resolving a domestic mystery in a suburban setting than investigating a violent crime on the mean streets. The central aim of this thesis is to demonstrate the ways in which these transformations relate to the differentiated social and historical conditions within colonial Australia. Through the close analysis of Fortune&#8217;s crime texts and examination of the cultural and historical context in which they were produced, the thesis offers perspectives on broad cultural patterns. This thesis draws predominantly on a lineage of critics who have analysed crime fiction using Marxist, Foucauldian and Postcolonialist strategies. I utilise in particular the central paradigm of D. A. Miller&#8217;s The Novel and the Police (1988): &#8211; his assertion that in the nineteenth-century novel the &#8220;move to discard the role of the detective is at the same time a move to disperse the function of detection&#8221;. The appearance of private and amateur detectives in Fortune&#8217;s crime fiction indicates respectively the professionalisation and privatisation of the mechanism of detection, evolutions that reflect a broad embourgeoisment within her crime corpus. Such a social transformation of nineteenth-century crime fiction occurred across the industrialised world. In British crime fiction, for instance, the ordinary workaday policeman of the 1850s had given way by the 1890s to such independent and professional detectives as Sherlock Holmes. But while the embourgeoisment of crime fiction was an international phenomenon, I argue that in Australian crime fiction the emergence of private and surrogate detectives also performed a second, crucial function: to distance the agent of detection, and demotic crime fiction itself, from the enforcement of imperial order in the colonial landscape. The movement from simple criminal apprehensions to financial and reputation protection also increasingly distances Fortune&#8217;s crime fiction from the kind of direct social control necessary to enforce imperial order. v This thesis contains four analytical chapters, each of which is devoted to exploring mechanisms by which Fortune&#8217;s crime fiction dispersed the function of detection and concealed the conservative disciplinary order that underpins the fiction. The first three chapters examine familiar forms of fictional detectives: the official police detective; the private and the amateur detective; and the female detective, both official and unofficial. The final analytical chapter examines the way in which the criminal also worked as part of the dispersed function of detection. One of the key ways in which Fortune&#8217;s crime fiction works to reinforce disciplinary order is, paradoxically, to make the detectives often fail to solve the crime, so that order is restored only by the collective efforts of several individuals or through the mechanism of fate or an avenging land, or even as a consequence of the criminals&#8217; own actions. Thus Fortune&#8217;s crime fiction is not a celebration of virtuoso individualism, as is found in the stories of Sherlock Holmes, but instead of an ethically logical and just world in which order is the product of collective efforts on the part of a largely cohesive community, and in which the apprehension of criminals and restoration of order are presented as inevitable outcomes. Stephen Knight has described Fortune as &#8220;internationally the most significant woman writing about crime in the mid-nineteenth century&#8221; (Continent of Mystery 4), and yet her impressive corpus of crime fiction has never received extended scholarly attention. This thesis addresses this omission, but more importantly, the conclusions I offer about Mary Fortune&#8217;s crime fiction contribute to an understanding of a much larger question about how Australians began to imagine and adopt a national identity in the nineteenth century. It is certainly clear from Fortune&#8217;s crime corpus that well before the nationalist-democratic cultural insurrection of the 1890s, Australian fiction already offered versions of the key paradigms that still inflect the national imagination into the twenty-first century.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">420000 Language and Culture</field><field name="subject">mary fortune,</field><field name="subject">crime fiction,</field><field name="subject">australian literature</field><field name="subject">imperialism</field><field name="subject">nationalism</field><field name="subject">detective fiction</field><field name="subject">female detective</field><field name="subject">Police</field><field name="subject">bushranger</field><field name="subject">postcolonialism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:162386</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Living within protected areas in Vietnam: situations, issues and strategies</field><field name="creator">Thuy Thi Phan</field><field name="description">Many of the world&#8217;s protected areas (PAs) are inhabited, and this is a challenge for governments, organizations and individuals who need to reconcile the demands of both conservation and development. Resettlement has been seen as one strategy to achieve this. However, the situation is complicated by the fact that in countries such as Vietnam little information on biodiversity conservation has been documented and information both on the resettled people and the condition of PAs after resettlement &#8211; are either scanty or completely absent. This study focused on the perspectives of people living within PAs in Vietnam, and examined their socio-economic situations, the development and conservation issues they confront, and the strategies that are employed by various levels of government and other agencies to deal with their presence within PAs. This was done using Pu Mat National Park (PMNP) as the main case study in order to address three questions: (1) What were the conservation and development issues people within PMNP faced? (2) Why was resettlement chosen and how was it implemented? and (3) What were the impacts of the resettlement program in ensuring both conservation and development outcomes. Another five supplementary case studies: Cuc Phuong National Park, Ba Be National Park, Xuan Son National Park, Cat Tien National Park and Pu Huong Nature Reserve were selected as comparisons with PMNP. The case studies were examined using a variety of qualitative and quantitative data derived from documentary sources, key informants, semi-structured interviews, group discussions and participant observation. PMNP has extremely high biodiversity and is of nternational conservation significance. It was officially confirmed as a PA, the highest classification for biodiversity conservation in Vietnam. An ethnic minority group, the Dan Lai, live in three villages located on the upper streams of the Khe Khang Valley 15-45 km within the Park&#8217;s Core Zone in one of the most important conservation areas of PMNP. The Dan Lai, however, have been doubly disadvantaged because their location remains undeveloped and their lives are restricted by conservation regulations. As a result, since 1997 when Pu Mat Nature Reserve was established, their living standards have deteriorated. Resettlement projects have had mixed effects on the livelihoods of the Dan Lai in both the short- and long-terms, with negative impacts outweighing the positive. In both cases, the resettled people received more advantages in terms of regional development and support from other projects. However, the land at the new site was of poor quality, and the Dan Lai, who are not used to an intensive farming system, suffered agricultural failures. Resettlement also failed in mitigating the marginalization of the affected people in the program&#8217;s early stages. In terms of conservation outcomes, however, the resettlement projects impacted positively in both the short- and long-terms. The local people in resettled villages now have better knowledge about conservation and their attitudes toward conservation are more positive. In the new sites they are also less involved in forest exploitation. It appears that the Dan Lai have not been the main cause of recent biodiversity loss in the Park as they have mainly exploited forest products for their subsistence needs. Rather, people from outside, some of them professional hunters, fishermen and loggers, have more seriously impacted on conservation. However, with increasing exposure to people from outside and accelerating forest exploitation and economic development, the Dan Lai&#8217;s influence on the Park is now beginning to pose a greater danger to conservation. Taking all these factors in account, this study concluded that resettlement into more developed areas would now be the most appropriate action for the Dan Lai remaining in the Park. With the five supplementary case studies, overall it was found that, on the one hand, the residents of PAs have very low living standards. On the other, it cannot be denied that these people pose significant threats to conservation as populations rapidly increase and lifestyles are gradually shifting to embrace a market orientated economy. Several strategies have been employed in the five supplementary case studies but most of these have not been effective or enduring. All five PAs, except Pu Huong Nature Reserve, have pursued a resettlement approach. When resettlement has been undertaken only a part of the population has been relocated with more people needing to be moved in the future. Other collaborative management approaches have been only party employed in two cases. Because of the diversity and complexity of different situations in various PAs in Vietnam, it is not possible to prescribe a single strategy or framework for people living within them. However, in the six cases examined in this study, the strategies selected have not achieved the expected outcomes. This indicates that finding an effective framework for this issue that is practical in the Vietnamese context is an urgent task. Experience from resettlements both within Vietnam and globally demonstrates that in order to achieve both development and conservation objectives, appropriate resources and a well developed plan are required for successful resettlement.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:162396</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Amino Acid Digestibility and Requirements of Broiler Chickens</field><field name="creator">Mulyantini Ni Gusti Ayu</field><field name="description">The dietary requirement for protein is actually a requirement for the amino acids contained in the dietary protein. The efficiency of protein utilization depends to a large extent on the amino acid composition of the diet. Although a large volume of published amino acid digestibility values for poultry feedstuffs is available, there are still many gaps in our knowledge on digestibility and utilization of amino acids. The major focus of this thesis was to examine several aspects of amino acid digestibility and utilization in broiler chickens. Initial studies examined the performance of two commercial broiler strains fed diets formulated on total or digestible amino acids. The objective of this study was to determine the individual bird response to 4 different diets formulated on: 1) total amino acids; 2) digestible amino acids (book values)using the same ingredient as diet 1; 3) digestible amino acids values determined on the same ingredients as used in diet 1: and 4) digestible amino acids but formulated commercially. The results show that birds given diets formulated on digestible amino acid basis, grew faster, ate more feed and converted it into body weight more efficiently, and had a higher proportion of body protein (P&lt;0.05) than birds given diet formulated on a total amino acid basis. It was also shown that males broiler were significantly faster growing, consumed more feed and had better feed efficiency than do female broilers. There was also a significant (P&lt;0.05)sex x diet interaction for weight gain. Whilst, males always grew faster than females, the difference was much greater for those given the digestible amino acid formulated diets. The studies reported in Chapters 5 and 6 was conducted to determine the digestible methionine, lysine and threonine requirement of broilers during the starter and finisher periods. The minimum digestible methionine requirements to maximize weight gain for starter was similar with grower. Digestible lysine requirements to maximize weight gain represent a decrease 25%, respectively from starter to grower. The lysine digestible requirement for weight gain decreased from 11.4 g/kg diet (0 to 3 wk) to 8.5 g/kg diet (3 to 6 wk). For threonine, the starter threonine level of 6.5 g/kg resulted in the best responses (P&lt;0.01). The study reported in Chapter 7 was to identify the extent of differences in the nutritional value of sorghum available within Australia, in particular the apparent digestibility of amino acids in sorghum samples based upon digesta samples taken from the lower ileum of the chicken. The results of this study suggest that it is possible to estimate digestible amino acid supply from sorghum from the protein content of the grain. Crude protein content (N x 6.25) of sorghum varied from 80.2 to 117.5 g/kg dry matter. In most Australian cereal based diet lysine is first limiting amino acids. In this experimental diet, methionine is the first limiting amino acid content ranged from 1.06 to 1.42%. It followed by lysine, histidine and glycine, respectively. The cereal-based diets fed to poultry contain substantial quantities of phytin,which is poorly digested by poultry. The poor digestive utilization of phytin-bound P by poultry and its consequences on digestibility of protein and amino acids lead to do some more extensive research in this aspect. In this regard, the effects of enzyme supplementation on apparent ileal amino acid digestibility of cereal were studied in Chapter 8. Supplementing wheat fed to 5-wk-old broilers with xylanase alone or a combination of xylanase and phytase improved the ileal digestibility of amino acids. Although there was improvement in sorghum based diet, phytase and xylanase supplementation had no effect on the avaergae of ileal amino acid digestibility. Overall, the results presented in this thesis demonstrate that formulation of poultry diets on a digestible amino acid basis is superior to formulation of diets on a total amino acid basis. This study suggested that genotype and sex differences in performance and body composition should be taken into account when formulating diets to maximize performance of broiler chickens. Moreover, the requirement of digestible lysine, methionine and threonine for broiler chicken during the starter and finisher periods were obtained in this study.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:162399</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of exercise training, and combined exercise and cognitive training, on cognitive and physical function in older adults: A randomised controlled trial and qualitative evaluation</field><field name="creator">Miss Siobhan O'Dwyer</field><field name="description">Background Some degree of cognitive decline is a normal, non-clinical part of aging. Physical exercise has been suggested as one strategy which may improve cognition in nondemented older adults. The findings of randomised, controlled trials conducted since the 1980s have been promising, but not unequivocal, and much remains to be understood about the relationship between exercise and cognition in older adults. There have also been suggestions that combining exercise and cognitive training may be beneficial. There has, however, been only one reported study comparing the benefits of exercise training, and combined exercise and cognitive training (Fabre, Chamari, Mucci, Masse-Biron, &amp; Prefaut, 2002). While combined training was reported to be even more effective than exercise training alone for improving cognition in older adults, the study had some substantial limitations. Aims The overall aims of this thesis were to further explore the effect of exercise training on cognition in older adults, and to compare exercise training alone with combined exercise and cognitive training. Following a narrative review of the relevant literature, this thesis is presented in two parts. In Part One a randomized, controlled trial comparing the impact of exercise training, and combined exercise and cognitive training, on the cognitive functioning, physical functioning, functional performance, and psychological well-being of communitydwelling older adults is presented. For Part One, there were three specific aims: (1) To assess the efficacy of a 16 week exercise program (relative to control), on measures of cognitive functioning, physical functioning, functional performance, and psychological well-being; (2) To compare the efficacy of the 16 week exercise program with that of a 16 week combined exercise and cognitive training program; and (3) To identify the physical, psychological and training factors associated with changes in cognitive and physical functioning from baseline to post-test. In Part Two a qualitative evaluation of older adults&#8217; experiences and perceptions of exercise training, and combined exercise and cognitive training, is presented. Methods Thirty-nine community dwelling, older adults (aged between 60 and 80 years) were randomly allocated to one of three groups: Exercise, Combination or Control. Participants in the Exercise group attended three aerobic and strength training sessions per week for 16 weeks. Participants in the Combination group attended two aerobic and strength training sessions, and one cognitive training session, per week for 16 weeks. Participants in the Control group were contacted every four weeks. Assessments were conducted at baseline, post-test (16 weeks) and six-month follow-up (40 weeks). Measures of physical function, cognitive function, functional performance, and psychological wellbeing were collected, along with anthropometric and physiological measures. For the qualitative evaluation, participants from the Exercise and Combination groups provided written feedback to questions about their experiences of the two training programs and their perceptions of the outcomes. These qualitative data were collected after post-test. Results Significant within-group improvements in physical and cognitive function, from baseline to post-test, were seen in Exercise and Combination participants. Combination participants also showed significant within-group reductions in symptoms of anxiety and depression. There were, however, only a few significant between-group differences among Exercise and Control participants, and among Exercise and Combination participants. There were no significant within-group improvements in functional performance, from baseline to post-test, among Exercise or Combination participants. Six-month follow-up data were difficult to interpret, due to the paucity of between-group differences at post-test and the small sample size. There were several significant associations between physical, psychological and training factors, and changes in cognitive and physical functioning. The most pertinent finding was that baseline functioning was consistently associated with change, such that participants with low baseline scores were most likely to improve from baseline to posttest. In the qualitative evaluation participants reported positive experiences of the training programs and reported improvements in physical, cognitive, functional and psychological wellbeing. Participants also highlighted components of the programs which require improvement and made recommendations for future programs. Conclusions The results of this thesis provide some cautious support for the notion that exercise, and combined exercise and cognitive training, may result in small improvements in cognition, physical functioning, and psychological well-being in older adults. Some of the findings must be interpreted with caution, however, given the small sample size. More research is required into the functional (or &#8216;real world&#8217;) impact of this type of training, the long-term effects of training, and the factors associated with changes in cognitive and physical function. Based on these findings, recommendations for the development and implementation of future research were made. As the population ages and the public health burden attributable to aging increases, research into the development and efficacy of programs to enhance well-being and independence in older adults is of great importance.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">exercise, cognition, older adults, cognitive training, qualitative, randomised controlled trial</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:162406</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Origins of Left Behind Eschatology</field><field name="creator">Mr David Bennett</field><field name="description">"The Origins of Left Behind Eschatology&#8221; examines the origins of the beliefs that undergird the popular Left Behind novels by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins. How that system of belief arose has long been hotly debated. Using mainly non-fiction books and articles by authors with Left Behind views, I first seek to determine what those beliefs are. From that I draw out eight specific beliefs that are essential to Left Behind eschatology. I next conduct an examination of eschatology in certain eras of Church history, looking for the origins of each of these eight test criteria and seeking when they all first came together to form a system. I examine the early Church thoroughly, but briefly, noting that five of the test criteria were present in the first three hundred years of Christian history. However, no individual taught more than four of them. In addition, the four scholars in this period who each taught four of these beliefs also taught doctrines contrary to Left Behind. I then look at the period from the Reformation, with particular emphasis on the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries. While teachings similar to two of the three remaining Left Behind concepts are found in the seventeenth century those two ideas do not properly emerge until the eighteenth century in a work by Morgan Edwards, a Welsh/American Baptist. The final criterion does not appear until the late 1820s in the thought of J.N. Darby of the Plymouth Brethren. Darby was also the first to draw all eight elements together in the early 1830s. I close with a look at how these beliefs became widely accepted and adapted in the remainder of the nineteenth century and in the twentieth.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Left Behind</field><field name="subject">eschatology</field><field name="subject">Origins</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:162422</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and guanine metabolism in adipogenesis</field><field name="creator">Ms Hua Su</field><field name="description">The obesity epidemic is associated with an increase in the prevalence of a number of chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension and some cancers and has been described by the World Health Organisation as one of the greatest public health challenges of the 21st century. Obesity is characterised by excessive expansion of adipose tissue mass underpinned by adipocyte hyperplasia. Central to this is the process of adipogenesis, which encompasses the proliferation and terminal differentiation of fibroblastic preadipocytes, contained within adipose tissue, to mature adipocytes. Despite the pivotal role of this process in obesity our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms governing adipocyte development, either in physiological or pathophysiological settings, is limited. Studies aimed at understanding this complex process are integral to development of more effective strategies for the prevention and/or treatment of obesity and obesity related diseases. Our laboratory recently identified a putative role for inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), a rate-limiting enzyme in de novo guanine nucleotide biosynthesis, in the dynamic regulation of lipid accumulation. Upon treatment of a variety of cell types with insulin or oleic acid IMPDH translocates to lipid droplets and inhibition of this translocation is correlated with reduced lipid accumulation. As lipid droplet formation and lipid accretion are defining features of adipogenesis, it was hypothesised that IMPDH may facilitate efficient lipid accumulation during adipose conversion of preadipocytes. In vitro systems have been used extensively to dissect the molecular and cellular events involved in adipogenesis. Therefore the aim of this project was to extend these investigations to examine the requirement for IMPDH activity during adipogenesis, using the well characterised murine 3T3-L1 cell line and primary human preadipocytes (phPAs). IMPDH expression and activity were transiently increased during differentiation of the 3T3-L1 cells although IMPDH did not associate with lipid droplets under these conditions. Pharmacological inhibition of IMPDH, using mycophenolic acid (MPA; 1 &#181;M), reduced intracellular GTP by 60%, and blocked mitotic clonal expansion (MCE) and adipogenesis. Supplementation with guanosine (60 &#181;M), a substrate in the nucleotide salvage pathway, restored both GTP levels and adipogenesis. These observations indicated that IMPDH activity is required for efficient differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Preliminary studies, involving differentiation of phPAs in standard serum-free medium (SFM) suggested that phPAs were resistant to MPA. To afford better comparison between the phPAs and the 3T3-L1 cells, which are differentiated in serum-containing medium (SCM), a modified 3T3-L1 like protocol facilitating efficient differentiation of the phPAs in SCM was established. Under these conditions phPAs displayed considerable variation in sensitivity to MPA which gave a trend towards decreased differentiation (reduced by 26%; p=0.07). Supplementation with guanosine significantly reduced adipogenesis (by 37%; p&lt;0.05) in the phPAs independent of MPA. Furthermore, cells that were MPA resistant were also refractory to guanosine suggesting greater plasticity of guanine metabolism in phPAs from those subjects. A major difference between the cell types was that phPAs differentiated with high efficiency in the absence of MCE. Collectively, these data indicate that MCE is required for efficient differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells but not phPAs, even when differentiated under similar conditions, and suggest that the involvement of MCE underpins the differences in sensitivity to MPA between cell types. The differential effects of guanosine suggest there are additional differences with respect to the effects of manipulation of guanine nucleotides between cell types. In summary, the work presented in this thesis demonstrated inhibition of IMPDH blocked adipogenesis of murine 3T3-L1 cells and reduced differentiation of phPAs in some subjects.

Given the enormity of environmental issues, the funding available to managers is insufficient. Managers must make decisions about how to act within the bounds of this limited funding. Conservation decision-making is also limited by a lack of knowledge about the systems we are trying to conserve. Much of the information required for effective conservation is uncertain. In this thesis I focus on practical ways of approaching the immense predicament of how to make good conservation decisions in the face of these two limitations. In chapter two I provide both an optimal framework and analytic rule of thumb for allocating limited funding among subpopulations of a threatened species. My results show that the number of subpopulations we can effectively manage is driven by the economic constraints placed on management and the risk of extinction of the species we are trying to protect. We discover that it is rarely optimal to manage all the remaining isolated subpopulations of a threatened species. This highlights the importance of a triage approach to the management of subpopulations of a threatened species under the current climate of limited funding, leading us to coin the term &#8216;subpopulation triage&#8217;. One key area of uncertainty that links directly with how we allocate resources for conservation is uncertainty in the impact of our management actions on the systems we are trying to protect (the impact-investment curve). This relationship often drives the outcomes of our decision-making frameworks. In chapter three I investigate how uncertainty in the impact-investment curve, assumed in chapter two, alters our optimal management decision. Again, I find that limited conservation finances are a major limiting factor in the robustness of a strategy to our incomplete understanding. I discover that &#8216;subpopulation triage&#8217; can be a natural consequence of robust decision-making. Uncertainty is not, however, always beyond our control. We can reduce it by diverting funding from management to collect data on our systems. This entails monitoring costs that must also be considered when making optimal conservation decisions. There are a number of reasons why we could monitor; to reduce our uncertainty in the status of threatened species where management is driven by species status; to aid learning about a component of the system we are managing; for both initial surveillance and adaptive approaches; and to report on the performances of conservation action to stakeholders. In chapter four I assess the benefit of initial surveillance to gain information on biodiversity value before we acquire a land parcel for the reserve network. The risk here is that the land parcel may be removed from the market during surveying. I describe both an optimal method, using stochastic dynamic programming (SDP), and a simple rule of thumb, for how to make such decisions. The solutions to this problem illustrate how optimal conservation is necessarily dynamic and that immediate implementation of a conservation plan may not always yield the best conservation outcome. Learning does not always need to take place in the absence of management. In chapter five I investigate adaptive learning for a threatened species where we must discriminate between multiple hypotheses of how the system works by implementing different management actions. We find that the optimal action depends on our belief in each model being the true model of our system, the benefit from each action under each model, and the number of sites available to implement an active adaptive strategy. In chapter six I investigate when one should learn about the state of the system through monitoring when management is state-dependent. Here our management of subpopulations of a threatened species is based on whether these subpopulations persist. I ask when should we survey or manage a subpopulation, and when, if ever, should we do nothing in a subpopulation of a threatened species. I find that management actions should not only be driven by the return on investment gained by managing a subpopulation but also by our certainty of the persistence of a subpopulation. This is the first work to show a direct trade-off between return on investment from conservation action and reduced uncertainty. One key evaluation method currently adopted worldwide is the use of &#8216;State of the Environment&#8217; reporting. In chapter seven I assess the flaws of &#8216;State of the Environment&#8217; reporting, the current method adopted worldwide for evaluating conservation policy. I show the positive biases inherent in such reporting and provide a new metric for reporting on conservation performance that is simple, transparent and provides an unbiased report on performance in reaching conservation objectives. I show that without honest reporting of conservation gains &#8211; and losses &#8211; we limit our ability to assess where we are in terms of conservation progress. Overall my thesis shows the need for managers to consider a triage approach to threatened species management, not as a process of giving up, but as a tool for ensuring species persistence in light of the urgency of most conservation requirements and the realities of financial and knowledge limitations. Indeed if conservation is a field dedicated to the protection of biodiversity then those responsible for decision-making&#8211;&#8211;politicians, scientists and environmental managers&#8211;&#8211;must use whatever approach gives the best outcome for the environment. Under current limitations, triage is often a necessity not an option.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">threatened species management</field><field name="subject">conservation planning</field><field name="subject">optimal monitoring</field><field name="subject">Adaptive Management</field><field name="subject">reporting</field><field name="subject">conservation performance</field><field name="subject">uncertainty</field><field name="subject">decision-making</field><field name="subject">triage</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:162488</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Minimising Environmental and Public Health Risk of Pesticide Application Through Understanding the Droplet-Canopy Interface</field><field name="creator">Mr Gary Dorr</field><field name="description">Accurate placement of pesticide droplets on to crop and weed surfaces is a key step in controlling pests and weeds in agricultural production systems. Droplets impact on plant surfaces, depositing pesticides that give protective coverage on crops and destructive coverage for insect or fungi pests and weeds. Coverage is complex and is determined by a multitude of interactions between factors such as size and density of spray droplets, relative humidity and turbulence of the air through which the droplets travel, and the physical characteristics of the target plant leaves, branches and stems that go to make up the architecture of their canopy. There are, however, concerns over the effect of pesticides on the environment and public health. This thesis combines three dimensional (3-D) computer modelling techniques, physical measurements of droplet movement and impact on a canopy in a wind tunnel and risk management techniques to maximise the effectiveness of pesticides and enable risks to public health and the environment from agricultural spraying activities to be minimised. L-studio, a Windows based software environment for creating simulation models of plant architecture was used in this study. A particle trajectory model, based on the combined ballistic and random-walk approach proposed by Mokeba et al. (1997) and Cox et al. (2000) was used to model spray droplet movement. Algorithms were included in the spray model to account for evaporation of droplets, entrained air and movement of air around the spray, collection efficiency, and droplet splash. Existing functional-structural plant models of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) and sow thistle (Sonchus oleraceus L.) and a static empirical model of immature grass weeds have been combined with the spray model. An environmental program has been used to take the location of the leaves in 3-D space from the plant model and determine if spray droplets will impact on them. Wind tunnel measurements were made to determine initial droplet properties (droplet size, velocity, trajectory, density and fluid properties) and droplet impact characteristics (retention and splash). The results from these measurements were then used to define parameters within the spray model. Additional experiments to measure spray drift and spray deposition on various plant surfaces within the wind tunnel were used to evaluate the combined spray and plant architecture model. The combined spray and plant architectural model developed and evaluated in this thesis has provided a new method to study the influence of plant architecture on spray distribution. This work has shown that 3-D plant architecture can influence the amount of spray depositing on leaf surfaces. Deposition on plant surfaces was also found to increase with decreased wind speed and reduced release height. Droplet size did not have a significant influence on spray deposition onto broadleaf plants such as cotton or sow thistle. There was however, a tendency for fine sprays to give a higher deposit on small, narrow grass leaves. Spray drift was found to increase with decreasing droplet size, increasing the range of droplet sizes generated by a nozzle, decreasing sheet velocity (initial velocity of droplets), increasing wind speed, increasing (difference between dry and wet bulb temperature), decreasing liquid density and increasing release height. The combined spray and architectural model has also enabled the study of how effects such as droplet splash and retention can influence the distribution of the spray. In this study it was found that there was little difference in modelled spray drift, amount of spray on the ground or amount of spray on the cotton plant between situations where most droplets splash on impact and where no droplet splash on impact. Although the total amount of spray retained on the plant surface was similar for both situations, it was found that there were more droplets on the plant under the splash scenario leading to better coverage of the spray over the plant. These results indicate that the majority of the smaller splash droplets were re-distributed onto other parts of the plant rather than becoming lost as spray drift or ground deposit. Decision trees have been used in this thesis to characterise the benefits and risks from pesticide applications. Results from model simulations and/or physical measurements are used to estimate the relative proportion of the spray depositing on plant surfaces, depositing on the ground and drifting away from the treatment area. These deposition results give a measure of pesticide exposure that can be incorporated into the risk management framework to investigate the influence of various application scenarios. The applicability of this approach is shown by the example of endosulfan sprayed on cotton to control Helicoverpa spp. The decision tree model can be used to quickly compare different scenarios, such as deciding which application method should be used. It can be used to effectively aid spray decisions to maximise the effectiveness of pesticides and minimise risks to public health and the environment from agricultural spraying activities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pesticide, pesticide application, spray, herbicide, model, l-system, risk management</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:162565</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Steroid hormones, steroid binding proteins and persistent environmental pollutants in green (Chelonia mydas) and flatback (Natator depressus) turtles</field><field name="creator">Maria Ikonomopoulou</field><field name="description">Sea Turtles are long-lived marine reptiles that have existed for more than 150,000 years. All seven turtle species extant today are characterised as endangered by the World Conservation Union Red List of Threatened Species. This PhD thesis investigates aspects of endocrinology and toxicology in green (Chelonia mydas) (Peninsular Malaysia) and flatback (Natator depressus) (Curtis Island, Queensland, Australia) turtles. This thesis aimed to identify if toxicants have an affect on reproduction and development in marine turtles. A high affinity steroid binding protein showing an affinity for testosterone and oestradiol was identified and described in nesting C. mydas and the thermal profile of sex steroid binding proteins in C. mydas was studied. This is the first study that has investigated sex steroid binding proteins in marine turtles. A sex steroid binding protein was also observed in male and female hatchling C. mydas and the effect of temperature on sex steroid binding proteins was investigated. This new, minor-invasive method of sex identification shows that different sex steroid binding proteins could reflect different hormonal patterns in female and male hatchling C. mydas. The steroid and metabolites profiles in nesting C. mydas (Peninsular Malaysia) and N. depressus (Curtis Island, Queensland) were established. Progesterone levels were the highest followed by testosterone, oestrone and dihydrotestosterone levels. The significant role of oestrone in nesting sea turtles was verified. The elevated concentrations of corticosterone, thyroxine, glucose and triglyceride indicated high metabolic demands placed upon C. mydas and N. depressus during nesting activities. The metabolite profiles and hormone concentrations were investigated to determine whether there was any relationship between hormonal changes during nesting activities in C. mydas and N. depressus. A methodology to measure heavy metal concentrations in the blood and eggs of N. depressus was developed. Moreover, this was the first time that tin compound derivatives have been identified in marine turtles in Australia. A complex heavy metal profile was identified in eggs. It is suggested that eggs may be an important, practical and reliable indicator of environmental contamination in nesting marine turtles. Pesticides were measured in the blood and eggs of N. depressus. Organochlorine and polychlorinated biphenyl concentrations were measured in the blood in N. depressus. Traces of OCs and PCBs were detected in eggs of N. depressus. Furthermore, the effects of heavy metals in developing C. mydas of both sexes are presented. During development, it was investigated whether heavy metal concentrations were affected by age, gender or the different clutch in C. mydas. The effect of a variety of toxicants (i.e. pesticides and heavy metals) on the sex steroid binding protein properties was investigated in nesting C. mydas. This important study identifies mechanisms by which toxicants may exert a physiological effect upon sex steroids (i.e. testosterone and oestradiol) in nesting turtles. The toxicants were studied at a wide range of concentrations. Some toxicants were shown to weaken or abolish the association of the testosterone and/or oestradiol binding proteins in nesting C. mydas. Correlations were observed between heavy metal concentrations found in blood and eggs and steroid and metabolite levels in nesting N. depressus. Zinc which was previously measured in the blood was positively correlated with testosterone concentrations in nesting N. depressus. Chromium which was found in eggs was negatively correlated corticosterone concentrations. Manganese was the only heavy metal (measured in eggs) which was negatively correlated with progesterone and positively correlated with triglyceride concentrations in nesting N. depressus. Finally, a quantified histological method was developed to determine the sex in C. mydas hatchlings by investigating specific histological criteria. A number of &#8220;undetermined sex&#8221; hatchlings were verified and it is hypothesised that abnormal reproductive development is related to the presence of environmental contaminants previously found in the studied C. mydas population of Peninsular Malaysia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Flatback sea turtles</field><field name="subject">Green sea turtles</field><field name="subject">Sex steroid hormones</field><field name="subject">Sex steroid binding proteins</field><field name="subject">Environmental toxicants</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:162620</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular mechanism of MC1R association with skin cancer risk phenotypes</field><field name="creator">Ms Kimberley Beaumont</field><field name="description">The melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) expressed on the surface of the melanocyte. MC1R activation after UV exposure results in the production of the dark eumelanin pigment and the tanning process in humans, providing protection from UV induced DNA damage. MC1R activation has also recently been linked to DNA repair. The MC1R gene is highly polymorphic in Caucasian populations with a number of MC1R variant alleles associated with red hair, fair skin, poor tanning and increased risk of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. These MC1R variant receptors were thought to be loss of function, however the type of defect and the extent of the loss of function for individual variants was relatively unknown before the commencement of this PhD project. Many GPCR mutant proteins are intracellularly retained, resulting in a loss of signalling ability. To determine if this was the case for MC1R variant receptors, the localisation of the wild type and variant MC1R protein was investigated using immunofluorescence and radio-ligand binding on transfected melanocytic cells as well as primary melanocyte strains. For the first time, several MC1R variants including V60L, R151C, I155T, R160W and R163Q, were shown to have reduced cell surface expression compared to wild type MC1R. cAMP assays were used to determine the signalling ability of activated wild type and variant MC1R, importantly, variant receptors with reduced cell surface expression showed corresponding impairment in cAMP signalling. In contrast, the R142H and D294H variants, which have normal cell surface expression but significantly impaired cAMP signalling, are thought to have a defect in G-protein coupling. Some MC1R variants were found to have dominant negative activity on the wild type receptor in co-expression studies, this result may explain the MC1R heterozygote effect on human pigmentation phenotypes. This dominant negative effect resulted in either reduced wild type cell surface expression or reduced G-protein coupling and may be mediated by receptor dimerisation. In order to validate the in vitro studies, comparison of variant receptor characteristics with skin and hair colour data of individuals both homozygous and heterozygous for MC1R variant alleles was performed. This revealed parallels between variant MC1R cell surface expression, functional ability, dominant negative activity and the strength of the effects of variant alleles on human pigmentation. From the in vitro functional studies, it was clear that most variant receptors retained some signaling ability, although the relative abilities varied. An important unanswered question in the literature was whether the phenotype of carriers of the high penetrance MC1R variant alleles was actually representative of complete loss of function for MC1R. Due to the rarity of MC1R null alleles they had only previously been found in the heterozygous state, however we described the phenotype of one individual compound heterozygous for two frameshift mutations resulting in an individual unable to produce any functional MC1R protein. Phenotypic analysis indicated that red hair and fair skin is found in the absence of MC1R. Finally, preliminary studies using low temperature, chemical or pharmacological chaperones indicated that the cell surface expression of some MC1R variants could be rescued in cell transfection experiments. This resulted in a restoration of signaling ability after stimulation with agonist. These studies into the localization and function of MC1R variants have contributed to a greater understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying the association of MC1R with skin cancer risk phenotypes, and may lead to future drug based therapies that are able to rescue the function of MC1R variants that are intracellularly retained.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MC1R</field><field name="subject">melanocortin-1 receptor</field><field name="subject">GPCR</field><field name="subject">melanocortin</field><field name="subject">red hair</field><field name="subject">skin cancer</field><field name="subject">melanoma</field><field name="subject">pigmentation</field><field name="subject">tanning</field><field name="subject">melanogenesis</field><field name="subject">RHC phenotype</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:162726</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vietnamese politeness in Vietnamese - Anglo-cultural interactions: A Confucian perspective</field><field name="creator">PHAM Thi Hong Nhung</field><field name="description">As a fundamental concept in communication in general and intercultural communication in particular, politeness has become a central topic in the research literature. The critical review of the relevant literature shows that the existing theories of politeness do not satisfactorily explain politeness behaviour across cultures, especially politeness behaviour of people in Asian Confucian cultures. Influential theories of politeness have so far focused primarily on the linguistic presentation of politeness (i.e., linguistics politeness) and viewed the individual desire to be free from imposition as the main motivation for politeness, whereas other social and interpersonal motivational concerns for politeness behaviour and the cultural values underlying politeness behaviour are marginalised in the current literature. Additionally, existing theories of politeness are more centred on Anglo-cultural language, particularly English and English-speaking cultures. Intercultural contexts where misunderstandings most probably occur as a result of the differences in cultural values are under-represented in the literature on communication and politeness. Given the widely recognized influence of Confucianism on communication in major Asian cultures, the present study aims to explore how well Confucian theory and principles are able to describe and elucidate Vietnamese politeness in Vietnamese &#8211; Anglo-cultural interactions. The goal of the study is to show how an alternative value system can operate in politeness in intercultural communication contexts. It helps bridge the gap in the literature by exploring Vietnamese politeness motivational concerns and their (non)imposition acts in their interactions with Anglo-culturals in intercultural workplace contexts in non-governmental organizations in Vietnam. The results show that the politeness behaviour of Vietnamese working in intercultural contexts is more influenced by their Confucian orientation to interpersonal harmony rather than by their desire to be free from imposition. In addition, the Vietnamese decision to perform an imposition act on their Anglo-cultural colleagues, and about the level of imposition, is significantly influenced by their perception of the potential benefit of their act toward the Anglo-cultural, and by their perception of the social distance between themselves and the Anglo-cultural with whom they are interacting. On the basis of its findings, the present study supports the need for major amendments to the current literature on politeness. It also proposes further implications for more effective communication between Vietnamese and Anglo-culturals in intercultural workplace contexts, and for language teaching.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Politeness, intercultural communication, Vietnamese &#8211; Anglo-cultural interaction, face, imposition, Confucianism, cultural values, intercultural workplace, politeness motivations</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:162795</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Principles for the Reduction of Errors While Operating Bolting Controls</field><field name="creator">Mrs Veronica Krupenia</field><field name="description">Equipment of many different types is operated by multiple control levers located in close proximity to each other. Selecting the wrong control, or moving the correct control in the wrong direction, has the potential to cause serious injury (e.g. Burgess-Limerick &amp; Steiner, 2006). The objectives of this research were to use a virtual reality simulation of a generic equipment control task to examine: (1) the consequences of shape coding on selection error rate and reaction time; (2) the effect of mirror versus place control layout on shape coding and reaction time when the side to which the controls levers were placed changed; and (3) the consequences of different directional control-response relationships in the horizontal and vertical plane on direction errors and reaction time. Three experiments were completed by a total of 168 participants. Participants were presented with two identical virtual octagonal rods that could elevate/lower, slew left/right, extend/retract and change colour red/blue. One of the images was computer controlled and the other was controlled by four control levers, mounted on a stand, which could be altered in orientation and effects. The task for the participants involved replicating the movement of the computer controlled image by manipulating the four levers positioned on their right or left side. Each participant completed ten blocks of 16 trials, with each trial requiring sequential movements of each of the four control levers. Twenty-four participants completed Experiment One, using horizontal controls and a control-response relationship in which moving each of the horizontal control upwards caused the stimulus to elevate, slew right; extend; or change its colour to red, referred to as control-response relationship 1 (CRR1). Each participant was randomly assigned to start with shape or non-shape coded controls, changing to the reversed coding condition after five blocks. Fewer selection errors occurred in shape coded conditions in the first five blocks, although the difference was not statistically significant. Reaction times decreased as a function of block, and were higher in shape coded trials. There were very few elevation directional errors. Slew and extension directional errors were less likely when there was a spatial correspondence between the movement of the control and the response. Horizontal controls, and the same set of control-response relationships was used in Experiment Two. Each of the 48 participants was randomly assigned to start the experiment with the controls located on their left or right side, whether to complete the experiment with shape or non-shape coded controls, and finally whether to transfer sides to a mirror or place arrangement after five blocks. An effect of coding on selection errors occurred only in the block immediately following a change of sides. However, the effect of coding on selection errors was only seen among participants transferring to a place arrangement, and there were no differences in the number of selection errors between transfer conditions for either coding conditions, nor were there any differences in reaction times between transfer conditions. Reaction times decreased as a function of block, and longer reaction times were measured in the shape coded trials. An advantage of a mirror arrangement when changing sides was suggested when controls were not shape coded, however no advantage was evident when the controls were shape coded. Ninety-six participants completed Experiment Three. Controls were horizontal or vertical, and data were collected for two directional control-response relationship conditions in each orientation: horizontal CRR1; horizontal CRR2 "up" = lower, slew left, retract and blue; vertical CRR1 "away from operator" = elevate, slew right, extend and red; and vertical CRR2 "away from operator" = lower, slew left, retract and blue. Each participant was randomly assigned to complete the experiment with the controls horizontal or vertical, using shape or non-shape coded controls, in the CRR1 or CRR2 condition. The effect of shape coding on reducing the rate of control selection errors in the first block was not significant, however reaction times for correct movements were consistently longer for shape coded conditions. Elevation directional errors in the horizontal CRR1 condition was minimised in all cases, regardless of whether the control movement and the response were spatially corresponding or not. Similar results were seen for the extension control in the horizontal and vertical CRR1 conditions. In other situations, directional errors were less likely when there was spatial correspondence between the movement of the control lever and the response. While only limited evidence was found to indicate that shape coding reduced the probability of selection errors being made in this situation, the observation that the time taken to make correct responses was consistently longer in the shape coded conditions could be interpreted from an information processing, stage model, perspective as indicating that the additional information available in the shape coding was being processed during the decision making stage. It may be that the effect on selection error rate would have been larger if more controls were involved. The results indicate that directional compatibility effects are not as straightforward as the current standards and guidelines suggest. In most, but not all, situations it is important to ensure that control-response relationships correspond spatially.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">equipment design</field><field name="subject">coding</field><field name="subject">control-response relationship</field><field name="subject">directional compatibility</field><field name="subject">simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:162819</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Causes and consequences of intra-household inequality on poverty determination: The case of semi-urban Indo-Fijian households</field><field name="creator">Sunil Kumar</field><field name="description">The thesis considers two pertinent questions about poverty in Fiji. One is about the accuracy of the poverty measures calculated by the concerned organisations and this relates to the use of equivalence scales and the general style of analysis. The other more intricate question is the disregard for poverty due to intra-family distribution asymmetries. Such miscalculations of poverty arise due use of average household per capita expenditure to represent consumption. This research attempts to answer the question of whether the tendency to underestimate the incidence of poverty by disregarding intra-family inequality is significant. Furthermore, it attempts to determine the causes of these inequalities. The issue is whether the classical method of data analysis (using the family as a unit) is the ideal way of analysing poverty and distribution in societies where large family structures exist and government relief remains minimal. To determine the household inequalities, household expenditures have been disaggregated into individualised expenditures. The individualised consumption expenditure is analysed and compared with the outcomes of aggregate household expenditure data. The analysis provides overwhelming evidence for underestimation of poverty when household consumption expenditures are used.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">340000 Economics</field><field name="subject">Intra-household Inequality; Inequality Indices; Poverty; Poverty Measurement; Poverty indices, poverty lines, household incomes; household expenditures, household surveys, absolute poverty and relative poverty</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:163266</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Approach to Ecological Mission in and Through the Christian Community in Australia: Beyond Apathy to Committed Action</field><field name="creator">Clive Ayre</field><field name="description">The thesis sets out to consider the role of the Christian Church in the context of the emergent ecological crisis. The essential context for such a study is twofold. First, within the Australian Church there is clearly a dominant emphasis on an anthropocentric mission strategy, and consequently it will be argued that such a position is inadequate. Second, it will be argued that it can almost be taken as a &#8220;given&#8221; that the ecological or environmental crisis facing life on planet Earth is immediate and critical, and covers a range of well-documented categories &#8211; global warming, extreme weather events, degradation of the soil, and other factors. The loss of bio-diversity is gathering pace, while the threat to iconic features such as the Great Barrier Reef is very real. Even just from a pragmatic or humanitarian point of view, it seems important for the Christian Church to be part of a global response. From that background the thesis proceeds in three essential stages. The first issue is the identification of a sound ecological theology, or ecotheology. From the background of a large and increasing volume of literature, a range of both human-centred and eco-friendly theological positions is considered, concluding with an argument in favour of theistic biocentrism, but acknowledging that a responsible Christian environmental response may emerge from other theological positions. Thus, the thesis proposes that in addition to the scientific evidence, there is a compelling theological argument for Christian action in caring for the environment as God&#8217;s creation, and this represents a clear rationale for eco-mission. In the second part, the issue that is considered is the range of existing theologies of mission. This literature has tended to be strongly anthropocentric and very weak in the ecological area; however, there is an increasing volume of literature demonstrating a shift in emphasis towards an enhanced awareness of an ecological dimension, and in identifying that trend the thesis seeks to develop an eco-mission theology. However, there is still a perception in many congregations and denominations that ecology is not really part of the Church&#8217;s agenda. While practical action guidance models are not common, this thesis aims to challenge such a perception, and to change the culture of apathy and non-involvement in building on a foundation of ecotheology and a theology of eco-mission. Third, the thesis then explores the range and extent of Christian eco-mission, beginning with a study of how that is practised in England, and continuing with a comparative study of emerging eco-mission activity in Australia. Thus, it addresses the fundamental question as to why Christian denominations (and, by implication, local congregations) are not more actively involved in ecological mission, and explore possibilities for that position to be changed. The thesis is set within a practical theology paradigm, and employs a qualitative methodology. This involves a series of interviews supplemented by written comments and personal observations, from which dominant themes will be drawn and analysed. Thus the thesis is designed to help the Christian community to understand the seriousness of the situation as well as the biblical and theological rationale for appropriate action in &#8220;the greening of mission&#8221; and the establishment of an Australian eco-church model. In grasping the ecological aspects of its divine charter in caring for God&#8217;s creation, the Church may operate with greater confidence alongside other concerned people and groups in the community.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">440000 Philosophy and Religion</field><field name="subject">Ecotheology; eco-mission; ecology; environment; biocentrism, anthropocentrism; theocentrism; stewardship</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:163691</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the role of ectoderm neural cortex 1 in osteoblast differentiation</field><field name="creator">Leah Worton</field><field name="description">The need for anabolic therapies to increase bone formation in difficult orthopaedic circumstances and to treat osteoporosis is an area of intense research focus. There is a current interest in the Wnt signalling pathway as a target for such treatment, with accumulating evidence for a role of this pathway in bone formation. Ectoderm Neural Cortex 1 (ENC1) is a Wnt target gene, not previously studied in bone, which was observed in our laboratory to be up-regulated in an anabolic surgical model of bone formation. The involvement of ENC1 in the differentiation of neuronal and adipocytic cells has previously been reported; therefore, this thesis investigates the expression of ENC1 in cells of the bone and the role of ENC1 during osteoblast differentiation. ENC1 transcript expression was localised to osteoblastic, chondrocytic and osteocytic cells in sections of healing fracture callus and normal mouse bone by in situ hybridisation. The expression of ENC1 was confirmed in differentiating primary osteoblasts and in osteoblastic and osteosarcoma cell lines by quantitative real time PCR and western blotting. ENC1 exists as two protein isoforms of 67 and 57kD in size, which are translated from alternatively spliced ENC1 transcripts. Both isoforms of the protein were detected in differentiating cultures of the pre-osteoblast cell line MC3T3-E1. To address the function of ENC1 in osteoblast differentiation, shRNA knockdown of the endogenous transcript was undertaken in MG63 osteosarcoma cells and in the MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblastic differentiation model. Stable expression of shRNA targeted to both ENC1 spliceforms resulted in reduced accumulation of alkaline phosphatase positive nodules and alkaline phosphatase transcripts in MG63 cell culture. This reduction was not seen with targeted knockdown of 67kD ENC1 alone. Stable tetracycline-inducible shRNA knockdown targeted to both 57 and 67kD ENC1 isoforms in MC3T3-E1 cells resulted in a significant reduction of Alizarin Red S stained mineralised nodules. When expression of 67kD ENC1 alone was reduced, however, a significant increase in MC3T3-E1 nodule formation was observed. This knockdown had no effect on the expression of early genes involved in osteoblast differentiation Runx2 and osterix, but changes in expression of alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin mRNA mirrored nodule formation. ENC1 is a member of the BTB-Kelch family of proteins. Some members of this family have recently been found to act as substrate adaptors for the E3 ubiquitin ligase, binding to the cullin 3 component of the complex. These adaptor proteins function to bring a substrate protein within the vicinity of the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, thus targeting it for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. The ability of ENC1 to interact with cullin 3 was investigated as a possible mechanism by which it may affect a role in osteoblast differentiation. Full length ENC1 showed robust binding to cullin 3 and weak binding was seen between the N-terminally truncated 57kD isoform and cullin 3. ENC1, therefore, may act as a substrate adaptor protein for the cullin 3 based E3 ubiquitin ligase. These data present ENC1 as a novel candidate protein involved in osteoblast differentiation, and suggest the possible involvement of this protein in proteasomal degradation of a substrate involved in osteoblast differentiation. The ENC1 isoforms and the associated functional pathways thus are possible future therapeutic targets to treat bone loss and enhance or accelerate fracture healing.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ENC1</field><field name="subject">osteoblast differentiation</field><field name="subject">proteasomal degradation</field><field name="subject">BTB-Kelch</field><field name="subject">Cullin 3</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:163733</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Catastrophes, resilience, and the theory of designing marine reserves</field><field name="creator">Edward Game</field><field name="description">Chronic anthropogenic disturbance has left many marine systems at risk of degrading into undesirable states. In many cases, ecosystem shifts are triggered by catastrophic disturbance events that are beyond the control of local management, such as coral bleaching or cyclones. Recognition of this risk has instigated what has been referred to as a new paradigm for marine stewardship; managing areas with the explicit goal of maintaining ecosystem resilience. Despite this, there has been little synthetic influence of resilience theory on marine conservation planning. This thesis focuses on how to make good decisions regarding the selection of marine protected areas (MPAs), in the face of catastrophic disturbance events and for the conservation of highly dynamic marine systems. Large-scale catastrophic events, although rare, lie generally beyond the control of local management and can prevent marine reserves from achieving biodiversity outcomes. In Chapter 2, I formulate a new conservation planning problem that aims to minimize the probability of missing marine conservation targets as result of catastrophic events. To illustrate this approach, I address the problem of minimizing the impact of large scale coral bleaching events on a reserve system for the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. By explicitly considering the threat of catastrophic bleaching as part of the reserve design problem, it was possible to substantially improve the likely persistence of coral reefs within reserve networks, for a negligible increase in reserve cost. The results also demonstrate that simply aiming to protect the reefs at lowest risk of catastrophic bleaching does not necessarily lead to the best conservation outcomes. It is thought that recovery of marine habitats from uncontrollable disturbance may be faster in marine reserves than in unprotected habitats. But which marine habitats should be protected, those areas at greatest risk or those at least risk? In Chapter 3, I define this problem mathematically for two alternate conservation objectives and determine under which conditions each of the different protection strategies are optimal. With regard to the risk of uncontrollable disturbance, the optimal protection strategy depends on both the conservation objective and the expected rate of habitat recovery inside and outside protected areas. I illustrate this decision making with an example of cyclone disturbance of coral reefs on Australia&#8217;s Great Barrier Reef. An adequate consideration of risk can indicate surprising routes to conservation success. The resilience of coral reef systems is closely linked to the presence of grazing herbivores. Although herbivore populations are generally protected through permanent static reserves, the benefits of protection are dynamic in both time and space. Periodically moving protection between reefs allows access to the greatest potential benefits of reservation and can help address social reluctance to permanently close areas. Using analytic methods to solve a theoretical case study, I demonstrate that periodically rotating protection around a reef system can lead to greater average reef resilience than under static protection, but only if the overall level of reservation is high enough or the rotation does not include all reefs in the system. The past ten years have seen increasing enthusiasm for MPAs as a tool for pelagic conservation. However, numerous criticisms have been levelled against the use of place-based management in such a dynamic environment. Evidence, tools and information to address these criticisms and establish the feasibility and relevance of pelagic MPAs are dispersed across the conservation, oceanography and fisheries management literature. In Chapter 5, I review this information and present a synthetic framework for systematic planning of pelagic MPAs. Although many of the lessons learned so far about MPA design in coastal systems can be transferred to pelagic systems, there are some fundamental differences and new challenges involved in the conservation of patchy and highly dynamic resources. These challenges are very much at the leading edge of new conservation science and are likely to stimulate solutions with impact far beyond the design of pelagic MPAs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">marine protected areas, reserve selection, catastrophes, resilience, risk, coral reefs, conservation planning, Great Barrier Reef, pelagic ecosystems</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:164059</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Global Analysis Of Transcriptional Control Driving Zebrafish Gastrulation</field><field name="creator">Simon Wilkins</field><field name="description">Gastrulation, literally &#8220;formation of the gut&#8221; is ultimately an inadequate term to describe one of the most dynamic periods during vertebrate developmental biology. During gastrulation coordinated cell movements reshape the non-descript blastula into the structured gastrula and simultaneously specify the three germ layers: endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm. The morphogenetic movements of gastrulation are highly conserved between species, but the links between their genetic and biomechanical regulation are poorly understood. The zebrafish embryo &#8211; externally hatched, optically clear and amenable to genetic manipulation &#8211; is an ideal vertebrate model in which to study both morphogenetic movements and their genetic control. This thesis provides a detailed analysis of the zebrafish Mix-type homeobox transcription factor, Mtx2, both in terms of its role in gastrulation and the molecular mechanisms regulated by Mtx2. This approach involved detailed examination of the Mtx2 loss-of-function phenotype and, subsequently, use of this phenotype as the basis for a microarray screen to identify and investigate Mtx2-dependent genes. One specific Mtx2-dependent gene, katanin-like 1 was investigated further by loss-of-function studies. Prior to this study the mtx2 gene was identified by homology, within its homeodomain, to other Mix-family transcription factors, but both its function and transcriptional targets remained unknown. Using a morpholino knockdown approach, this thesis demonstrates that Mtx2 is essential for vegetal movement (epiboly), but not specification, of the embryonic germ layers and extra-embryonic tissues during zebrafish gastrulation. The recruitment of filamentous actin (F-actin) to a punctate band at the blastoderm margin, was previously shown to be responsible for progression of epiboly. However, formation of this structure is demonstrated to be Mtx2-dependent. Microarray expression profiling of the Mtx2 loss-of-function phenotype was performed to screen for novel genes with roles in gastrulation. This approach identified Mtx2-dependent genes with roles in cytoskeletal dynamics, cell-cell adhesion and endocytosis and vesicular trafficking &#8211; processes known to be involved in morphogenetic movements. Many Mtx2-dependent genes are co-expressed with mtx2 in the extra-embryonic yolk syncytial layer (YSL), the teleost functional equivalent of mammalian visceral endoderm. The subset of Mtx2-dependent genes co-expressed with mtx2 and that contain Mtx2-binding sites within their 2kb proximal promoter represent the genes with the greatest likelihood of being direct Mtx2 transcriptional targets. A novel homologue of the microtubule severing protein Katanin, known as katanin-like 1 (katnal1) met all these conditions. Morpholino knockdown of Katnal1 demonstrates that like Mtx2, Katnal1 is essential for gastrulation in zebrafish. A cloned Katnal1mCherry fusion construct was observed to associate with microtubules, and demonstrated bi-directional trafficking around transfected mammalian cells. Analysis of the microtubule network in wild-type and morpholino injected zebrafish embryos demonstrated that remodelling of the extensive microtubule network found in the YSL and yolk cytoplasmic layer (YCL) is Katnal1-dependent. Nuclear division within the YSL and F-actin recruitment to the blastoderm margin are also Katnal1-dependent. This thesis therefore demonstrates, for the first time directly, the multiple, specific roles played by the microtubule network of the YSL/YCL. Katnal1 is highly conserved from Drosophila to mammals and is dynamically expressed during mouse gastrulation. The Mtx2 binding motif in the katnal1 2kb proximal promoter can be bound by both Mtx2 and its putative mouse homologue Mixl1. This suggests that katnal1 may also be a direct target of Mtx2. At the technical level, these results demonstrate the validity of screening for novel developmentally important genes using a zebrafish microarray-based approach, the potential of such an approach to, ab initio, identify a candidate list of transcription factor targets and confirm the utility of the zebrafish as a developmental model. At the biological level, this work collectively suggests that Mtx2 is a central regulator of the morphogenetic movement of epiboly and that Katnal1-dependent microtubule remodelling drives multiple aspects of gastrulation, potentially from Drosophila through to humans.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">zebrafish</field><field name="subject">Gastrulation Movements</field><field name="subject">Transcription Factor</field><field name="subject">Microarray</field><field name="subject">Vertebrate Development</field><field name="subject">Vertebrate Embryogenesis</field><field name="subject">Microtubule Dynamics</field><field name="subject">Epiboly</field><field name="subject">Developmental Biology</field><field name="subject">Microtubule</field><field name="subject">Biomechanical Properties</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:164062</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Yonggi Cho's Understanding of the Holy Spirit</field><field name="creator">Dongkyu Kim</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates Yonggi Cho's conception of Seongnyeong Undong (the Holy Spirit Movement: HSM) in his pastoral ministry activity at the Yoido Full Gospel Church (YFGC) in Korea. First of all, it examines how Cho's HSM developed at the YFGC from an historical perspective. Secondly, it discusses Cho's main theology and investigates this theology from a systematic theological perspective. Thirdly, it focuses on Cho's belief and practice from a practical, theological perspective. Some scholars say that Cho's theology, belief and practice, particularly of material blessings and Sinyu (divine healing) in his ministry, are similar to those in Korean shamanism. However, other scholars argue that his theological ideas came from the Bible and western theological doctrines and Westerners. The present study assesses these different arguments and concludes that Cho tried to base his theological ideas and his ministry activity on biblical foundations rather than on shamanistic and other Korean traditional cultures, even if he used Korean terms to describe them. The study is mainly based on literary research and is divided into five chapters. Chapter 1 introduces the overall focus of the study. Chapter 2 examines the life and ministry of Yonggi Cho, and the development of Yonggi Cho's understanding of the HSM in his pastoral care since 1958. Using a historical theological method this chapter also shows how Yonggi Cho developed the HSM at the YFGC in his ministry through his written work. Chapter 3 deals with Yonggi Cho's theological background and his core theology &#8212; how he understands the HSM, and the root of HSM from systematic theological perspectives. It shows where his main theology came from on the basis of evidence provided in his numerous writings. Chapter 4 emphasises Yonggi Cho's understanding of the Holy Spirit (HS) in his belief and practice. It shows where his belief and practice came from, and discusses what his main belief and practices are from practical theological views. Chapter 5 concludes the study. Three main conclusions are drawn with regard to the 1) historical theological, 2) systematic theological, and 3) practical theological perspectives on Yonggi Cho's understanding of the HS. The thesis concludes that Cho was much more influenced by biblical and western understandings than he was by shamanism or by other Korean traditions, even though he borrowed words from their language.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">The Holy Spirit</field><field name="subject">The Holy Spirit Movement</field><field name="subject">Korean Pentecostal Church</field><field name="subject">Yoido Full Gospel Church</field><field name="subject">Yonggi Cho</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:164170</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Time course of movement preparation of rapid interceptive actions</field><field name="creator">Welber Marinovic</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">human</field><field name="subject">movement</field><field name="subject">motor preparation</field><field name="subject">motor control</field><field name="subject">inhibition</field><field name="subject">interception</field><field name="subject">readiness</field><field name="subject">time-tocontact</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:164401</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prognostication in Low Back Pain:A Biopsychosocial Index</field><field name="creator">John Nicholas Penney</field><field name="description">Abstract Introduction. The biopsychosocial model has developed over the last forty years since Melzac and Wall first stated the need to broaden the biomedical view of pain mechanisms. The biopsychosocial concept is now central in contemporary understanding of human health and functioning in general, and pain in particular. An extensive biopsychosocial literature on low back pain has emerged since the paradigm shift of nearly thirty years ago, and has been reflected in evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on musculoskeletal pain. The estimation of prognosis from an episode of low back pain is particularly important to clinicians, patients, employers and third party payers. The instruments currently available however, quantify prognostic factors from a biomedical perspective, rather than the contemporary biopsychosocial model. The successful development of the biopsychosocial instrument, reported in this thesis, fills this gap in measurement, and affirms the hypothesis advanced that it is feasible to develop a valid and reliable multidimensional index to estimate prognosis from a range of biopsychosocial variables, in low back pain. The thesis describes; &#8226; A review of pain mediation/modulation &#8226; A review of the literature on the biopsychosocial model to identify a range of variables for investigation &#8226; Consideration of different outcome measures as the gold standard criterion measure &#8226; The development of the BPIP, a novel biopsychosocial instrument designed for eventual clinical use, as a means of considering non specific low back pain from a biopsychosocial perspective, and informing prognosis in patients who do not have diagnosable levels of psychopathology Methods. The Biopsychosocial Index of Prognosis (BPIP) was developed from a content map derived from the International Classification of Functioning, Health and Disease (ICF) for use in non specific low back pain of variable duration. A prototype BPIP instrument was drafted, and a peer review process resulted in item reduction. The prototype BPIP instrument was then subjected to a twenty four hour test-retest assessment of stability, prior to assessment of the prototype BPIP&#8217;s validity and internal consistency. Questionnaire packs containing the prototype BPIP instrument, a range of other measurement instruments, an informed consent form and an instruction sheet were then issued. The data were captured at baseline, six weeks, and again at twelve weeks. Recruitment of respondents was originally intended to capture a homogeneous cohort drawn from general (medical) practice. Recruitment difficulties however resulted in two distinct cohorts, a larger Australian cohort (n = 91) and a smaller New Zealand cohort (n = 27). The larger Australian group was utilised as an elucidation cohort, and the smaller New Zealand cohort was treated as a small prospective validation of the BPIP. Item reduction was undertaken and resulted in an ordinal scale for correlation with the Roland and Morris Disability Index, the criterion measure. The resulting twenty four item BPIP scale was tested for internal consistency in both the Australian and New Zealand cohorts. The baseline data from the Australian elucidation cohort were then assessed for concurrent, predictive and construct validity against the twelve week data from The Roland and Morris Disability Index (RDQ), the selected criterion measure. The New Zealand cohort was treated as a small prospective validation of the BPIP scale, with the baseline data from the BPIP correlated with the change score from the baseline to twelve weeks, of the RDQ. Analysis was undertaken using the SPSS statistical package. Results. Correlation analysis of the baseline BPIP Australian data with the twelve week RDQ Australian data resulted in reducing the prototype scale to questions which correlated at or above 0.3, a total of twenty four questions were retained. Reliability coefficients for internal consistency of the twenty four item BPIP scale were: The Australian cohort, Cronbach&#8217;s Alpha = 0.8736. The New Zealand cohort, Cronbach&#8217;s Alpha = 0.8628. A further review of the correlation analysis of the baseline BPIP Australian data with twelve week RDQ Australian data for items that correlated at or above 0.4 resulted in further item reduction of the BPIP to twelve questions. Following this further item reduction, reliability coefficients for internal consistency were: The Australian cohort, Cronbach&#8217;s Alpha = 0.875. The New Zealand cohort, Cronbach&#8217;s Alpha = 0.776. Regression analysis of the Australian cohort based on the twelve item scale demonstrated that 61.7% of the variance in the RDQ score at twelve weeks was accounted for by the BPIP scale, with p = 0.0005. Regression analysis of the change score of the RDQ with the twelve item BPIP in the New Zealand cohort demonstrated that 78.2% of the variance in RDQ scores was accounted for by the BPIP scale, with p = 0.006. Forty five point five percent of the Australian cohort improved by more than 30%, (the proposed minimal clinically important difference of the RDQ), whilst 76.9% of the New Zealand cohort improved more than thirty percent. In a post hoc analysis of the Orebro data, the longer 25 item questionnaire accounted for 97.8% of the variance in the New Zealand cohort. Conclusion. The initial hypothesis that it would be feasible to develop a valid and reliable multidimensional instrument from a range of biopsychosocial variables into a valid instrument for estimating the prognosis of an episode of low back pain is supported by the results. The utility of a biopsychosocial instrument for routine clinical use lies in the potential to predict prognosis. As low back pain is typically a recurrent problem, information on both prognosis for recovery from episodes, and the likelihood of recurrences would be helpful to both clinician and patient. For the patient, a well communicated prognosis helps assure the patient about their future, reduces uncertainty about their pain, and establishes treatment goals within the domain of informed consent. From the clinician&#8217;s perspective, a prognostic approach shifts the focus from the pain history to future outcomes and provides a context for considering how risks of future pain and dysfunction may be reduced. The BPIP scale is a biopsychosocial, prognostic instrument, which accounts for a high degree of the variance in the RDQ scores in both cohorts. Pain amelioration and functional improvement are the two key aspects of prognosis which the BPIP has been demonstrated to be both valid and reliable in predicting at the clinically important three month time point from baseline assessment. The BPIP has been demonstrated in these cohorts, to provide a reliable estimate of prognosis from a biopsychosocial perspective. The reliability of the shortened BPIP scale remained acceptable, and allowed for the scale to be contained on a single A4 page, potentially increasing the clinical utility of the instrument. When BPIP score fails to change over time, psychosocial screening and intervention may be indicated. Future work will include further validation in other subgroups and clinical environments, identification of cut points for BPIP scores, and the performance of comparative studies of the relative value of different purported prognostic indices. The BPIP is the first instrument developed to specifically to estimate prognosis from an episode of low back pain, in primary care, within the contemporary biopsychosocial model.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biopsychosocial</field><field name="subject">Low Back Pain</field><field name="subject">Prognosis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:164833</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing tools for flying fox (Pteropid bats) serology</field><field name="creator">Antonio Di Rubbo</field><field name="description">Abstract Pteropid bats are species of zoonotic significance and are known to be reservoir hosts of many viral diseases recently emerged in Asia and Australia. The transfer of these organisms from bats into terrestrial hosts resulted in lethal illnesses in humans and animals. Implementing attentive strategies for the detection and monitoring of these organisms is essential to the protection of humans, animals and the balance of the global economy. Unfortunately the paucity of information on these mammals&#8217; immune system and the absence of diagnostic tools for the detection and for the studying of the humoral response in these animals disengage us from responding promptly when such outbreaks occur and prevent us from describing the possible underling causes that may be responsible for the absence of symptoms in bats infected with such organisms. It was assumed that flying foxes have immunoglobulin like molecules that provide humoral response and are involved in mediating secondary effector functions such as complement fixation and activation of other components of the cellular response in a similar manner as it occurs in humans and other mammals. The aims of this study which include immunoglobulin isotype identification, purification and characterisation as well as generation of reagents that are immunoglobulin class specific, provide the primary platform that should enable us to begin examining these questions. IgG was purified from the black flying fox&#8217;s serum by affinity chromatography using Protein G and Protein A. Protein L was ineffective in purifying any antibody from the bat serum. The heavy chain of IgG was also purified by gel electroelution. IgG was digested with papain to yield Fab and Fc fragments. The identity of the bat IgG was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing of the heavy chain and light chain of immunoglobulins separated by SDS-PAGE and by N-terminal sequencing of Fc and Fc' fragments. IgM has also been purified using methods that have not been previously explored to our knowledge. These methods consisted of the purification of Fab specific antibodies from antisera generated against Fab, and using these antibodies to capture other immunoglobulin classes in samples that had been previously enriched by classical fractionation methods. Antisera against the whole IgG molecule, Fc, Fab, IgG heavy chain and IgM heavy chain have been produced in rabbits and tested by Western blot and ELISA. The antisera against the whole IgG molecule and against the Fc were also utilized to detect antibodies to Nipah virus in bats that were found positive to Serum Neutralisation Test. Failure to identify the bat IgA in the bat serum poses questions on the presence, abundance and functional significance of such molecule in bats. The tools that were generated in this study recognise immunoglobulin isotypes, which enabled us to detect and measure antibodies and will allow the study of the humoral response in infected bats to a large extent. Tedious approaches routinely adopted for the purification of antibodies involve a series of pre-fractionation steps or affinity chromatography which rely on the use of expensive immobilised novel or partially characterised ligands, with no guarantee of affinity for the immunoglobulin isotype of interest. The method adopted for immunoglubulin isotype purification described in this study proved to be an effective, reasonably quick and economic solution for immunoglubulin isotype purification from any mammalian species.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pteropid Bats</field><field name="subject">Flying foxes</field><field name="subject">Serology</field><field name="subject">Diagnostic Tools</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:164835</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-Invasive Assessment of Arterial Elasticity: Clinical Manifestations and Treatment Implications</field><field name="creator">Brian Haluska</field><field name="description">Until recently, tests of vascular structure, function and compliance have been used predominantly for assessing the efficacy of treatment &#8211; for example, aggressive medical therapy may yield improvements in vascular structure and function with a concomitant decrease in cardiac events. However, the role of abnormal vessel function in the development of atherosclerosis, and the relationship of structural changes in peripheral vessels with coronary disease might suggest that these tests could be used as a screening test for patients with subclinical coronary disease. At present, there is insufficient evidence to support the theory that normal vascular structure and function can rule out significant coronary disease, and indeed, such an association may be confounded by the presence of risk factors that alter these test results in the absence of significant coronary artery disease (CAD). The overall hypothesis of the studies undertaken in this thesis was that utilizing contemporary technology during ultrasonic and tonometric assessment of arterial structure, function and compliance, it is possible to non-invasively characterise both early and advanced arterial dysfunction and identify patients both at risk and with cardiovascular disease. The aim of these studies was to determine whether these tests can be used to guide intervention when arterial dysfunction is diagnosed and whether they are robust enough as a follow-up tool. The thesis initially reviews arterial structure, function and compliance and their relationship to cardiovascular risk and in particular, CAD. This review provides a rationale for the studies undertaken here to resolve clinical and technical issues as well as provide an insight into the tests chosen to assess arterial function. The second chapter discusses the methodology used in these studies to assess arterial structure, function and compliance, diagnose coronary artery disease and determine cardiovascular risk. They range from stress echocardiography for the diagnosis of CAD to tests for arterial structure (carotid intima-media thickness [IMT]), endothelial function (brachial artery reactivity [BAR]), local arterial distensibility (distensibility coefficient [DC]) and systemic or total arterial compliance (TAC). In addition, several methods will be discussed for assessing local arterial elasticity with a novel imaging technique. The rationale for using tests for arterial structure, function and compliance in patients with CAD as well as cardiovascular risk is examined in chapter 3. Chapter 3 examines the use of TAC, IMT and BAR in patients undergoing dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) in a group of patients with and without disease. TAC was neither an independent predictor of CAD risk or patients having CAD in this study. BAR was a predictor of risk status but not of patients having CAD. Only IMT was an independent predictor of both patients at risk for CAD and those with CAD. In chapter 3 both pulse pressure and total arterial compliance were only univariate predictors of risk for CAD. Chapter 4 examines three different methods of estimating TAC, all based on the two-element Windkessel model in 320 patients with and without cardiovascular risk. The pulse-pressure method (PPM) is based on a combination of pressure, obtained using applanation tonometry of the radial artery, and an estimate of stroke volume obtained by Doppler echocardiography of the left ventricular outflow and by 2D echocardiographic dimension of the left ventricular outflow tract. The area method (AM) is an integral variation of the Windkessel equations and is based on the derived central pressure waveform. The stroke volume-pulse pressure method (SVPP) is a simple ratio of stoke volume and pulse pressure. We conclude that they correlate well and show similar differences between groups with and without risk. The PPM had the smallest difference from the mean and standard deviation in Bland Altman analysis and we therefore used the PPM for most future studies. Chapter 5 discusses the use of tissue Doppler for the derivation of central pressure and determination of distensibility coefficient, a marker of local arterial elasticity. Tissue Doppler can be used to evaluate the low frequency, high amplitude signals which come from tissue by changing filtering settings on an ultrasound machine. Using off-line software, the tissue velocities can be extracted and with a processing algorithm, vessel wall displacement values over time can be generated. These vessel wall displacement values which are in microns (&#181;m) can then be used to calculated distensibility coefficient which is calculated as 2*((net displacement/minD)/PP). We studied a large group of patients with and without cardiovascular risk and conclude that DC using tissue Doppler correlates highly with DC by B-mode and M-mode imaging and is also very reproducible. In a subgroup, the vessel displacement values were &#8220;calibrated&#8221; using mean and diastolic pressure and with specialised software and a transfer function, central pressure wave forms were reconstructed. In this study we conclude that the central pressure obtained using tissue Doppler displacement of the carotid artery correlates highly with that obtained using applanation tonometry although there are technical challenges involved. With the known prognostic value of pulse pressure, chapter 6 explores whether there is added benefit to measuring total arterial compliance over pulse pressure alone. Once again patients with and without disease were studied and we conclude that brachial pulse pressure correlates well with TAC in men with normal cardiac function. However, in women and in patients at the low and high extremes of function, and in patients with preclinical and overt cardiovascular disease, there appears to be incremental value in measuring TAC. The role of cardiovascular risk factors in association with TAC is examined in chapter 7. Several studies have shown that TAC is lower in certain groups due to age, height, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia or other factors. We studied 720 patients with and without cardiovascular risk factors and did several multiple linear regression models based on anthropomorphic variables. Age was an independent correlate of TAC in most of the regression models and we conclude that TAC is associated with multiple risk factors, but age is a major determinant. The influence of age and other correlates may dwarf the contribution of individual risk factors and therefore their alteration with therapy. Chapter 8 examines the correlates of preclinical cardiovascular disease in both indigenous and non-indigenous Australians with and without diabetes mellitus (DM). DM is a major health problem in the Indigenous population in Australia and CVD occurs earlier in this group than in caucasians and is responsible for 1/3 of all deaths. We studied a large group of indigenous Australians with and without DM and matched them to a caucasian population. There were no differences in BAR between the groups probably due to large standard deviations in the measurements. In assessing DC, both DM groups had significantly lower DC than the non-DM groups. However, in the IMT analysis both of the indigenous groups had significantly higher IMT than their caucasian counterparts and even after IMT was corrected for age, Indigenous patients even at an early age had significantly higher IMT. We conclude that despite a high incidence of risk factors in indigenous Australians both with and without DM, ethnicity (and various other risk factors for which it is a marker) appears to be an independent predictor of preclinical cardiovascular disease. In chapter 3 we determined that TAC was not an independent correlate of patients either at risk of CAD or with CAD. Chapter 9 discusses the results of a study of patients presenting for stress echocardiography for either detection of CAD or risk stratification. Ischaemia was detected in 25% of cases and TAC was similar in those with and without ischaemia. In multiple linear regression models however, in addition to cardiovascular risk factors TAC was independently associated with both the presence of CAD and the extent of ischaemia at stress echocardiography. Several studies have used vascular function as an outcome measure in intervention trials, either lifestyle or pharmacologic. In chapter 10 we undertook a lifestyle and diet intervention study in a large group of healthy patients with type-II DM. The tests for IMT, BAR and TAC were used in addition to biochemical markers and fitness assessment. At follow-up the intervention group had significant changes in weight and BMI and significantly increased fitness but failed to show any changes in any of the vascular parameters. We conclude that while metabolic and fitness parameters respond to treatment in patients with type-II DM, the early changes seen in vascular structure, function and compliance may not change in the long term. Although TAC has been correlated with hypertension, LVH, myocardial ischaemia and heart failure there are few data existing regarding the relationship of TAC to outcome. In the final chapter of this thesis we sought whether TAC was predictive of outcome in a large, primary prevention group of patients with varying degrees of cardiovascular risk. We followed up 719 patients who were studied between 2001 and 2008 in Brisbane, Australia and examined TAC in relation to mortality and a composite endpoint of death or hospital admission. There were significant differences in groups having low and normal TAC for both death and the composite endpoint and in patients with intermediate and high Framingham 10-year risk TAC was an independent predictor of both death and the composite endpoint.

In addressing the problem of how teachers choose to bring clarity to competing values education discourses, this research comprises two parts. The first part is an analysis of a key policy text, the National Framework for Values Education in Australian Schools (2005). The second part focuses on fourteen interviews with seven primary school classroom teachers conducted at different times during one school term. Each teacher was interviewed twice. The interviews were treated as objects of analysis and not just as an information source. The informal theories that underpin the policy and interview texts are analysed through James Paul Gee&#8217;s (2005) lens of &#8220;Discourse models&#8221;. This is a critical discourse approach to analysing a social phenomenon, with analytic focus placed on the language in the texts, as well as the localised and broader social context in which the language is situated. The way in which the policy and interview texts functioned strategically was analysed. The Discourse models evident in the texts were then identified through the use of &#8216;storylines&#8217; as an analytic tool. In identifying Discourse models, insight was gained into how the official policy and the teacher participants in the study conceptualised values education. Analysis of the policy document showed how the text acted strategically to build legitimacy and the appearance of consensus surrounding the approach to values education advocated in the document. The storyline that emerged was one of the Australian Federal Government as a &#8216;hero&#8217; intervening in values education to save young people who are at moral risk in the 21st century. Analysis of the interview transcripts showed how these texts also acted strategically to build legitimacy and the appearance that each participant&#8217;s approach to values education was right, normal and needed. A similar storyline emerged in the interview texts, where young people were in need of rescuing due to the moral peril of current times but it was the teacher participants who were now in the role of &#8216;hero&#8217;. The teacher participants in the study showed that they called upon a multiplicity of social roles, everything they were as moral beings, in their efforts to rescue students. The results indicate that there is both alignment and fragmentation in the Discourse models identified in both the policy and interview texts. Values education was conceived of in largely behavioural terms, where values were fixed, and change towards these value norms was focused on the individual behaviour of the student. Alignment centred on a dominant &#8216;salvation&#8217; story in the texts that regarded values education as a way to rescue students from moral peril. This master model of the salvation story was fractured, however, by the experiences of the classroom teachers in the study. Most poignant was that not all students were able to be rescued despite the best of professed intentions. There are several implications emerging from these findings. First, the explicit move towards fixed values norms has exclusionary effects. Second, the focus on changing the behaviour of students as individuals ignores systemic levels of oppression. Third, and overall, the didactic teaching of values creates tensions over the perceived interference of the state in the lives of young people. Recommendations emerging from the study include that teachers be given increased opportunities to become more aware of their own values systems, the impact of these in the classroom; and develop their understanding of the broader social structures in which values education in classrooms is situated. This awareness is a necessary complement to the official discourses of values education in Australia in order to mitigate the potential exclusionary effects of policy. 130105 Primary Education 35%, 160506 Education policy 35%, 1399 Other Education 30%</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Values Education</field><field name="subject">Critical Discourse Analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:164956</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cellular role for Developmentally Regulated G-proteins in plants: Heat stress and protein renaturation.</field><field name="creator">Anthony O'Connell</field><field name="description">Developmentally regulated G-proteins (DRGs) are a highly conserved family of GTP binding proteins found in archaea, plants, fungi and animals. Their function is poorly understood but they are implicated in cell division, proliferation, and growth, as well as several human medical conditions. The research reported here has utilised a variety of approaches including structural biology, biochemistry, expression profiling, and mutant analysis in order to investigate the cellular function of DRG proteins in plants. Recombinant, biologically active atDRG1 and atDRG2 protein from Arabidopsis thaliana was purified using in vitro refolding and was used in both structural studies and biochemical analysis. Crystallographic studies were carried out for both atDRG1 and atDRG2 across 3840 unique, independent crystallisation conditions for each protein. Heterogeneous nucleation was also used in a separate crystallography screen in order to induce nucleation and subsequent crystal growth however no diffraction quality protein crystal were produced in this study. The nucleotide binding and hydrolysis properties of recombinant atDRG1 and atDRG2 were measured in vitro, representing the first biochemical characterisation of DRG proteins. Both atDRG1 and atDRG2 were found to bind GDP and GTP in vitro without the assistance of exogenous exchange or activation factors. The Kcat for GTP hydrolysis by atDRG1 and atDRG2 was found to be 7.44 x 10-4 min-1 and 1.18 x 10-3 min-1 respectively which is consistent with proteins related to the DRG subfamily. An Arabidopsis thaliana atDRG2a knockout mutant was identified and characterised in this study as well representing the first DRG knockout mutant in a multicellular organism. We found that complete knockout of atDRG2a is not lethal in Arabidopsis and that the nearly identical atDRG2b protein is not upregulated in response to an absence of atDRG2a in the cell. The mutant did not display an obvious phenotype compared to wild-type. The expression profiles of the three Arabidopsis thaliana drg genes, drg1, drg2a, and drg2b, were characterised using drg promoter:GUS Arabidopsis transgenics and revealed several interesting features. Under normal conditions, drg1 and drg2a transcripts are present in all cells whilst drg2b transcripts are undetectable. When heat stress is applied, drg2b and drg1 are specifically up regulated and drg2a is not. During seed imbibition, drg2a and drg1 are specifically upregulated whilst drg2b is not. The expression pattern of the drg family closely mirrors that of chaperone/heat shock proteins and this would agree with previous research that suggests that DRG2a may perform a chaperone role. The ability of DRGs to bind nucleotides without assistance, their slow rate of GTP hydrolysis, heat stress activation, abundance in seeds, cytosolic localization, and domain conservation, all agree with the models proposed for spoOB associated G-protein (Obg) function, whereby Obgs stabilise or refold ribosomes or other proteins in response to stress. It is possible that DRGs perform a similar and complementary function to Obgs, specifically during heat stress, despite the low level of sequence conservation between Obgs and DRGs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DRG</field><field name="subject">Developmentally regulated G-protein</field><field name="subject">Arabidopsis</field><field name="subject">Heat</field><field name="subject">Refolding</field><field name="subject">GTP</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:164999</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Making them Indonesians: Child transfers out of East Timor</field><field name="creator">Helene Van Klinken</field><field name="description">This thesis is a history of Indonesian colonialism in East Timor told through the lens of East Timorese children transferred to Indonesia. During the Indonesian occupation of East Timor, between 1975 and 1999, individuals and institutions representing the occupying power transferred many East Timorese children and young people to Indonesia to receive an Indonesian education. Among them were approximately four thousand young, dependent children. The story of the transfers provides a rich and textured insight into the socio-cultural aspect of the Indonesia-East Timor relationship. This dimension is often missing in the academic literature on East Timor, which has been mainly concerned with the &#8220;big issues&#8221;&#8212;politics, security, international relations and human rights. The thesis is also a history &#8220;from below,&#8221; of the marginalised and weak whose perspective is often ignored in accounts of national histories. From the transfers we learn of East Timorese taking up the many generous educational opportunities offered by the Indonesians, opportunities denied to most East Timorese during the Portuguese colonial era. The transfers reveal Indonesians from all backgrounds showing compassion towards destitute and vulnerable East Timorese children, some of whom would have died had they not been taken in by Indonesians. Some of the children were adopted and lovingly raised in homes in Indonesia, while others were cared for in state-run or religious institutions. However, the transfers also expose the patronising attitudes of many Indonesians who regarded the East Timorese as backward and primitive. The Indonesians were so sure of their good intentions that they justified delivering development, including transferring children, often in breach of the rights of the East Timorese: some children were taken against their wishes; some parents were coerced or forced to hand over their children; some children were abused and neglected in their adoptive homes and in the institutions caring for them. Further, Indonesia&#8217;s proclaimed altruism in developing the territory was underpinned by other motives, as is exemplified by the transfers, in which political, ideological, personal, religious and economic motives, not humanitarian concern alone, were key factors. The refusal of the international community to recognise Indonesia&#8217;s claim over East Timor played a significant role in leading Indonesians to demonstrate their concern to develop East Timor, which included providing educational opportunities and caring for destitute children in their homes and institutions. However, the Indonesian authorities also hoped that these East Timorese students and children, raised in Indonesia as Indonesians, would contribute to affording legitimacy to integration. The thesis highlights the appropriation of vulnerable and dependent children in political projects of control; in themselves the children embodied the aim of the Indonesians for all East Timorese&#8212;namely, to make them Indonesians. The thesis is the first attempt to provide a detailed account and analysis of these child transfers. Besides providing a set of new data, it is an example of the multifaceted nature of colonial relationships and the ambiguities and complexities they embody. The story also continues to be important in this post-colonial era as it enriches our understanding of the new relationship that is developing across an entirely different border, between newly-democratic Indonesia and independent East Timor.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">East Timor</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Child Transfers</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:165037</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What Happens to &#8216;Big Ideas&#8217; at the Front Line of Human Services : The Case of Service User Rights</field><field name="creator">Crane, Phil R.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">370000 Studies in Human Society</field><field name="subject">L</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:165168</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Persistent Virus Infection and T Cell Receptor Selection</field><field name="creator">Katherine Kay Wynn</field><field name="description">Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a &#946;-herpesvirus that establishes a life-long presence in the infected host. The adaptive immune response is indispensable in controlling HCMV infection. Consequently, healthy individuals show no or mild symptoms following primary infection. In contrast, immunocompromised individuals who develop primary infection or recrudescence of HCMV can experience severe morbidity, and sometimes mortality. HCMV-specific T cell populations undergo changes in the architecture of their T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire following each episode of viral reactivation. A diverse TCR repertoire is thought to be required to provide the most efficient protection against virus infection. Perturbation to this repertoire, as can occur in immunocompromised individuals following transplantation, can lead to an increase risk of developing virus-associated clinical disease. Therefore, the study of factors influencing TCR selection is critically important in both healthy and immunocompromised individuals. To further understand the factors governing TCR selection in a persistent virus infection, the current thesis examined this process in different settings. CD8+ T cell responses to persistent viral infections are characterised by the accumulation of T cells exhibiting an oligoclonal T cell repertoire, with a parallel reduction in the na&#239;ve T cell pool. However, the precise mechanism for this phenomenon remains elusive. Here, we showed that HCMV-specific CD8+ T cells recognising distinct epitopes from the pp65 protein and restricted through an identical HLA class I allele (HLA B*3508) exhibited either a highly conserved public T cell repertoire, or a private, diverse T cell response, which was uniquely altered in each donor following in vitro antigen exposure. Selection of a public TCR was co-incident with an atypical peptide-MHC (pMHC) structure, whereby the epitope adopted a helical conformation that bulged from the peptide-binding groove, whilst a diverse TCR profile was observed in response to the epitope that formed a flatter, more &#8216;featureless&#8217; landscape. Clonotypes with biased TCR usage demonstrated more efficient recognition of virus-infected cells, a greater CD8 dependency, and were more terminally differentiated in their phenotype when compared to the T cells expressing diverse TCR. These findings provide new insights into our understanding of how the biology of antigen presentation, in addition to the structural features of the pMHC, might shape the T cell phenotype and its corresponding repertoire architecture. Next, the role of HCMV in shaping the global and antigen-specific TCR repertoire in healthy donors was examined. First, exposure to HCMV led to an inflation of terminally differentiated CD57-expressing T cells. This effect was not seen in HCMV seronegative individuals who showed evidence of exposure to another persistent herpesvirus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). More importantly, these terminally differentiated CD8+ T cells in HCMV-exposed individuals displayed a highly skewed architecture of their peripheral blood T cell repertoire, with large monoclonal/oligoclonal expansions. However, ex vivo analyses of HCMV-specific T cells revealed a heterogeneous pattern of CD57 expression that showed no correlation to the antigenic source of its cognate epitope. Based on these observations, we proposed that exposure to HCMV drives the differentiation of not only the global T cell population, but select HCMV-specific T cell populations as well, and that expression of CD57 by these cells was co-incident with an oligoclonal T cell repertoire. Finally, the TCR repertoire was examined in a cohort of solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, where primary infection or recrudescence of latent virus infection can be manifested either as asymptomatic or symptomatic disease. We examined 18 SOT recipients, and observed that symptomatic HCMV or EBV infection or recrudescence following solid organ transplantation was co-incident with a dramatic skewing of the TCR repertoire, with expansions of monoclonal/oligoclonal clonotypes. As the clinical symptoms resolved, the peripheral blood repertoire reverted to a more diverse distribution. In contrast, SOT recipients with asymptomatic or no HCMV/EBV infection or recrudescence showed minimal or no skewing of the TCR repertoire, and maintained TCR repertoire diversity. Interestingly, this disparate repertoire showed no correlation with levels of viral load in the peripheral blood. More importantly, we showed that large monoclonal/oligoclonal repertoire expansions was linked to the loss of antigen-specific T cell function observed in SOT patients undergoing symptomatic viral infection or recrudescence, while SOT recipients who maintained peripheral blood TCR repertoire diversity and functional antigen-specific T cell responses could resist clinical symptomatic disease in spite of high levels of viral load. Therefore, the work presented in this thesis provides additional evidence on the factors governing TCR selection in HCMV-exposed healthy individuals, as well as the consequences that perturbation to the TCR repertoire has on the functionality of the T cell compartment in immunocompromised individuals.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Virus</field><field name="subject">T Cells</field><field name="subject">T Cell Receptor</field><field name="subject">Human Leukocyte Antigen</field><field name="subject">Transplantation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:165289</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis and Applications of Novel Periodic Mesoporous Organosilicas</field><field name="creator">Chun Xiang (Cynthia) Lin</field><field name="description">Synthesis and Applications of Novel Periodic Mesoporous Organosilicas by Chun Xiang (Cynthia) LIN Abstract This dissertation is concerned with the synthesis, functionalization, and applications of periodic mesoporous organosilica (PMO) with a unique hollow spherical morphology, with the main objectives as follows: &#8226; Developing new techniques to synthesize mesoporous silica and organosilica materials &#8226; Designing different approaches to modify PMO and silica materials to meet various applications &#8226; Developing innovative applications of novel PMO materials in biological fields. The key features that have been achieved in this work are highlighted as follows: &#8226; A series of studies has been carried out and resulted in a new strategy for the synthesis of PMO material with a novel hollow morphology. This new approach employs both hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon surfactants as mixed structure-directing-agents in alkaline medium. Moreover, a vesicle and liquid crystal "dual-templating" mechanism has been proposed. &#8226; Detailed observation on the formation mechanism of hollow PMO has revealed that the demixing temperature (Td) plays an important role on the formation of highly ordered mesostructure of PMO hollow spheres. Beside that, dissimilarity on the hydrophobic nature of silica - organic silica precursors has brought differences in the resulted materials. &#8226; Different approaches in the modification of PMO hollow spheres with several functional groups and commercial magnetic ferrite nanoparticles have shown some unique features of this material. It was found that different reactive sites of each functional group bring different disruptive effect on the mesopore geometry of hollow PMO. Furthermore, hollow PMO material show different behavior on encapsulating the commercial magnetic ferrite nanoparticles compared to superparamagnetic particles, where different techniques should be applied, which involved several factors that need to be carefully adjusted. &#8226; Applications of hollow PMO in biological field were performed on drug and DNA delivery. A comparison between periodic mesoporous silica (PMS) and PMO as drug carriers showed the differences in wall composition between pure silica and hybrid organic silica, also the morphology (hollow and solid spheres) play important roles in controlling adsorption capacity and drug release rate. In addition, different pH value of release medium also brings significant effect on release profile. As a carrier of DNA, magnetic modified hollow PMO material showed biocompatibility towards sugarcane callus. Moreover, this study has introduced a new innovative technique on delivering DNA into plant cell through the application of modified hollow PMO with barium magnetic core and enzyme digestion approach.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Periodic Mesoporous Organosilica (PMO), Periodic Mesoporous Silica (PMS), Hollow PMO,</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:165380</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of physical activity, glucosamine sulphate, and other strategies in the management of knee or hip osteoarthritis</field><field name="creator">Norman Ng</field><field name="description">Abstract Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common musculoskeletal disorder affecting Australians and is the leading cause of pain and disability in the country. There is no known cure for OA, but pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments can relieve symptoms and improve quality of life for OA sufferers: two of these are glucosamine sulphate (GS) and physical activity. Little is known about physical activity behavior and the correlates of physical activity participation among Australians with OA, or about the benefits of combining physical activity and GS for the management of OA. More generally, there is little information on the treatments used by OA sufferers in Australia. The first main aim of this thesis was to describe OA symptoms in people with hip or knee OA; their use of treatments for these symptoms; their health status; their current, past and future participation in physical activities; and their perceptions that could influence physical activity participation (Study 1). The second main aim was to compare the effectiveness of different frequencies and durations of walking, combined with GS intake, for reducing symptoms of OA and improving well-being in people with hip or knee OA (Study 2). Descriptive study (Study 1) A questionnaire was mailed to 2200 members of the Arthritis Queensland Foundation who lived in the Brisbane environs. Of these, 588 participants with hip or knee OA completed the survey. The most common treatments being used to manage osteoarthritic symptoms were weight loss (57%), range of motion exercises (56%), and strengthening exercises (49%). The most popular pharmacological treatments were glucosamine and/or chondroitin (54%) and anti-inflammatory medications (40%). Paracetamol (73%), topical liniment rubs (45%) and anti-inflammatory gels (35%) were the most commonly used &#8216;as needed&#8217; medications. Most participants had fair to good health (68%). Many reported moderate levels of anxiety and depression as well as other health problems. Hypertension was the most common health problem (43.3%). Twenty-five percent reported that health problems were preventing them from walking, and 33% reported that health problems were preventing them from doing other exercises. Fifty-nine percent were meeting Australian physical activity guidelines (30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity most days of the week). Participants reported taking part in a wide range of sports and exercises, walking being the most common. They had moderate levels of self-efficacy for, and perceived many health benefits from being physically active, but perceived a moderate number of barriers to being active. Significant associations between past participation in sports and current OA symptoms were only found for men (p &lt; 0.05), with past participation in Australian Rules football, basketball, soccer, skiing or volleyball associated with more severe symptoms in men. Feasibility study (Study 2) Thirty-six participants were given GS for 18 weeks. Starting in Week 6, they also participated in the 12-week Stepping Out walking program (after being randomly assigned to walk 3 or 5 days each week). Assessments were conducted at baseline, at Weeks 6, 12, and 18 during the intervention, and at a final follow-up during Week 24 of the study. Primary outcome measures were WOMAC pain, stiffness, physical function, and total scores and time to complete a self-paced step test, an objective measure of physical function. Comparisons were made between groups and between assessment weeks. As the data were not normally distributed, non-parametric techniques were used. Given that the study was a feasibility study, data were analysed on a per protocol basis. No significant between-group differences were found at any assessment week for the primary outcome measures. Therefore, changes between assessments were examined for the two groups combined. After 6 weeks of GS intake, WOMAC stiffness (p = 0.01) and physical function scores (p = 0.05) improved, as did physical function, measured objectively (p &lt; .001). Between Weeks 6 and 12, when participants were asked to increase their daily steps over their current steps to an extra 1500-3000 per day, physical activity minutes increased (p = 0.01), and improvements were found for WOMAC pain (p = 0.03), WOMAC physical function (p = 0.03), and objectively-measured physical function (p &lt; .001). Between Weeks 12 and 18, when participants were instructed to increase their daily steps by 6000 from baseline, physical activity minutes increased (p &lt; .001), and further improvements were found for objectively-measured physical function (p &lt; .001). During the follow up between Week 18 and 24, physical activity minutes decreased (p = 0.01) while objectively-measured physical function improved (p &lt; .001). Both studies add to the body of literature on the management of OA of the hip and knee. Study 1 provides information about OA sufferers&#8217; use of over-the-counter medications and their adoption of self-management strategies, information not routinely available from other sources, while Study 2 provides preliminary evidence for the walking &#8216;dose&#8217; appropriate to relieve OA symptoms and on the effects of difference &#8216;doses&#8217; on OA symptoms.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Osteoarthritis</field><field name="subject">Physical activity</field><field name="subject">*Exercise</field><field name="subject">Walking</field><field name="subject">Glucosamine Sulfate/ sulphate</field><field name="subject">arthritis</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:165418</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of CA125 in ovarian cancer biology</field><field name="creator">Ryan Parlett</field><field name="description">The cancer antigen 125 (CA125) is a cell-surface mucin which is over-expressed by the majority of ovarian cancers. However, its biology and the role it plays in ovarian cancer is largely unknown, although other cell-surface mucins have been shown to play a role in apoptosis, cell growth and tumour immune evasion. To analyse the function of CA125 in ovarian cancer, we initially knocked down the expression of CA125 using RNA interference. Knocking down CA125 expression using in vitro transcribed short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) induced a potent cell death response, which has been well characterised in the literature as an induction of an interferon response and resulting in cell apoptosis. Subsequently, using the short hairpin RNA expression vector, pSUPER, which has been shown to knock down genes with high efficiency with reduced off-target affects, we generated stable sub-lines of the ovarian cancer cell line, OVCAR-3, which had been transfected with pSUPER constructs targeting CA125. Intriguingly, these sub-lines had a range of abnormal mitotic events and nuclear defects. However, there was no clear association with the level of CA125 knock down. This could be either due to clonal selection from the parent OVCAR-3 cell line or in addition to CA125 knock down, additional genetic changes are required to occur to favour a state of survival. Similar to the in vitro data, xenografts of the sub-clones into SCID mice generated inconclusive results as to whether CA125 knock down contributes to tumour growth, invasion and metastasis in vivo. More recently, we have been able to achieve high levels of short-term CA125 knock down using synthetic siRNAs designed to reduce off-target affects. These preliminary in vitro and in vivo experiments conducted with pSUPER sub-lines should be repeated using synthetic siRNAs to confirm the role of CA125 in this context. Given the role which the cytoplasmic tail of cell-surface mucins plays in its function, we generated a polyclonal antibody recognising the CA125 cytoplasmic tail, designated M16.1. Immunofluorescence imaging of CA125 in ovarian cancer cell lines, OVCAR-3 and PEO-1, using the OC125 extracellular domain antibody indicated cell-surface localisaton of CA125. However, in addition to the cell-surface localisation, the M16.1 antibody localised to the cell cytoplasm, indicating cleavage and release of the CA125 cytoplasmic tail into the cytosol. Additionally, M16.1 co-localised with &#945;-tubulin at perinuclear sites and to areas resembling microtubule organising centres. However, M16.1 did not co-localise with &#947;-tubulin at the centrosome, indicating association with non-centrosomal microtubules. Furthermore, depolymerisation of microtubules on ice for 1 hour resulted in loss of diffuse cytoplasmic M16.1 staining but co-localisation between M16.1 and &#945;-tubulin at non-centrosomal sites remained. Intriguingly, when microtubules were allowed to reform at 37oC in PEO-1 cells which had CA125 knocked down by synthetic siRNAs, the ability to reform radial asters was impaired, possibly indicating the CA125 cytoplasmic tail involvement in anchoring microtubules to non-centrosomal sites. Furthermore, we also cloned a portion of CA125 encompassing the cytoplasmic tail, transmembrane domain and 9 tandem repeats. When this construct was transfected into COS-1 cells, the CA125 cytoplasmic tail localised to microtubule bundles during metaphase. Mitotic involvement of the endogenous CA125 cytoplasmic tail was confrmed in OVCAR-3 and PEO-1 cells using M16.1. Given this association and also the results from the pSUPER sub-lines with CA125 knockdown, CA125 may be involved in controlling the fidelity of mitosis, which is grossly altered during tumourigenesis. More recently, it was identified that galectin-1 (Gal-1), an S-type lectin, is a ligand for CA125. Gal-1 is a potent inducer of T cell apoptosis and has been implicated as playing a major role in immune evasion for cancer cells. Consequently, we analysed the expression of CA125 and Gal-1 in ovarian cancer and confirmed the two molecules were expressed concurrently at the mRNA level by RT-PCR. Moreover, immunofluorescence studies also confirmed that CA125 and Gal-1 interacted with each other at the cell-surface of 27/87 cells, an ovarian cancer cell-line. Therefore, we hypothesised that CA125 presents Gal-1 to the immune system, which then induces T cell apoptosis and allows the tumour to escape the immune system. However, CA125 did not protect tumour cells from recognition or killing by T cells, which was shown by no differences in IFN-&#947; secretion or tumour lysis by cytotoxic T cells using influenza peptide pulsed pSUPER sub-lines with CA125 knockdown. The work described in this thesis suggests that CA125 plays a major role in the aetiology and progression of ovarian cancer through its actions on mitosis, microtubule organisation and immune evasion.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mucins</field><field name="subject">Ca125</field><field name="subject">muc16</field><field name="subject">Ovarian Cancer</field><field name="subject">Microtubules</field><field name="subject">Mitosis</field><field name="subject">Immune Evasion</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:165420</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lowland rain forests of the tropical South Pacific: diversity, ecology and evolution</field><field name="creator">Gunnar Keppel</field><field name="description">The islands of the tropical South Pacific (TSP) are considered biodiversity hotspots. However, the biota of this region has received limited scientific attention and very little is known about its diversity, ecology and evolution. In this thesis we investigate some of the ecological and evolutionary processes in the TSP, focussing on lowland rain forests. We use molecular techniques to investigate evolutionary processes and vegetation surveys to study species diversity patterns and ecological processes. Chapter 1 reviews molecular, distributional and geographic evidence for dispersal versus vicariance explanations for the diversity and distribution of the TSP biota. Most islands of the TSP are geologically young (less than 40 million years old) and of oceanic origin, so most (if not all) of the biota on islands in the TSP arrived through long-distance dispersal events. This view is strongly corroborated by genetic data from published studies. Molecular studies also suggest two major source areas. One is located in the northwest, which includes Malesia and Southeast Asia, while the other is in the southwest and includes New Caledonia, Australia and New Zealand. We argue that local extinctions have occurred in source and stepping stone areas, creating sources of error for the interpretation of distribution and molecular data. In Chapter 2 we use allozyme data to investigate the question how Pacific cycads (Cycas, subsection Rumphiae) colonised the Pacific. We show that they colonised the Pacific and East Africa by long-distance dispersal, probably through floating seeds from a Malesian source area. Allozymes and morphological data provide support for two major groups within subsection Rumphiae and reveal close relationships between the extant species, suggesting very recent and/or ongoing dispersal events. Cycads are an example of recent diversification in a lineage with a long fossil record. The podocarp genus Dacrydium is another lineage with a long fossil record and in chapter 3 we investigate the colonisation and speciation processes in this lineage using allozymes and trnL-trnF plastid sequences. Our results suggest that the Pacific species of Dacrydium arrived recently (within the last 10 million years) in the TSP but are inconclusive about the source area of the genus. Combined molecular and ecological data suggest the occurrence of both allopatric and sympatric speciation in the Pacific radiation in this genus. Allozyme data also demonstrate the occurrence of hybridisation between two New Caledonian species. Our findings suggest that hybridisation and sympatric speciation may have played an important role in the evolution of the biota in the TSP. In chapter 4 we attempt to untangle the disparate forces driving alpha species diversity, forest structure and species composition in old-growth lowland tropical rainforest by assessing the tree species composition of twelve 1 ha vegetation count plots on 13 islands between New Guinea and Samoa. Using simplifications of a model based on biogeographic and ecological disturbance theory, we show that species diversity and richness are mainly influenced by size and area of an island, while endemism is mostly determined by isolation and area. High cyclone frequency is shown to increase the density of stems (with dbh &gt; 10 cm). Correlations between the abundance of widespread canopy tree taxa and cyclone frequency suggest that cyclones affect species composition by increasing the abundance of cyclone-resistant species. However, floristic similarities show that geographic distance also affects species composition. It therefore appears that, for lowland rain forests in the TSP, biogeography is the major driver of species diversity and endemism and that disturbance is the major driver of forest structure, while both biogeography and disturbance affect the species composition. In chapter 5 we test the ability of NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index, a remotely sensed index of productivity) data and leaf samples as covariates of alpha species diversity using twelve vegetation count plots. NDVI performed poorly in estimating species diversity and species richness. However, the cost- and time-efficiency associated with remotely sensed data shows the potential of these methods, but only if accurate methods to estimate species richness are found. Species richness and species diversity estimates obtained from leaf litter samples correlate reasonably well with similar estimates obtained from count plots and are more than 30% cheaper and about 10% faster to obtain. If travel can be avoided through collaboration, leaf litter-based estimates of diversity could be obtained at about 5% the cost and in about half the time compared to count plots. Therefore the analysis of leaf litter is potentially a suitable and efficient method to obtain rapid estimates of species diversity in count plots. The final chapter discusses the roles of ecological and evolutionary processes in the TSP. While research to date has been scarce, especially on ecological processes acting on large scales, data show that the effects of ecology, evolution and biogeography are interlinked during the colonisation, establishment and subsequent evolution of taxa and biomes in the TSP.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cycas</field><field name="subject">Dacrydium</field><field name="subject">cyclones</field><field name="subject">island biogeography</field><field name="subject">lowland rain forest</field><field name="subject">South Pacific</field><field name="subject">speciation</field><field name="subject">species diversity</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:165422</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reappraisal of geophysical phenomena and associated portents in the classical world</field><field name="creator">Maxwell Miller</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT Many unusual phenomena in nature were recorded from the regions bordering the Mediterranean Sea from the second millennium BC up to AD 600. The ancient sources interpreted these as prodigies, messages from the gods, but rarely discussed their causes. Numerous reports of these portents were viewed as the illusions of eyewitnesses or the fabrications of ancient literary sources. Many modern authors have interpreted these portents as fabulous, or as astronomical or meteorological events. This thesis examines the portents that occur in the atmosphere, biosphere, lithosphere and hydrosphere and proposes that many are geophysical phenomena caused by tectonic activity, in particular earthquakes and volcanoes. Modern research on these incidents is examined to identify characteristics and causes, and texts from ancient philosophers and natural historians are investigated to see whether they were aware of these natural occurrences and if so, how they were produced. Portents that possess the characteristics of seismically-induced lights, cloud, fog, storms, anomalous animal behaviour, noises, and hydrological changes are collated in order to discuss individual events. Where possible, ancient examples are compared with modern well-documented episodes with the same features. In a majority of cases, these events have recurred in the same locations at later times. The proposal that many of these phenomena are caused by seismic activity offers an alternative to the suggestions of many modern scholars, who ascribe many of the luminous events to lightning, meteors or comets and some sonics to exploding meteors or thunderstorms. This reappraisal of the ancient portents vindicates the seemingly fantastic reports that occur in the ancient texts, especially some of the poetic or religious sources, and rehabilitates the reputation of the authors who have documented these events. In the process it also adds to the catalogue of geophysical phenomena caused by earthquakes in the classical world.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">acoustic emissions, animal behaviour, earthquakes, earthquake lights, earthquake precursors, Ischia, portents, prodigies, volcanoes</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:165423</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bioactivity Grafting of Cyclic Peptides: Structure Activity Studies of Grafted Cyclotides and SFTI-1</field><field name="creator">Sunithi Gunasekera</field><field name="description">Peptides are considered as drugs of the future because of their advantageous features of high specificity and low toxicity. However, the complete therapeutic potential of peptides has not yet been realized because of the in vivo instability displayed by most potential peptides. In this thesis, two naturally derived cyclic peptides, cyclotides and sunflower trypsin inhibitor 1 (SFTI-1), were utilized to impart stability to linear bioactive epitopes and enhance their therapeutic potential in a biological environment. Cyclotides are plant derived mini-proteins with compact folded structures and exceptional stability. Their stability derives from a head-to-tail cyclised backbone coupled with a cystine knot arrangement of three-conserved disulfide bonds. Sunflower typsin inhibitor 1 (SFTI-1) is a stable cyclic peptide containing a single disulfide bond. Taking advantage of these stable cyclic peptide frameworks, novel drug leads to inhibit/stimulate angiogenesis were developed by using the approach of &#8216;epitope grafting&#8217; in which linear epitopes were grafted onto the cyclic peptide frameworks. Angiogenesis is a physiological condition that is unregulated in the progression of many diseases, including cancers and cardiovascular diseases. Thus the drug leads designed in the current project have potential therapeutic applications to combat cancers and cardiovascular diseases. To fully exploit cyclotides as drug scaffolds, it is imperative to understand their folding. Two main subfamilies, referred to as the M&#246;bius and bracelet cyclotides have been identified and interestingly, they require dramatically different in vitro folding conditions to achieve formation of the conserved cyclic cystine knot motif. To determine the underlying structural elements that influence cyclotide folding, the in vitro folding of a suite of hybrid cyclotides based on combination of the M&#246;bius cyclotide kalata B1 and the bracelet cyclotide cycloviolacin O1 was examined in this thesis. The pathways of folding of the two cyclotide subfamilies were found to be different and primarily dictated by specific residues harboured within inter-cysteine loops 2 and 6. Two changes in these loops, an amino acid substitution in loop 2 and an amino acid addition in loop 6 enabled the folding of cycloviolacin O1 under conditions where folding does not occur in vitro for the native peptide. Thus, the study identified key residues that are not in close proximity in the primary sequence or three-dimensional structure which assist folding in cyclotides. A key intermediate species in the folding pathway was isolated and characterised, and found to contain a native-like hairpin structure that appears to be a nucleation locus early in the folding process. The intermediate does not have native disulfide connectivities, but disulfide shuffling processes ultimately lead to a rearrangement to the native form. Overall these mechanistic findings on the folding of cyclotides are potentially valuable for protein engineering applications that utilize cystine-rich peptides as scaffolds in the design of new drug leads. The current study has also enabled the extention of the grafting studies to the bracelet cyclotide subfamily, which was intractable to grafting prior to this work. Cyclotides are gene encoded macrocyclic proteins and another way to exploit their potential as drug scaffolds, would be to develop combinatorial cyclotide libraries. The most efficient way to generate engineered cyclotides would be via recombinant expression, which currently remains unsuccessful, partly due to lack of understanding of the mechanism of cyclotide backbone cyclization. Understanding how the cyclotide precursor folds may provide clues to how cyliclization occurs. A conserved region known as the N-terminal repeat (NTR) region in the cyclotide precursor has been speculated to play an important role in precursor folding. In this thesis, the function of the NTR in the folding of the cyclotide precursor in vitro was examined via the design of a series of constructs for the precursor protein for the prototypic kalata B1 cyclotide, with incremental additions of the NTR region. Analysis of the constructs by NMR spectroscopy for evidence of secondary structure revealed that the NTR does not assist folding of the cyclotide precursor in vitro. Using diffusion NMR, the unstructured nature of the constructs was localized to the NTR region. In a complementary study, structural analysis of the full length cyclotide precursor was carried out by expressing the precursor gene for kalata B1 in a bacterial expression system. The full-length precursor was found to be unstructured in solution despite approximately half of the precursor comprising the mature domain and NTR, both of which are structured in isolation. The unstructured nature of the cyclotide precursor suggested that a different environment, or indeed interaction of the NTR with a particular enzyme involved in processing, is necessary for it to adopt a well-defined conformation and allow processing to produce the mature circular protein. The information that NTR alone may not assist folding of the cyclotide precursors has provided new impetus to examine the role of other potential folding auxiliaries such as protein disulfide isomerase in cyclotide folding and has indirectly advanced the production of cyclotides via transgenic means. In summary, this thesis has provided a fundamental insight into the folding of cyclotides, both when expressed as part of a precursor protein and in isolation via solid phase chemical synthesis, and has exploited the potential of cyclic peptide scaffolds in drug design applications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Cyclotides</field><field name="subject">NMR</field><field name="subject">Grafting</field><field name="subject">Peptides</field><field name="subject">Drug design</field><field name="subject">Folding</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:165426</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of activated remodelling in the healing of experimental stress fractures and the influence of anti-inflammatory treatments</field><field name="creator">Lisa Kidd</field><field name="description">Investigation of activated remodelling in the healing of experimental stress fractures and the influence of anti-inflammatory treatments Lisa Jane Kidd Abstract Targeted and focal remodelling are important processes in bone homeostasis and pathology. However, the factors that initiate and direct remodelling to repair microcracks, or respond to excess loading are still poorly understood. The rat ulna-loading (RUL) model has been widely used to examine modelling and remodelling responses to axial cyclic loading. However the model has not yet been fully characterised. Stress fractures are common amongst athletes, dancers and military recruits, but there is almost no information available on the mechanism of healing of these fractures. Although cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a key mediator of bone resorption and bone formation, very little information is available on the effect of non-steroidal antiinflammatories (NSAIDs) on stress fracture healing. Remodelling may play a role in the pathogenesis of stress fractures, and there is growing interest in the potential use of bisphosphonates to prevent them. Nonetheless, the effect of bisphosphonates on stress fracture healing is not known. PMX53 is a C5a receptor antagonist developed as a novel anti-inflammatory agent. It is effective against inflammatory arthritis, but has not been tested in any fracture models. The aims of this study were to undertake a detailed examination of the histology, histomorphometry and gene expression of the healing and remodelling process initiated by RUL, and to use this model to determine the effects of selective and non-selective NSAIDs, a bisphosphonate and PMX53 on stress fracture healing. To characterise the RUL model, fatigue fractures were created by loading ulnae until displacement was observed to increase by between 4% and 50%. Ulnae were bulk-stained in basic fuchsin and processed for undecalcified histology. For all remaining experiments, loading was stopped when the displacement had increased by 10%. For detailed histology and histomorphometry, ulnae were decalcified, paraffin embedded and stained with toluidine blue, saffranin-O or for tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). Ulnae were examined at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks after loading. The effects of DFU (a selective COX-2 inhibitor, 2 mg/kg po), ibuprofen (a non-selective NSAID, 30 mg/kg po) and PMX53 (10 mg/kg po) were examined at 2, 4 and 6 weeks after loading. Effects of risedronate (a bisphosphonate) were examined at a high (1.0 mg/kg po) and low dose (0.1 mg/kg po) at 2, 6 and 10 weeks after loading. RUL did not create isolated intracortical microcracks, but curvilinear fatigue fractures that occurred at a standard position in the medial cortex of the distal ulna diaphysis. These stress fractures induced rapid periosteal woven bone formation and direct intracortical remodelling along the fracture line that originated at the periosteum and progressed towards the medullary cavity. Basic multicellular units (BMUs) could be followed through serial sections extending along the fracture line towards the centre of the bone. Quantitative, real-time PCR was performed at 4 hours, 24 hours, 4 days, 7 days and 14 days after fatigue fracture. Following each period, bones were dissected and mRNA was extracted using standard protocols. Gene expression was compared between loaded and unloaded ulnae and to an unloaded control group. Four hours after loading, there was a marked, 220-fold increase (P&lt;0.0001) in expression of Interleukin-6 (IL-6). There were also prominent peak increases in mRNA expression for Osteoprotegerin (OPG), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (all P&lt;0.0001). At 24 hours there was a peak increase in mRNA expression for IL-11 (73-fold increase, P&lt;0.0001). At 4 days there was a significant increase in mRNA expression for Bcl-2, COX-1, bone morphogenic protein (BMP)-2, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, osteopontin (OPN), and stromal cell derived factor SDF-1. At 7 days there was a significant increase in mRNA expression of Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa &#946; ligand (RANKL) and OPN. The dramatic, early up-regulation of IL-6 and IL-11 suggests they play a central role in initiating signalling events for stress fracture healing. Treatment with PMX53 did not affect any measures of woven bone formation or stress fracture remodelling. There were no treatment effects of Ibuprofen or DFU on the area of woven bone. DFU treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the area of porosity (resorption) and BMU area along the fracture line at 2 weeks after fracture. Ibuprofen treatment resulted in a significant reduction in length and area of BMUs and new bone formation along the fracture line at 6 weeks (p &lt; 0.05). This is the first report to demonstrate a negative effect on stress fracture healing of both a selective COX-2 inhibitor and a non-selective NSAID. These data confirm the importance of cyclooxygenase in bone resorption and formation during remodelling. Bisphosphonates are potent inhibitors of osteoclastic bone resorption Two, 6 and 10 weeks after loading, measures of resorption and new bone formation were significantly reduced along the fracture line by high dose risedronate treatment, but not by the low dose. Only the porosity along the fracture line 2 weeks after loading was significantly reduced by the low dose risedronate. The low dose more closely resembles the clinical dose used to treat patients. Woven bone formation and consolidation were not affected by the low or high doses of risedronate. In conclusion, fatigue fractures in the rat ulna are highly reproducible, induce exuberant periosteal woven bone formation, and heal by direct remodelling along the fracture line. Remodelling is associated with gene expression for molecules typically associated with bone resorption and formation, angiogenesis and cell signalling. Remodelling of the stress fracture line was adversely affected by treatment with selective and non-selective COX inhibitors, by high dose treatment with risedronate, but not by PMX53, a C5a antagonist.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cyclooxygenase</field><field name="subject">anti-inflammatory</field><field name="subject">microdamage</field><field name="subject">stress fractures</field><field name="subject">bone</field><field name="subject">rat-ulna-loading</field><field name="subject">Bone Remodelling</field><field name="subject">ibuprofen</field><field name="subject">bisphosphonate</field><field name="subject">C5a</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:165429</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of the immunopathology associated with cerebral malaria</field><field name="creator">Louise Randall</field><field name="description">Cerebral malaria (CM) is a severe complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection, predominantly experienced by children in sub-Saharan Africa. Patients with CM are comatose and often convulse, develop retinal haemorrhages and motor abnormalities. Recent histological studies on brain tissue obtained from patients who have died from CM have identified heterogeneity in brain pathology. As a result, CM is considered to be a complex disease that may be comprised of a number of syndromes. Patients admitted to hospital with CM are treated with anti-malaria drugs; however, even in the best equipped hospitals, a large number of CM patients die within the first 24-hours following hospital admission before the anti-malarial treatment can have an effect. For this reason, it is critical that the mechanisms leading to CM are elucidated in order to develop effective adjunct therapies. Experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) caused by P. berghei ANKA (PbA) infection of susceptible mice displays many features of human CM. A key feature of this model is the pivotal role of the host immune response in pathogenesis, particularly the involvement of T cells. Evidence, predominantly from ECM studies, suggests that tumour necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily (TNFSF) members play critical roles in the immunopathology associated with CM. The first hypothesis investigated in this thesis was that key immune response pathways contribute to the development of CM and, despite the heterogeneity observed between CM patients, common pathways exist that may be targeted to prevent CM. The second hypothesis tested was that members of the TNF superfamily modulate the immune response to infection and are involved in the development of pathology observed in severe malaria (SM). In order to investigate the above hypotheses, three projects were carried out. First, we examined the great heterogeneity in brain expression profiles between ECM-susceptible CBA/CaH (CBA) and C57BL/6 (B6) mice at the peak of disease, as well as the significant differences in circulating cytokine expression and expansion of microglia in brain tissue. We found that, despite these differences, common therapeutic and preventative strategies existed to disrupt the development of ECM in the two ECM-susceptible mouse strains. Second, studies in ECM mice have identified T cells and TNFSF members, TNF and lymphotoxin (LT)-a, as critical mediators of ECM pathology. We extend these studies to examine the role of the TNFSF member LIGHT in ECM. Specific blockade of LIGHT signalling through its receptor, LT&#946;R, in PbA-infected B6 mice abrogated the hallmark features of ECM brain pathology and improved the control of parasite growth. Importantly, specific blockade of LIGHT-LT&#946;R signalling caused the expansion of splenic monocytes and an overall enhanced capacity to remove and process antigen during infection. Together, this study discovered a novel pathogenic role for LIGHT and LT&#946;R in ECM and identified this TNF family receptor-ligand interaction as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in SM. Finally, we investigated the role of LTa in human SM and, more specifically, CM. We tested whether the polymorphisms within the gene encoding LTa (LTA) were associated with susceptibility to SM in Papuan Highland children and adults who had migrated from an area without malaria pressure to a region where malaria is endemic. Despite a lack of association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the LTA/TNF locus and susceptibility to SM in Papuan Highland children and adults, we found a significant association between a SNP in the LTa-related gene encoding galactin-2 (LGALS2) and susceptibility to CM in children, but not adults in this study population. Interestingly, no association was found between this SNP and susceptibility to CM in Tanzanian children originating from and living in a malaria endemic region. These results suggest that there may be differences in the mechanisms leading to CM in adults and children, as well as between individuals from malaria endemic and non-endemic areas. Together, the findings outlined in this thesis are important to both the understanding of the underlying mechanisms leading to CM and to the development of improved interventions and adjunct therapies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plasmodium</field><field name="subject">cerebral malaria</field><field name="subject">Immunopathology</field><field name="subject">Lymphotoxin-alpha</field><field name="subject">Tumour Necrosis Factor</field><field name="subject">susceptibility</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:165456</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of manufacturing factors on stirred yogurt properties</field><field name="creator">Kanokkan Weeragul</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT Stirred yogurt is a cultured dairy product produced by mixed cultures of lactic acid bacteria. It is a semi-viscous liquid whose rheological properties are major quality determinants. These are influenced by several manufacturing factors such as heat treatment of the yogurt milk. Improvement of the properties of stirred yogurt made under different manufacturing conditions was the key focus in this research. The research included an investigation of the key factors involved in the development of nodulation which is an unsightly defect, as consumers expect stirred yogurt to have a smooth consistency. This research consisted of three main experimental parts: 1. Effect of different heat treatments on the properties of stirred yogurt; 2. Factors involved in nodulation in stirred yogurt; and 3. The physical and chemical nature of nodules. The types and levels of heat treatment have a major influence on the properties of stirred yogurt. In this study, yogurt milk was treated at pasteurization and UHT conditions. The milk heated at pasteurization, 80-95oC, and UHT, 130-145oC, conditions had similar levels of whey protein denaturation, approximately 85-99%, while the milk treated at low temperature for a long time, 65oC for 4 hr, had a significantly lower level of denaturation (~55%). Yogurt made from milk pasteurized at 85oC for 30 min and 92oC for 7 min and UHT treated milk at 130-145oC for 5 s had similar hardness and viscosity while yogurt made from milk treated at 65oC for 4 hr had significantly lower hardness and viscosity than corresponding yogurts from high heat treatments. In addition, the water-holding capacity and syneresis of yogurts made from either pasteurized or UHT milk were not significantly different. Yogurt (made from either pasteurized or UHT-treated milk) enriched with non-dairy ingredients, gelatin, inulin and sugar, showed higher hardness, viscosity, water-holding capacity than yogurt made with only dairy ingredients. These yogurts also showed no syneresis. This can be largely attributed to the gelatin which improves the texture, binds additional water and prevents syneresis. The formation of nodules in yogurt has been reported to be influenced by several factors. In this study, the heat treatment of the yogurt milk, the types and levels of sugar added, and the type of starter cultures were found to significantly influence the level of nodulation in the stirred yogurts. Severe pasteurization heat treatments, at temperatures &lt; 100&#186;C, caused more nodules than mild heat treatments at temperatures in this range. The type of heat treatment was also important, with yogurt made from UHT-treated milk showing much less nodulation than yogurt made from pasteurized. This was observed when the levels of whey protein denaturation in the pasteurized and UHT milk were similar, indicating that the extent of whey protein denaturation alone is not a major factor in the development of nodules. Sucrose added either before or after heat treatment of yogurt milk also affected the extent of nodulation. Increasing the amount of added sucrose from 0 to 6.5% caused correspondingly higher numbers of nodules. In addition, there was a positive synergistic effect between heat treatment and sugar addition on nodulation; the highest numbers of nodules appeared when the yogurt milk was severely heated and sugar was added at the highest level, 6.5%. Addition of lactose or fructose instead of sucrose did not promote nodule formation while glucose caused nodulation in a similar manner to sucrose. The use of different starter cultures affected the numbers of nodules; yogurts made with the culture ABT 10 had much less nodulation than those made with ABT5 and ABT6, even under heating conditions and sugar addition conducive to nodule development. The amount of exopolysaccharide (EPS) produced by the starter cultures, ABT5 and ABT10, did not correlate with the extent of nodulation in the yogurt. Disturbance during yogurt fermentation by changing the temperature (from 37 to 42 or 45 to 42oC) when the gel was forming increased the numbers of nodules while refrigerated storage of yogurt and altering the pH during heat treatment (from pH 6.46 to 6.90) did not affect the number of nodules. Ultrasonication of the yogurt milk caused a reduction in the numbers of nodules in the yogurt. This was attributed to disruption of clumps of starter culture bacteria, thus preventing excessive localised build-up of acid around the bacterial clumps which could form the nucleus of nodules. The major conclusions from this study are that heat treatment of the yogurt milk and the level and type of added sugar are important factors affecting the extent of nodulation of stirred yogurt. Other factors such as the type of starter culture bacteria and their degree of clumping are also significant. Optimisation of these factors would allow yogurt manufacturers to minimise nodulation in stirred yogurt.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stirred yogurt</field><field name="subject">nodulation</field><field name="subject">heat treatment</field><field name="subject">texture</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:165674</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What Sponsors Really Want: An Investigation of Sponsorship Decision-making and Choice</field><field name="creator">Margaret Johnston</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT Much is known about the process of sponsorship selection with respect to the key personnel involved in the buying decision and also about the strategic objectives for sponsorship. However, few investigations have focused on how sponsors assess the relative value of different sponsorship activities. This research project examined sponsorship decision-making with reference to the way managers discuss, think, and act when evaluating a sponsorship property for the first time. It focuses in particular on understanding how sponsors make decisions when selecting a new activity; how perceptions of risk influence their choice behaviours; the relative value they attribute to different sponsorship features; and how individual factors influence their choice of sponsorship domain. This research program considered these issues from three dimensions (1) linguistically (i.e. how firms publicly describe and explain their sponsorship selection procedures to others); (2) cognitively (i.e. how sponsorship experts describe and rationalise the decision process); and (3) conatively (i.e. how sponsorship managers report they behave when making sponsorship selection decisions). First, Study 1 explored the linguistic dimension of sponsorship selection through a content analysis of the sponsorship policies and guidelines of 298 global, national and local firms. The content analysis of these documents was conducted using Leximancer text analysis software. The analysis revealed six attributes were particularly important. These were the cost of sponsorship rights fees; the capacity of the sponsorship to achieve brand marketing objectives; the opportunities for brand exposure; the sharing of values between partners; the type/domain of the sponsorship activity; and its geographic reach. Firms avoided activities likely to damage their corporate or brand image by alienating sections of the community or by violating social norms. Next, Study 2 explored the cognitive dimension of sponsorship through a series of in-depth interviews with 16 sponsors and 20 properties. Interviews revealed that while practitioners supported the importance of attributes similar to those identified in Study 1, they placed more emphasis on the duration of the sponsorship agreement, the partner&#8217;s reputation and sponsorship management ability, and on the level of involvement, and less emphasis on shared values and geographic reach. Risk assessment was implicit in their due diligence practices. Risk mitigation strategies included risk avoidance, risk reduction, risk retention, and risk transfer. Study 3 examined the conative dimension of the sponsorship selection process using a full-profile choice-based conjoint (CBC) experiment completed by 196 sponsorship managers. The respondents evaluated 17 sets of fully-randomised fictitious sponsorship proposals constructed using the attributes identified in the previous two studies. Hierarchical Bayes (HB) analysis showed that the degree of fit with brand objectives, the duration of the sponsorship, and the perceived quality of the partner relationship exerted the strongest influence on sponsor preferences. Specifically, sponsors placed the highest value on sponsorships that offered a very high fit with their brand objectives, a one-year agreement, a good partner relationship, were cause-related, had a State-wide reach, involved a title sponsorship, a combination of cash and in-kind payment, and offered print media exposure. Finally, to examine the influence of individual factors (i.e. gender, the level of decision-making authority, and experience in decision-making) on the choice of sponsorship domain (i.e. sport sponsorship, arts sponsorship, cause-related sponsorship, and celebrity endorsement), three sponsorship simulations were conducted as part of Study 3 using Share of Preference modelling. The results showed that cause-related sponsorship was the most strongly preferred domain in each of the three models, whereas celebrity endorsement was the least preferred. While female managers were indifferent to arts or sport sponsorship, male managers showed a strong preference for sport sponsorship over arts sponsorship. Managers were less interested in sport sponsorship than more senior executives. The preferences of managers with the least experience were consistent with those of highly-experienced sponsors. However, managers with 11-15 years experience showed much less interest in sport sponsorship than others. Conceptually, this program of research allowed for the development of a decision-making model that provides the basis for future investigations of sponsorship value. For the practitioner, the results of this research support previous findings about the significance of sponsorship activities having a good fit with the sponsor&#8217;s brand objectives. As well, properties with a good reputation for building high-quality sponsorship relationships will find favour with new sponsors.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sponsorship</field><field name="subject">decision-making</field><field name="subject">Leximancer</field><field name="subject">conjoint analysis</field><field name="subject">hierarchical Bayes</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:165730</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation and Functional Analysis of Osteal Macrophages: Resident Tissue Macrophages are Intercalated throughout Mouse Bone Lining Tissues and Regulate Osteoblast Function In Vitro</field><field name="creator">Ming-Kang Chang</field><field name="description">Resident tissue macrophages are an integral component of many tissues and are important in development, homeostasis and repair. Macrophages are present at sites of both pathologic bone deposition and loss, and can produce osteo-active factors. These observations link macrophages to bone disease, however their contribution to bone dynamics is poorly understood. The molecular and cellular mechanisms driving osteoblast differentiation, matrix deposition and mineralization in vivo are incompletely understood and this deficiency is translated to limited ability to clinically manipulate bone formation. The emerging understanding of the bi-directional interactions between the osseus and immune systems (osteoimmunology) provides a novel avenue to identify mechanisms involved in the regulation of bone formation. In this study, the presence and distribution of macrophages on bone surfaces was systematically analysed and their functional contribution to the bone microenvironment was investigated. Using immunohistochemistry a discrete population of mature resident tissue macrophages was demonstrated throughout resting murine osteal tissues, termed OsteoMacs. Utilising MacGreen mice (csf1r promoter drives eGFP transgene expression in macrophages and other myeloid cells), it was demonstrated that OsteoMacs were intercalated amongst other bone lining cells in both the endosteum and periosteum. OsteoMacs were TRAPneg in situ and had limited osteoclastogenic ability in vitro therefore they are unlikely to serve as the immediate physiologic osteoclast precursors in vivo. Microarray gene expression profiling demonstrated that macrophage gene expression was regulated in response to a characteristic feature of the bone microenvironment, elevated extracellular calcium. Quantitative PCR validated upregulation of sphingosine kinase 1, interleukin 1 receptor antagonise, progressive ankylosis, vascular endothelial growth factor c and dipepetidase 2 mRNA in response to elevated extracellular calcium, suggesting the potential roles of these genes in this unique niche. GNF Symatlas microarray and quantitative PCR demonstrated the expression of macrophage-restricted genes throughout a 21-day primary osteoblast differentiation time course, suggesting co-isolation of OsteoMacs with primary osteoblasts. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed that over all 15.9% of the digested primary calvarial cell preparations were OsteoMacs. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated that OsteoMacs persisted and expanded in standard 21-day osteoblast differentiation assays. Contrary to previous studies, we demonstrated it was the OsteoMacs, and not osteoblasts, within calvarial preparations that selectively detected patho-physiological concentrations of the bacterial product lipopolysaccharide (LPS). A protocol was developed to deplete OsteoMacs from calvarial digests to determine if their presence within these cultures facilitates osteoblast differentiation or function. OsteoMac removal did not affect expression of the early osteoblast differentiation marker genes collagen type I or alkaline phosphatase. However, OsteoMac removal significantly decreased gene expression of the osteoblast mineralisation marker osteocalcin and mineralisation function, assessed by von Kossa staining. Microarray gene expression profiling demonstrated that osteoblast enrichment had a broad impact on transcription within the culture, identifying both candidate OsteoMac marker genes as well as osteoblast expressed genes that are regulated by OsteoMacs. Potential OsteoMac-enriched candidate genes insulin-like growth factor a, dipepetidase 2, glycoprotein NMB, and macrophage expressed gene 1 as well as osteoblast-specific genes bone sialoprotein and thrombospondin 1 were selected based on their potential involvement in osteoblast function. In a transwell co-culture system of enriched osteoblasts and macrophages, it was demonstrated that macrophages were required for osteoblast mineralisation in response to the physiologic remodelling stimulus, elevated extracellular calcium. A blocking soluble receptor strategy provided evidence that this is mediated in a BMP-2 and -4 independent manner. To investigate the relevance of OsteoMacs to bone formation in vivo, immunohistochemistry staining for the mature tissue macrophage marker F4/80 was performed in long bone sections from rapidly growing mice. OsteoMacs were closely associated with areas of bone formation in situ, forming a distinctive canopy structure over mature cuboidal osteoblasts (collagen type I+, osteocalcin+) on endosteal cortical surfaces. Using adapted histomorphometic analysis, we determined that 77 &#177; 2.1% (n = 7) of the endosteal mature osteoblast surface was covered by the F4/80+ OsteoMac canopy. This observation suggested that OsteoMacs are optimally located to regulate osteoblast function in vivo. In summary, we have demonstrated that OsteoMacs are an integral component of bone lining tissues and play a novel role in bone dynamics through regulating osteoblast function. These observations implicate OsteoMacs, in addition to osteoclasts and osteoblasts, as principal participants in bone dynamics. Further delineation of OsteoMac functions is likely to provide new avenues for treating bone disease and assisting bone repair.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">macrophage</field><field name="subject">osteoblast</field><field name="subject">bone</field><field name="subject">osteoclast</field><field name="subject">mineralisation</field><field name="subject">osteoimmunology</field><field name="subject">bone formation</field><field name="subject">osteomac</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:165763</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fundamental Studies on the Mechanisms and Kinetics of Nickel Oxide Reduction</field><field name="creator">Taufiq Hidayat</field><field name="description">Fundamental studies on the mechanisms and kinetics of reduction of dense synthetic nickel oxide have been carried out in H2-N2 and H2-H2O mixtures. The influences of temperature, hydrogen partial pressure, and hydrogen-steam ratio on the reduction process were systematically investigated. The kinetics of the reduction process were followed metallographically by measuring the advance of the nickel product layer. The microstructures of the reduction products and their changes during heating were characterized using a high resolution scanning electron microscopy. In H2-N2 mixtures and H2-H2O mixtures with low steam content, it was found that the initial reduction rates were first order with respect to hydrogen partial pressure. In both sets of mixtures, it was found that the progress of NiO reduction was not a monotonic function of temperature. A minimum rate of advancement of NiO reduction was observed in the temperature range 700oC &#8211; 800oC depending on the hydrogen partial pressures and reduction time. A number of distinctly different nickel product microstructures, originating at the Ni-NiO interface were observed under various reduction conditions, namely coarse fibrous nickel with fissures, fine porous nickel-planar interface, large porous nickel-irregular interface and dense nickel product layer. The microstructures of reduction product were found to change with temperature and time. It was found that heating the coarse fibrous nickel structure resulted in a re-crystallization, grain growth and densification of nickel product. When the heat treatments were carried out on the porous nickel structures, the number of pores decreases with increasing temperature and time, which was accompanied by the increase in the pore sizes. The microstructures and kinetics of the reduction of nickel oxide were found to be a function of temperature, gas composition and reaction time. The study provides strong evidence for a link between the reduction kinetics and the changes in the reduction product microstructures. Mechanisms and kinetics of the reduction of nickel oxide have been discussed by considering reduction conditions, information on the structures and elementary processes involving in the reduction process.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nickel Oxide</field><field name="subject">Microstructure Characterization</field><field name="subject">Reaction Kinetics</field><field name="subject">Gas-solid Reactions</field><field name="subject">Pyrometallurgy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:166135</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adults&#8217; Physically-Active Transport: A Population- and Destination-Based Perspective</field><field name="creator">Rachel Cole</field><field name="description">Increasing population levels of physical activity is a key public health priority in combating chronic non-communicable diseases. Epidemiological evidence for the health benefits of moderate-intensity physical activity has aroused interest in active transport, particularly walking. Social ecological models, and specifically policy and environmental approaches to increasing active transport are core elements of public health goals. There is currently limited walking for transport data in Australia that can be analysed using public health criteria. There is some evidence that socio-demographic differentials may exist. Investigations of the correlates of walking for transport suggest that residents of neighbourhoods with greater population densities, more land use mix, greater street connectivity and better walking and cycling infrastructure, tend to walk and cycle more. The studies in this Thesis start to address some aspects of these knowledge gaps by focussing on the social, personal and environmental correlates of adults&#8217; walking for transport. These studies aim to identify how active commuting and transport options might potentially be used to increase adult levels of health-enhancing physical activity, through increased walking. In doing so, it assists in increasing understanding about ways to link public health policy initiatives more strongly to the transport and urban-design fields, and to other sectors with an interest in active transport. The thesis begins with a literature review of the descriptive epidemiology and correlates of walking for transport. Chapter 2 is a secondary analysis of existing data from a statewide survey of adults. It reports socio-demographic variations in moderate to brisk paced walking for transport, and the contribution of walking for transport to health-enhancing physical activity, separately from walking for recreation. The results showed that rates of sufficient walking for transport using public health criteria (10% for men; 9% for women) were slightly less than those for walking for recreation or exercise (14% for both men and women). Few socio-demographic differences emerged in rates of walking for transport. Men aged over 60 years were significantly less likely to walk for transport. Walking contributed more toward meeting the current public-health guidelines among women (15% to 21%) than among men (6% to 8%). The Thesis then examines relevant issues associated with walking to two discrete destinations, within a defined local-community context. The first destination-type was primary schools (Chapter 3). In this study, the prevalence and duration of walking to and from school, together with perceived influences on doing so, were examined among parents of primary school children. Findings showed that, despite the overall low prevalence of walking to school by parents, health-enhancing benefits may be achieved, even when other modes of transport are used in conjunction with walking. Walking was a common (28%) mode of transport for journeys less than two kilometres. Eighteen percent of parents who travelled by modes other than walking also walked for at least 10 minutes. Significantly greater proportions of parents who walked for at least 10 minutes: had only one car in their household; had a child who attended a government school; did not have a driver&#8217;s licence; had 10 years or less of education; and, lived within two kilometres of the school. Factors perceived by parents as influencing walking to and from school were: being physically active; safety concerns for the child walking alone; not having to park; walking being the child&#8217;s preferred option; there being too much motor vehicle traffic; and, their child&#8217;s age and road sense. The second destination-type examined was tertiary education institutions (Chapter 4). In this study, associations of stages of motivational readiness for active transport with perceived barriers and incentives to walking to and from university among students were examined. Common barriers to walking were long travel distances, inconvenience and time constraints. Common incentives were shorter travel distance, having more time, supportive infrastructure and better security. Those not considering active commuting (pre-contemplators) were significantly more likely to report shorter travel distance as an incentive compared to those in the contemplation-preparation stage. Those in the contemplation-preparation stage were significantly more likely to report lack of motivation, inadequate infrastructure, shorter travel distance and inconvenience as barriers; and, having more time, supportive infrastructure, social support and incentive programs as enablers. Chapter 5 explores ways of linking public health policy initiatives with other sectors. Structured interviews with senior and middle level administrators from public, private and community groups were used to assess perceived barriers and enablers to active transport. Key themes emerged from the study relating to infrastructure delivery, public transport services, walk- and cycle-friendly community attributes, political leadership and government coordination, and societal travel norms and culture. There were also themes relating to limited resources and limited relevant technical expertise, institutional and practitioner cultures, and agencies not identifying with their roles in active transport. Broader intersectoral policies and cross-government initiatives were seen to hold promise, including economic incentives and built environment guidelines, campaigns targeting public attitudes and opinions, and community participation in policy-making. The findings from these studies and the implications for increasing physical activity through walking for transport are discussed in Chapter 6. These findings have potential to be used to inform intervention approaches, study initiatives and future research directions across key sectors for specific subgroups and particular destinations. Physical activity strategies and programs could feasibly be designed within community and organisational settings to increase adults&#8217; rates of participation in walking for transport.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">physical activity</field><field name="subject">active transport</field><field name="subject">walking</field><field name="subject">destinations</field><field name="subject">policy</field><field name="subject">adults</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:166406</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis of Well-Defined Polymer Nanoparticles</field><field name="creator">Carl Urbani</field><field name="description">The synthesis of well-defined polymer nanoparticles will have immediate applications in the biomedical industry as nanocontainers for the controlled delivery and release of water insoluble drugs. The ability to control molecular weight, particle morphology and chemical functionality and to obtain polymeric nanoparticles with narrow molecular weight and particle size distributions is paramount for their application-specific design. Two synthetic approaches were investigated in the synthesis of well-defined polymer nanoparticles, emulsion polymerization and self assembly. The successful implementation of Reversible Addition-Fragmentation Chain Transfer (RAFT) in emulsion polymerization was the first challenge faced when controlling nanoparticle molecular weight and size. Initially we showed that successful &#8216;living&#8217; emulsion polymerizations of styrene could be carried out using a non-ionic surfactant. The success was achieved when preparing polymers of low molecular weight (5 and 9 K targeted Mn&#8217;s with polydispersities (PDIs) below 1.2). Deviation from ideal &#8216;living&#8217; behavior occurred when targeting Mn&#8217;s greater than 20 K (at 100 % conversion). The &#8216;degassing technique&#8217; was then investigated as an avenue to generate stable polystyrene nanoparticles by emulsion polymerization without the addition of surfactant (residual surfactant can result in detrimental effects on product quality). The polymerization of this emulsion system in the presence of a low reactive RAFT agent was &#8216;living&#8217; in nature. In the presence of a high reactive RAFT agent the emulsion system showed &#8216;living&#8217; nature, however, secondary nucleation occurred, which resulted in broad molecular weight distribution (MWD). Thus, the emulsion polymerization approach to preparing well-defined polymer nanoparticles was giving less than desirable results. An alternative method to prepare polymer nanoparticles with controlled chemical composition and morphology is to self assemble pre-synthesized block copolymers in water. This approach has several significant advantages over the emulsion systems: (i) all polymer chains are of near uniform chain length and chemical composition, (ii) the ratio between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic polymers can easily be controlled, (iii) chemical functionality can be located in different morphological regions, (iv) a wide range of 3-dimensional structures apart from spheres can be prepared (i.e. rods and vesicles), and (v) additives such as surfactant, stabilizers and residual monomer usually found after an emulsion polymerization are not required in the self assembly methodology. These advantages justify our shift in strategy. The only disadvantage of the self assembly process is that one cannot reach high weight fractions of polymer in water and is usually limited to below 2 wt-%, where as emulsion polymerizations can allow weight fractions of polymer close to 50 wt-%. Well-defined amphiphilic 4-arm star polyacrylic acid-block-polystyrene (PAA-b-PSTY) copolymers, prepared by RAFT solution polymerization, were dispersed in water to form core-shell micelles, in which the shell consisted of tethered PAA loops. The entropic penalty for having such loops resulted in a less densely packed PSTY core when compared to linear diblock copolymers of the same arm length. The surface of the shell was irregular due to the tethering points, but when cleaved the PAA chains extended to form a regular and relatively uniform corona. Controlling the polymer architecture enabled the synthesis of polymer micelles with tethered PAA loops, which could be opened to form uniform corona when desired. Three-miktoarm star and dendrimers with miktoarms consisting of PSTY, polytert-butyl acrylate (PtBA), polymethyl acrylate (PMA) and PAA were then synthesized using a combination of Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP) and Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition &#8216;click&#8217; reactions. In all reactions, the stars and dendrimers were well-defined with PDIs lower than 1.09. This was the first step in the synthesis of well-defined highly ordered polymer structures. The synthesis of such structures demands high level of purity at each synthetic step eliminating the possibility of side reactions, which as of consequence lowers product yields. The synthesis and use of reactive solid supports to remove excess linear polymer to increase the yields of polymeric 3-arm stars and dendrimers was employed. These supports are a cheap approach to scavenge polymeric species with either azido or alkynyl functionality, after which the solid support can be filtered away from the product. These supports aided the synthesis of 3rd generation polymeric dendrons and dendrimers consisting of homopolymer PSTY with either solketals or alcohols at the periphery, diblock PSTY and PtBA, and amphiphilic diblock. The methodology used to construct these structures was a combination of ATRP to produce linear polymers with telechelic functionality, with the subsequent use of this functionality to join the polymers together via &#8216;click&#8217; reactions. Micellization of the amphiphilic structures in water produced polymer nanoparticles of uniform size. The dendrimer nanoparticles were 18 nm in diameter, consisting of 19 individual dendrimers. The dendrimers most probably have no mutual interpenetration and thus pack uniformly to form the micelles. The dendron nanoparticles were 21 nm with an aggregation number of 43 dendrons per micelle, which suggests they form cone-like structures and self-assemble to form crew-cut micelles. Using a convergent approach polymer structures with unprecedented chemical diversity (hydrophobic or amphiphilic) and complexity (G2 miktoarm dendrimers with a degradable core) consisting of PSTY, PMA, PtBA and PAA were then synthesized with high purity using copper wire as the &#8216;click&#8217; catalyst.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">polymer synthesis</field><field name="subject">nanoparticle</field><field name="subject">micelle</field><field name="subject">self assembly</field><field name="subject">emulsion polymerization</field><field name="subject">'living' radical</field><field name="subject">'click' chemistry</field><field name="subject">dendrimer</field><field name="subject">dendron</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:166443</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis and Design of Free-Space Optical Interconnects for Optically Augmented Computing</field><field name="creator">Mr Feng-chuan Tsai</field><field name="description">Performance requirements of short-distance digital communication links have increased considerably with the escalating demand for high speed and high density data links. The high aggregate bandwidth and channel density achievable by free-space optical interconnects (FSOIs) make them ideal replacement for electrical interconnection schemes. Optical interconnects potentially have low power consumption, and can facilitate the development of radically novel designs for VLSI architectures including heterogeneous multiprocessor systems, and highly parallel computing systems. Recent developments in the integration of Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Laser (VCSEL) arrays and photodetector arrays with CMOS electronic circuitry have increased the practical potential of optical interconnects. However, VCSELs tend to operate in several transverse modes simultaneously, which will degrade the performance of FSOIs. Experimental investigation was performed to evaluate the operation characteristics and the intensity noise in VCSELs. The measurement results were later combined with optical simulations to analyse the effect of optical crosstalk in free-space optical interconnects. The VCSEL characterization included light-current-voltage relationships, relative intensity noise, modal spectral composition and modal beam profiles. The optical system simulation software (Code V) was used to simulate optical crosstalks in the FSOI system. Experimentally measured spectrally-resolved near-field images of VCSEL higher order modes were used as extended sources in the proposed simulation model. The simulation was performed using a combination of exact ray-tracing and the beam propagation method. A new type of crosstalk referred to as the stray-light crosstalk (SLC) was introduced. This type of crosstalk is caused by the overfill of the transmitter microlens by the VCSEL beam. It was discovered that part of the signal was imaged by the adjacent microlens to another channel, possibly far from the intended one. The simulation showed that the SLC is strongly dependent on the fill factor of the microlens, array pitch, and the channel density of the system. When comparing the diffraction-caused crosstalk (DCC) to SLC, an increase in the interconnection distance has little influence on the SLC. A simple behavioural model was developed which accurately approximates the crosstalk noise for a range of optical sources and interconnect configurations. The effect of transmitter and receiver array configurations on the performance of FSOIs was investigated. Our results demonstrate the importance of SLC in both square and hexagonal configuration. By changing the array lattice geometry from square to a hexagonal, we obtained an overall optical signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement of 3 dB. The optical SNR is optimal for the hexagonal channel arrangement regardless of the transverse mode structure of the VCSEL beam was shown. Furthermore, the VCSEL drive current required for the best performance of the FSOI system was determined. The optimal focal length of the transmitter microlens array which maximises the SNR by minimising the combined effects of DCC and SLC was determined. Our results show that shorter focal length needs to be used for higher order modes to obtain optimal SNR in an FSOI system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="subject">optical interconnects</field><field name="subject">free-space optical interconnects</field><field name="subject">diffraction</field><field name="subject">optical crosstalk</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:166497</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heuristic algorithms for graph decomposition problems</field><field name="creator">Andriy Kvyatkovskyy</field><field name="description">The research presented in this thesis investigates the performance of some well-known heuristic algorithms on graph decomposition problems. First, a genetic algorithm is introduced and some modifications are trialled on finding Steiner triple systems (STS) of small orders. The results show that traditional genetic algorithms are not well suited to finding graph decompositions. Then a hill climbing optimisation technique is presented and investigated in the context of cycle decompositions. Such searches have previously proved to be effective at finding STSs. However, the general hill climbing approach is not immediately applicable to decompositions into cycles of length larger than 3. A modification of the hill climbing algorithm for cycles, called slippery hill climbing, is introduced and tested on decompositions of graphs into cycles of small lengths larger than 3. Slippery hill climbing successfully decomposed complete and dense non-complete graphs of considerable sizes into cycles of small lengths. In addition, we applied the slippery hill climbing approach to completing partial latin squares. It is reasonably expected that the algorithms developed in this study will also be applicable to other related problems in combinatorics and graph theory.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">230000 Mathematical Sciences</field><field name="subject">Graph Theory</field><field name="subject">cycle decompositions</field><field name="subject">Genetic Algorithms</field><field name="subject">hill climbing</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:166513</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Controlling emulsion and foam stability with stimuli-responsive peptide surfactants</field><field name="creator">Andrew Malcolm</field><field name="description">Emulsions and foams are thermodynamically unstable dispersions that will eventually succumb to coalescence, leading to phase separation. However the kinetic stability of emulsions and foams can vary from transiently stable systems with lifetimes of seconds to indefinitely stable systems with lifetimes of many years. Understanding and controlling emulsion and foam stability is fundamental to their widespread application in consumer products and industrial processes. Designed stimuliresponsive peptide surfactants that allow the stability of emulsions and foams to be controlled by changes in solution conditions have recently been developed at the University of Queensland. The research objective of this thesis was to establish the mechanism by which these switchable biosurfactants control emulsion and foam stability and hence contribute design rules for future generations of peptide surfactants. In particular, research focused on the control of emulsion coalescence kinetics and the fundamental insights that these peptide-based emulsions provide into the coalescence phenomena. It was proposed that these switchable peptide surfactants allow the mechanical strength of the viscoelastic surfactant layer to be decoupled from other contributions to emulsion stability. It was found that the established Derjaguin&#8211; Landau&#8211;Vervey&#8211;Overbeek (DLVO) theory, which is frequently used as the basis for predicting emulsion stability, was not able to describe the stability switching observed in the peptide-based emulsions. Different designs of peptide surfactant were used to demonstrate that the kinetics of emulsion coalescence could be shifted by changing the interfacial elasticity, clearly illustrating the critical role of the surfactant layer&#8217;s mechanical properties in the coalescence mechanism. Where the peptide-surfactant-based emulsions enabled triggering a rapid transition to coalescence from a flocculation stable system it was shown that both the electrostatic repulsion (flocculation barrier) and the interfacial elasticity (coalescence barrier) were switched. This work made use of a number of experimental techniques to study the coalescence mechanism, including the observation of droplet interactions in microfluidic channels. The switchable peptide surfactants were shown to enable triggered coalescence in droplet based microfluidics, something that had hereto with proved an intractable challenge for surfactant containing oil-in-water systems. Having established the importance of the mechanical properties of the adsorbed peptide layer in enabling control over coalescence kinetics, it was of interest to study the effect of adding other surfactant species. Mixed surfactant systems are likely to be encountered in industrial applications or commercial products. The peptide surfactant AM1 was mixed with the common anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and synergistic behaviour was identified, including enhanced interfacial adsorption and reversible association of structures in the bulk solution. Furthermore the interfacial layers formed by AM1-SDS retained the switchable mechanical behaviour despite considerable increases in the absolute mechanical strength.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">peptide</field><field name="subject">surfactant</field><field name="subject">protein</field><field name="subject">emulsion</field><field name="subject">foam</field><field name="subject">thin film</field><field name="subject">coalescence</field><field name="subject">DLVO</field><field name="subject">microfluidics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:166727</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating ecologically-inspired displays for complex systems: Hydropower system case study</field><field name="creator">Ms Xi Li</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to explore the theoretical and practical issues associated with the design, execution and analysis of an empirical evaluation of novel process control displays in a collaborative control room environment. An important feature of the thesis is how practical constraints associated with limited access to industry controllers were handled and how convergent lines of evidence were used to achieve the evaluation. As a novel research domain, hydropower systems (HPS) present many design challenges, because controllers must coordinate multiple domains across different time frames. If controllers are to maintain effective situation awareness and if they are to exercise effective control, the displays must integrate controllers&#8217; problem solving across water, generation, market, and transmission concerns and across time frames. However, these needs are ignored in the current displays in a hydropower control room. The two new ecologically-inspired displays, called &#8220;Functional Displays&#8221;, evaluated in this thesis, are intended to overcome the above shortcomings. The evaluation was done with industry hydropower controllers and coordinators on a medium fidelity simulator which represented the working environment of a large hydropower control room. The core issue of this thesis is how the evaluation was conceptualized, operationalized and analysed given practical constraints arising from limited access to industry controllers, limited capacity of the simulator, and the complexity of the hydropower domain. Of key concern was the design of test scenarios, selection of measures of performance, and data analysis in the face of these constraints. The rationale of the scenario design was to combine representative contingencies within and outside the hydropower scheme, emergent storage problems and different market contexts so that controllers or coordinators would be required to act in different domains. Only by placing controllers in such challenging and time pressured situations could we maximize our chances of seeing the expected benefits of the new display, given the limited length of the experiment. Multiple measures were proposed to capture the quality of in-the-loop coupling between human controllers and the system under various disturbances. The measures of performance include: (1) control quality, which investigates how the new displays tame &#8220;temporal complexity&#8221; by helping the control team construct a more effective pattern of activities to handle contingencies; and (2) control strategy, which exposes how the new display support the coordination between storage, generation and market to meet the strategic or tangible objectives. The measures of cognition and affect include: (1) situation awareness (SA), which represents controllers&#8217; or coordinators&#8217; degree of cognitive coupling with different time frames and different levels of the hydropower scheme and (2) controllers&#8217; or coordinators&#8217; trust in the supporting displays, and their self-confidence in their own ability to control the hydropower scheme. Through the effort of triangulating the different measures, balancing the elements in designing scenarios, and extracting and integrating raw data from the study, convergent lines of evidence were achieved for evaluation. It was found that the new Functional Displays led the participant teams to a better pattern of work which was reflected in their situation awareness, their discretionary control activity, and the outcome of their control with respect to system productivity and stability. However, limitations of these findings because of the constraints of the experiment are discussed. This research contributes to many theoretical and practical issues in Human-System Interface (HSI). For example, it outlines how some of the principles of ecological interface design (EID) can be used and it highlights the value of using time as a basis for distinguishing interfaces. Moreover, this research provides fruitful insights into the selection and development of measures to assess human control in real world complex work environments. Because a key issue of this thesis is how practical constraints were handled; pragmatic approaches for measuring SA and control were developed. Because industry often performs evaluations under similar intensive constraints, the approaches and solutions developed in this thesis for evaluating novel interfaces could be easily adapted to various industrial settings.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Ecological Interface Design</field><field name="subject">Hydropower</field><field name="subject">supervisory control</field><field name="subject">situation awareness</field><field name="subject">human performance</field><field name="subject">human control</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:167065</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tailoring Carbon Materials as Fuels for the Direct Carbon Fuel Cells</field><field name="creator">Xiang Li</field><field name="description">As a novel high temperature fuel cell, the direct carbon fuel cell (DCFC) is drawing ever-increasing attention due to its significant high conversion efficiency, diversified fuel resources and low pollution compared with conventional coal-fired power plants. Despite the advantages of the DCFC technology, there are a number of fundamental and technological challenges which need to be overcome for its further development and commercialization. One of the major hurdles in current study of the DCFC is that the efficacy of carbon fuels is still unclear. Meanwhile, the effects of impurities in the carbon fuels on the performance and lifetime of the DCFC are still up for debate. Furthermore, the molecular-level study on the mechanism of electrochemical oxidation of carbon fuels in the DCFC is limited by the lack of techniques to detect the reaction intermediates at high temperature. Finally, how to scale up the DCFC system with suitable hardware materials and optimum structural designs needs further investigation. Based on successfully developing a DCFC system with a stirring molten carbonate electrolyte, various commercial and self-made carbon fuels including activated carbons, carbon blacks, graphitic carbons, coals and carbon nanofibers (CNFs) are systematically characterized and evaluated in this thesis. It is found that the nature of carbon fuels plays an important role in the anodic performance of the DCFC. A higher surface area and a smaller particle size of carbon fuel can effectively improve its electrochemical reactivity by increasing the interaction between the carbon particles and the molten carbonate electrolyte. On the contrary, a higher graphitic degree of carbon fuel results in a lower electrochemical reactivity in the DCFC due to the less reactive sites such as edges and defects on carbon surface. Furthermore, the order of the electrochemical reactivities for carbon fuels is in good agreement with the concentration of oxygen-containing functional groups on their surface, which is believed to play a key role in the electrochemical oxidation of carbons in the DCFC. In order to better understand the relationship between the surface chemistry of carbons and their electrochemical performance in the DCFC, various pre-treatment techniques including acid washing, air-plasma treatment, air oxidation, pyrolysis and the pre-electrochemical oxidation (in molten alkali carbonate electrolytes) have been conducted on the carbon fuels. It is shown that both the HNO3 washing and pre-electrochemical oxidation are much more effective to improve the electrochemical reactivities of carbon fuels compared to other pre-treatment techniques, which is attributed to the significant changes in the microstructure of carbon fuels and more surface oxygen functional groups produced during the pre-treatments. In contrast, the pyrolysis treatment results in a sharp decrease of electrochemical reactivity of carbon fuels due to the decreases in oxygen-containing surface groups and surface areas, and the increase of their graphitic degrees. For the sake of the optimum operational conditions for the DCFC system, the influences of stirring rates, the carbon fuel loadings and fuel cell temperatures on the anodic performance of the DCFC are investigated. It has been shown that the carbon discharge rates can be significantly boosted by effective stirring and high carbon fuel concentrations due to an improved mass transport. A higher operation temperature can also increase the current density and open circuit voltage of the DCFC. However, the complete electrochemical oxidation of carbon into CO2 can be only achieved at the low operation temperature of 600-700 &#186;C, while the partially electrochemical oxidation of carbon into CO occurs at 800 &#186;C, which will significantly decrease the carbon efficiency to less than 10% at 800 &#186;C. In the study of self-made CNFs as fuels for the DCFC, both microstructure and electrochemical reactivity of CNFs are highly dependent on their synthesis conditions. Compared with Ni-Al2O3 catalyst, the coprecipitated Ni-Cu-Al2O3 catalyst produced more CNFs with higher electrochemically reactivity. Over the same catalyst, the CNFs synthesized at lower temperature typically have higher surface areas, more surface oxygen functional groups and lower graphitic degrees, thereby leading to a higher electrochemical reactivity in the DCFC tests. In an effort to study the catalytic effects of mineral impurities on the electrochemical performance of the DCFC, Al2O3 and SiO2 present passivation effects in the anodic reaction. In contrast, the CaO, MgO and Fe2O3 show catalytic effects in the carbon electrochemical oxidation, which is demonstrated by the increases of current densities at low over-potentials in the polarization curves.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fuel Cell</field><field name="subject">Carbon</field><field name="subject">Coal</field><field name="subject">Clean Energy</field><field name="subject">Electrochemical Oxidation</field><field name="subject">Characterization</field><field name="subject">Reactivity</field><field name="subject">Structure</field><field name="subject">Property</field><field name="subject">Surface Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:167339</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Decolonizing Feminism</field><field name="creator">Bronwyn Wex</field><field name="description">The task of attending to cultural difference amongst women while also &#8216;bridging&#8217; these differences is deeply contested in feminism. This concern arose in response to criticisms that &#8216;hegemonic&#8217; feminism is indeed part of the colonial project. These critiques demonstrated that the notion of feminism as a universal movement for all women is deeply problematic and founded on the exclusion of sex, race, and class differences. Subsequently, the aim to recuperate a notion of the universal that refuses these exclusions is of central concern to contemporary feminism. As feminism comes to grip with the impact of globalization on women in different parts of the world, this impetus to engender understanding and alliances across cultural difference is more salient than ever. This thesis explores one response to the dilemma which I term the &#8216;feminist decolonizing impulse&#8217;. Only recently emerging from the field of contemporary feminist theory, this impulse and the key authors which inform it has not be examined in any substantial way. This is where the original contribution of this thesis lies. My main focus is to explore the central aim of this emerging set of ideas and to identify their strengths and weaknesses. I argue that the central aim of the decolonizing impulse is to build feminist alliances and coalitions that are premised, first and foremost, on women&#8217;s heterogeneity. It thus purports to offer a re-constructed vision of the &#8216;universal&#8217;. This is a universalism where differences and particularities are privileged in advance of any announcement of the &#8216;universal&#8217;. To do this, I first establish how the &#8216;feminist decolonizing impulse&#8217; emerged from different fields of scholarship, including postcolonial studies, indigenous political thought, Third World, postcolonial and poststructuralist feminisms. I then map the major features of the &#8216;feminist decolonizing impulse&#8217; by examining the work of important authors who have given shape to this impulse. To discover the strengths and weaknesses of the decolonizing impulse, I engage with the work of two prominent contemporary feminist theorists, Chandra Talpade Mohanty and Martha C. Nussbaum. Both Mohanty and Nussbaum aim to advance a model of cross-cultural feminism, though go about this in vastly different ways.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">360000 Policy and Political Science</field><field name="subject">gender; feminism; cultural difference; decolonizing</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:167468</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional Roles of Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor &#946;/&#948; in a Model of Relapsing-Remitting Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis</field><field name="creator">Madusha Peiris</field><field name="description">Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by lesions that form within the central nervous system which induce symptoms such as muscle weakness and paralysis. Many aspects of MS, ranging from causation to immunopathology, are currently under investigation as little is known of the factors that contribute to and exacerbate this disease. Presently, evidence suggests MS to be an inflammatory disease mediated by an autoimmune response to an unknown antigen. Results from clinical studies as well as animal models such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) suggest MS is initiated and maintained by immune cells such as Th1 lymphocytes. As a result, therapeutics prescribed to MS patients&#8217; focus on modulating the inflammatory response so as to minimize myelin loss and CNS damage. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are a family of transcription factors that show promise as potential targets for MS therapeutics. The PPAR sub-types, PPAR&#945; and PPAR&#947;, have been shown to inhibit the propagation of inflammatory pathways and decrease the activity of pro-inflammatory cells in a number of inflammation driven diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis. The anti-inflammatory role of PPAR&#946;/&#948; is less well known, although preliminary studies suggest activation of this receptor may potentiate the activity of other transcription factors involved in inhibiting inflammatory pathways. As the PPAR family of transcription factors exhibit similar functions, it is hypothesized that the PPAR&#946;/&#948; sub-type may have immunomodulatory effects that are comparable and complimentary to PPAR&#945; and &#8211;&#947;. This thesis describes a novel model of relapsing-remitting EAE (RR-EAE) that presents a disease course where EAE relapses are followed by periods of recovery that are characterized by the absence of clinical symptoms. Furthermore, a therapeutic intervention study carried out using this model demonstrates that the PPAR&#947; agonist pioglitazone can decrease the severity of a relapse episode when drug treatment begins prior to a predicted relapse event. The inhibition of immune cell infiltration into the CNS and decreased immune cell activity mediated by pioglitazone, suggests that this ligand modulates the immune response. These results indicate that pioglitazone may be an effective treatment for relapsing-remitting MS. To examine the role of PPAR&#946;/&#948; in RR-EAE and explore its effect on the activity of inflammatory cells, PPAR&#946;/&#948; knockout mice were used due to the current lack of specific antagonists for this receptor. PPAR&#946;/&#948; wild-type mice developed RR-EAE when immunized using protocol intended to induce this disease course. PPAR&#946;/&#948; knockout mice however, developed chronic EAE when immunized in the same manner. Consistent with sustained clinical symptoms, CNS immune cell infiltration and activity was maintained throughout the disease in PPAR&#946;/&#948; knockout mice. In contrast, the presence of immune cells within the CNS and consequent activity fluctuated according to the relapse and recovery pattern of disease in PPAR&#946;/&#948; wild-type mice. PPAR&#946;/&#948; appears to modulate inflammation by potentiating the apoptosis of activated T cells. Therefore, PPAR&#946;/&#948; agonists may be potential candidates for MS treatment.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Experiemental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis</field><field name="subject">Peroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptor</field><field name="subject">Model</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:167471</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stochastic Modelling and Intervention of the Spread of HIV/AIDS</field><field name="creator">Asrul Sani</field><field name="description">Since the &#64257;rst cases of HIV/AIDS disease were recognised in the early 1980s, a large number of mathematical models have been proposed. However, the mobility of people among regions, which has an obvious impact on the spread of the disease, has not been much considered in the modelling studies. One of the main reasons is that the models for the spread of the disease in multiple populations are very complex and, as a consequence, they can easily become intractable. In this thesis we provide various new results pertaining to the spread of the disease in mobile populations, including epidemic intervention in multiple populations. We &#64257;rst develop stochastic models for the spread of the disease in a single heterosexual population, considering both constant and varying population sizes. In particular, we consider a class of continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs). We establish deterministic and Gaussian diffusion analogues of these stochastic processes by applying the theory of density dependent processes. A range of numerical experiments are provided to show how well the deterministic and Gaussian counterparts approximate the dynamic behaviour of the processes. We derive threshold parameters, known as basic reproduction numbers, for both cases above the threshold which the disease is uniformly persistent and below the threshold which disease-free equilibrium is locally attractive. We &#64257;nd that the threshold conditions for both constant and varying population sizes have the same form. In order to take into account the mobility of people among regions, we extend the stochastic models to multiple populations. Various stochastic models for multiple populations are formulated as CTMCs. The deterministic and Gaussian diffusion counterparts of the corresponding stochastic processes for the multiple populations are also established. Threshold parameters for the persistence of the disease in the multiple population models are derived by applying the concept of next generation matrices. The results of this study can serve as a basic framework how to formulate and analyse a more realistic stochastic model for the spread of HIV in mobile heterogeneous populations&#8212;classifying all individuals by age, risk, and level of infectivities, and at the same time considering different modes of the disease transmission. Assuming an accurate mathematical model for the spread of HIV/AIDS disease, another question that we address in this thesis is how to control the spread of the disease in a mobile population. Most previous studies for the spread of the disease focus on identifying the most signi&#64257;cant parameters in a model. In contrast, we study these problems as optimal epidemic intervention problems. The study is mostly motivated by the fact that more and more local governments allocate budgets over a certain period of time to combat the disease in their areas. The question is how to allocate this limited budget to minimise the number of new HIV cases, say on a country level, over a &#64257;nite time horizon as people move among regions. The mathematical models developed in the &#64257;rst part of this thesis are used as dynamic constraints of the optimal control problems. In this thesis, we also introduce a novel approach to solve quite general optimal control problems using the Cross-Entropy (CE) method. The effectiveness of the CE method is demonstrated through several illustrative examples in optimal control. The main application is the optimal epidemic intervention problems discussed above. These are highly non-linear and multidimensional problems. Many existing numerical techniques for solving such optimal control problems suffer from the curse of dimensionality. However, we &#64257;nd that the CE technique is very efficient in solving such problems. The numerical results of the optimal epidemic strategies obtained via the CE method suggest that the structure of the optimal trajectories are highly synchronised among patches but the trajectories do not depend much on the structure of the models. Instead, the parameters of the models (such as the time horizon, the amount of available budget, infection rates) much affect the form of the solution.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HIV/AIDS, Mobility, Multiple Patches, Epidemiology, Density Dependent Markov</field><field name="subject">Diffusion Approximation, Epidemic Control, Cross-Entropy Method</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:167530</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of Group Norms, Audiences, and Social Identities on Moral Judgment</field><field name="creator">Lisa Abel</field><field name="description">Traditionally, it has been the cognitive-developmental approach that has dominated moral judgment research. Specifically, it has been Kohlberg&#8217;s theory of moral development (1969, 1986) that has provided the theoretical framework for much of the research in the field. According to the Kohlbergian perspective, individuals are rational agents who engage in conscious deliberation in order to reach a moral judgment or decision. In contrast to this, the social intuitionist model of moral judgment (Haidt, 2001; Haidt &amp; Bjorklund, 2007) proposes that it is the individual&#8217;s immediate affective reactions to events are the overriding cause of moral judgment. In addition to this, the model proposes that the social context is an equally important determinant of moral judgment. Emergent group norms are said to directly shape the moral judgments of the individual, with the moral judgments of friends, allies and acquaintances having a direct bearing on the moral judgments one makes, even those made and held privately. In the current thesis, the impact of social persuasion - group norms, audience, and social identity - on moral judgment was investigated, using the methods and meta-theoretical framework of the social identity approach. In Studies 1 (N = 98) and 2 (N = 60) the influence of group norms and level of identification with the reference group on participants&#8217; moral evaluations was assessed. The results of these studies revealed that participants&#8217; evaluation of the target issue (the sex selection of children) was not influenced by the group norms to which they were exposed. In both studies, the interaction between norm and identification was also found to be non-significant. Under investigation in Studies 3, 4, and 5 was the impact of normative influence on participants&#8217; moral evaluations. In Study 3 (N = 186) the impact of group norms, level of identification, and audience expectation on participants&#8217; moral evaluations of morally-tinged scenarios and issues were assessed. Those exposed to a norm portraying the reference group as judgmental tended to be harsher in their evaluations than those exposed to a non-judgmental norm, but the effect was weak and inconsistent. Contrary to expectation, identification and audience were not found to interact with the norm manipulation. Study 4 (N = 93) focused exclusively on the impact of audience expectation on participants&#8217; moral evaluation. Participants evaluated a number of morally-tinged scenarios either alone, under the expectation that their responses would be visible to an audience (with either the opportunity to justify their evaluations, or not), or under the pretext of being connected to a lie-detector. Contrary to expectation, no significant difference in participants&#8217; moral evaluations was found across the four audience conditions. To discount the possibility that the lack of normative influence on moral evaluation obtained in Study 4 was due to methodological limitation (i.e., the audience category was too broad), the selection of participants and the choice of audience were modified for Study 5 (N = 54). In Study 5, Christian students were required to make their moral evaluations under the expectation that their responses would be made visible to either a Christian or student audience. Contrary to expectation, only a subtle effect of audience was found in relation to both the morally tinged issues and the morally tinged scenarios. Participants in the Christian audience condition were found to evaluate only a small number of the issues (3 of 10), and only one of the four scenarios more negatively than those in the student audience condition. In Studies 6 and 7 the impact of social identity factors on participants&#8217; moral evaluations was investigated. In Study 6 (N = 45), the extent to which participants&#8217; moral evaluation were influenced by their social identity was assessed. In this study, participants had either their Christian identity or their student identity made salient when making their evaluations. No difference in participants&#8217; moral evaluations was found between the Christian identity and student identity salience conditions. In Study 7 (N = 68), the extent to which participants&#8217; political identity influenced their moral evaluation of government policy was assessed. Participants (who were either Australian Labor Party supporters or Australian Liberal Party supporters) were led to believe that the policies had been proposed by either the Australian Labor Party or the Australian Liberal Party. It was found that participants&#8217; political affiliation contributed to their moral evaluation of the presented policies. Overall, the current program of studies provides a first step toward understanding the impact that group norms, audience, and social identity factors have on the evaluation component of moral judgment. It suggests that morality is complex, and that moral judgments may be amenable to social influence, albeit weakly. Theoretical and practical implications for this research are discussed with reference to social identity theory and the broader literature on moral psychology.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="subject">group norms, audiences, social identities, moral judgment</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:167552</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Proenvironmental Behaviour in Organisations: The Role of Emotion and Issue Ownership</field><field name="creator">Sally Russell</field><field name="description">It is now clear that managers, and their organisations, are under increasing pressure to respond to environmental issues (IPCC, 2007; KPMG, 2005). Research has identified the important role that individuals play in affecting organisational change (Andersson &amp; Bateman, 2000; Bansal, 2003; Starik, 1995), yet more remains to be done. Despite past success of cognitive and behavioural perspectives in explaining proenvironmental behaviours, few researchers have explored its affective dimensions (Kals &amp; Maes, 2002; Vining &amp; Ebreo, 2002). While organisations and the natural environment (ONE) research does mention emotive components of proenvironmental behaviours (Andersson &amp; Bateman, 2000; Bansal &amp; Roth, 2000; Ramus &amp; Steger, 2000), there are very few studies that examine emotion directly. The lack of affective research on environmental issues in organisations has meant that ONE research has not kept pace with the theoretical and empirical developments in wider management literature that clearly demonstrate that emotion is an inescapable part of work-life (Ashforth &amp; Humphrey, 1995; Fineman, 2003; H&#228;rtel, Zerbe, &amp; Ashkanasy, 2005). As such, therefore, more research is needed to examine further the role of emotion in driving proenvironmental behaviours (Kals &amp; Maes, 2002; Vining &amp; Ebreo, 2002). Within this research, I aim to address this need by developing an understanding of the contribution of emotion to workplace proenvironmental behaviours. I draw on Weiss and Cropanzano&#8217;s (1996) Affective Events Theory and Pratt and Dutton&#8217;s (2000) theory of issue ownership to assimilate current understanding of the role of emotion in proenvironmental behaviour, from the fields of environmental psychology, ONE, and emotions in organisations. I also integrate Stern&#8217;s (2000) Value-Belief-Norm theory in order to account for both attitudinal and affective antecedents of proenvironmental behaviour. The relationships between environmental issues, emotions, and proenvironmental behaviour were explored in Study 1. Thematic analysis and content analysis of 31 interview transcripts revealed that managers experience positive and negative emotional responses to environmental issues. Results showed that emotions were expressed significantly more often when managers discussed environmental issues and proenvironmental behaviours at the individual level, compared to the organisational level. These findings demonstrate the importance of the organisational context in exploring the antecedents of workplace proenvironmental behaviour. In Study 2, my aim was to test a conceptual model of affective and attitudinal components of workplace proenvironmental behaviour. The sample for the study was 324 employees from five Australian organisations. I developed a web-survey to collect data from the employees and used structural equation modelling (SEM) to analyse the data. Results showed that aggregated positive emotions enhanced workplace proenvironmental behaviours. Contrary to expectations, however, I found that aggregated negative emotion impeded proenvironmental behaviour. Furthermore, results suggested that the direct relationships between emotion and behaviour were more important than the mediated effect of issue ownership. I conducted two experiments to test further the direct effects of emotion on workplace proenvironmental behaviour and issue ownership. In Study 3, I conducted a laboratory experiment. Five discrete emotions were manipulated using audio-visual stimuli developed for the purposes of the research. One hundred and ninety-four masters and final year undergraduate students participated in the study. Results demonstrated that emotions of the same valence led to different effects on workplace proenvironmental behaviour intentions and recycling behaviours. Contrary to expectations, results showed no significant effect of emotion on environmental issue ownership. Study 4 extended this work by testing the effect of the five discrete emotion manipulations in a field study. The sample for the study was 135 office-based employees. Results revealed that the emotion manipulations had a significant effect on proenvironmental behaviour, as measured by requests for information on improving environmental performance. Congruent with findings from Study 3, results of Study 4 demonstrated that emotions of the same valence led to different effects on workplace proenvironmental behaviour. Comparisons of effect sizes across Studies 3 and 4 revealed attenuation of the effect of emotion in an organisational setting. Together, these findings demonstrate the importance of emotion as an antecedent of proenvironmental behaviour. Findings demonstrated the significant role of organisational context in the relationship between emotions and workplace proenvironmental behaviour. Indeed, this research demonstrates that emotional reactions can induce proenvironmental behaviour. In a workplace context, however, results revealed that individuals also look to the organisation for cues as to the appropriateness of engaging in such behaviour. This research has implications for theory, research, and practice, and makes a contribution to the three research areas of organisations and the natural environment, environmental psychology, and emotions in organisations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">environmental issues</field><field name="subject">proenvironmental behaviour</field><field name="subject">emotion</field><field name="subject">issue ownership</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:167564</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Short sequence tags reveal global transcription of repetitive elements in mammalian genomes</field><field name="creator">Geoffrey Faulkner</field><field name="description">Retrotransposon mobilization is a major source of genome evolution. However, the functional consequences of these events, and particularly their influence upon transcriptional activity, are poorly defined. The extent of retrotransposon transcription, as well as that of other repetitive elements, has eluded systematic study due to difficulties in discriminating elements copied in multiple genomic loci. Moreover, the potential regulatory effects of retrotransposon transcription upon the expression of neighbouring protein-coding genes are also largely unknown. This thesis develops methods to survey repetitive element expression and assess the functions of retrotransposons in the mouse and human genomes. Chapter 1 summarises the complex transcriptional output of the mammalian genome, the functional annotation of this expression and the genomic and bioinformatic tools available for its detection. Chapter 2 explores the capacity of short sequence tags to discern transcription from individual repetitive elements, as well as from protein-coding genes. It is based upon a publication that critiqued the bioinformatics associated with Cap Analysis Gene Expression (CAGE) and developed novel methodologies to resolve repetitive element transcription. Chapter 3 describes the development of an updated CAGE mapping pipeline for the fourth stage of the international Functional Annotation of Mouse (FANTOM) project, which lead to the generation of a research article and a book chapter. These works demonstrated the enhanced utility of CAGE when coupled with next-generation sequencing, highlighted the benefits of CAGE when applied to systems biology and profiled the temporal expression of human repetitive elements. Chapter 4 presents an in-depth analysis of repetitive element transcription in the mouse and human genomes. Using CAGE, approximately 250,000 retrotransposon associated transcription start sites were defined, many of which were tissue-specific. Retrotransposons were found to frequently function as alternative promoters for protein-coding genes and/or express non-coding RNAs. Furthermore, when retrotransposons were found within the 3&#8217;UTR of protein-coding genes, there was strong evidence for the reduced expression of the corresponding transcripts. A genome-wide screen for strong expression correlation between repetitive elements and neighbouring protein-coding genes identified approximately 23,000 candidate regulatory regions derived from retrotransposons, including several hundred putative boundary elements. These were in addition to more than two thousand examples of bidirectional transcription found in retrotransposons, which are known to be a source of double stranded RNAs involved in RNA interference. Chapter 5 explores the proportion of the mouse embryonic stem cell transcriptome comprised of repeat-derived transcripts, using next-generation RNA sequencing. This study defined the dynamic expression of repetitive elements at the greatest resolution achieved to date and demonstrated that repetitive elements are an intrinsic part of the mammalian transcriptional landscape.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="subject">Repetitive Dna</field><field name="subject">Retrotransposon</field><field name="subject">Sequence-tag Analysis</field><field name="subject">Transcription</field><field name="subject">Transcriptome</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:167578</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Speech Pathology Service Provision for Children with Speech and/or Language Impairment in Tasmania</field><field name="creator">Belinda Jessup</field><field name="description">Purpose: The overall objective of the present study was to conduct a series of investigations to examine the need for, and use of speech pathology services by school-aged children in Tasmania. Specifically, investigations aimed to: a) report the prevalence of speech and/or language impairment amongst the preparatory student population enrolled in 2005 in the Northern Branch of the Department of Education Tasmania; b) determine the extent to which speech pathology services were used by this preparatory student population during their prior kindergarten year (2004); c) quantify the presence and degree of any unmet speech pathology service need within this specific student population; d) examine the nature and accuracy of teacher identification of speech and language impairment amongst the student population during their prior kindergarten year using current mandatory educational assessment (Kindergarten Development Check [KDC]); and e) explore teacher referral patternsfor students identified as having speech and/or language impairment on mandatory educational assessment, to speech pathology services. Methods: To address the aims of the present study, three individual data sets were used. The first data set was obtained through direct assessment of the speech and language skills of a cohort (N = 308) of preparatory students by a speech-language pathologist in 2005. This data was used to determine the prevalence of speech and/or language impairment. The second data set was information pertaining to the number of enrolled preparatory students who had accessed speech pathology services in their prior kindergarten year (2004), sourced from the speech pathology database of the Northern Branch of the Department of Education Tasmania. Comparison of data from the direct assessment of students by the speech-language pathologist and information from the speech pathology database enabled a determination of the presence and degree of any unmet speech pathology service need within this specific student population. The third and final data set was the results of the KDC, conducted by teachers on all students in their kindergarten year (2004). This data was obtained following a search within the electronic KDC database. Subsequent comparison between the student results from this KDC database and the direct assessment by the speech-language pathologist determined the accuracy of teacher identification of speech and/or language impairment using this specific tool. Further comparison of the student results from the KDC database, direct assessment and the speech pathology database also yielded information on teacher referral patterns for students identified as either speech or language-impaired on the KDC, together with the overall percentage of confirmed speech or language-impaired students referred to speech pathology services.Results: The overall prevalence of speech and/or language impairment was found to be 41.2% within the population studied. Specifically, 8.7% of students were found to have isolated speech impairment, 18.2% had isolated language impairment, and 14.3% were diagnosed with comorbid speech and language impairment. Despite the high overall prevalence of speech and/or language impairment, only 18.4% of the total enrolled preparatory student population was found to have accessed speech pathology services during their kindergarten year. It was therefore estimated that 36.1% of speech-impaired and 75.8% of language-impaired preparatory students respectively did not access speech pathology services during their first year at school. Comparison of student data from educational and speech pathology testing observed that the current teacher-administered kindergarten assessment (KDC) was ineffective in facilitating student access to speech pathology services where needed. The sensitivity of teacher identification of speech and language impairment on the KDC was only 50% and 15% respectively, indicating that 50% of all students confirmed as having speech impairment and 85% of students confirmed as having language impairment on speech pathology testing failed to be identified by teaching professionals on this specific tool. Further consideration of teacher referral patterns found that only 57.1% of students identified by teachers as having some type of communication impairment on the KDC were subsequently referred to speech pathology services. Of those students referred, only just over half (51.4%) were confirmed by speech pathology assessment as being either speech or languageimpaired, with the remainder found to have typical speech and language skills. When the total speech and language-impaired population was examined, the percentage of children appropriately referred by teachers was therefore only 25.3%.Conclusions: The present study illustrated that speech and language impairment are prevalent conditions within the preparatory student population of northern Tasmania. Unfortunately, a substantial number of these speech and/or language-impaired students failed to access available speech pathology services during their kindergarten year. Teacher administration of mandatory educational assessment, designed to identify &#8216;at risk&#8217; kindergarten students, has been identified as one reason for poor student access to speech pathology services during the first year of formal schooling. Not only were teachers found to be inaccurate in identifying students with speech, and to a greater extent language impairment using the KDC, but students identified as having speech and/or language impairment on this specific tool were not routinely referred to speech pathology services. Given the key role of teachers in administering the KDC to identify students in need of speech pathology services, local speechlanguage pathologists must seek to improve: a) the sensitivity of the KDC; and b) the knowledge of teaching professionals regarding the presentation of speech and/or language impairment and the importance of early referral.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">speech, language, service provision, kindergarten</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:167629</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular Dynamics on a Grand Scale: Towards large-scale atomistic simulations of self-assembling biomolecular systems</field><field name="creator">Matthew Breeze</field><field name="description">To explore progressively larger biomolecular systems, methods to model explicit solvent cheaply are required.

It was shown that the GPU implementation of the SPC constraint-solving algorithm SETTLE was overall 26% faster than a conventional implementation running on a Central Processing Unit (CPU) core. The non-bonded forces were calculated up to 17 times faster than using a CPU core. Using these two approaches, an overall speed up of around 4 times was found. The most successful implementation of the pair-list generation ran at 38% the speed of a conventional grid-based implementation on a CPU core.

The research asks if the lives of young Muslims in Hong Kong can be discussed through the concept of &#8216;everyday hybridity&#8217; in response to existing sociological debate on hybrid identities and culture. The thesis critiques the existing debate on cultural hybridity and argues for a broader discussion on multicultural youth that moves beyond the existing focus on multiculturalism in the West. It offers an account of Muslim youth in a non-Western context and challenges a number of popular assumptions about them in the post 9/11 era. Everyday hybridity is proposed as a concept to discuss mundane themes of cultural hybridity that are often overlooked in the celebration of hybrid styles in youth research. It is developed through an analysis of works on cultural hybridity and everyday life sociology and operationalises the theory of cultural hybridity. Work on youth, multiculturalism, and Muslims as political minorities are used to identify key themes of everyday hybridity relevant for the research. The themes, language, space, and religious practice provide the focus for the discussion and analysis of the participant interviews. The analysis of the participant testimonies is used to argue that hybridity can be palpably represented in research and that it is a common and normal facet of life in multicultural communities. It demonstrates that young Muslims in Hong Kong value the freedom and safety they have despite the fact that many experience racism and are subject to government education policies that limit their employment prospects. As a result everyday hybridity provides a new way to understand Muslim youth in Hong Kong. This thesis concludes by assessing the contribution of the research to discussions on cultural hybridity, Muslim youth in Hong Kong, and the global focus on youth studies. The closing discussion outlines a number of policy suggestions; it argues that the everyday focus of the research provides a model to think broadly and sensitively about what young Muslims truly value about life in Hong Kong when striving to improve circumstances for them.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts - General</field><field name="subject">hong kong, hybridity, everyday life, islam, muslims, youth, racism, multiculturalism, postcolonialism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:167635</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the Rukmini-Krsna Bhakti Tradition in Maharashtra</field><field name="creator">Acharaya Kailashachandra Shastri</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT The local bhakti tradition prevalent and popular in the state of Mah&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra in India worships Rukmi&#7751;&#299;-K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a (Ru-K) as the divine couple. The divine couple R&#257;dh&#257;-K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as the object of devotion of the greater Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava bhakti tradition has been the focus of several academic studies. Almost all scholarly publications and literature relating to the religious tradition of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a tend to focus on R&#257;dh&#257;-K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as the divine couple. In contrast, very little is published on Rukmi&#7751;&#299;-K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as a divine couple. My doctoral research examines the almost 700-year old Rukmi&#7751;&#299;-K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a bhakti tradition that is still very much alive today and that continues to thrive in the state of Mah&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra in India. The research has focused on centrality of Goddess Rukmi&#7751;&#299; in the tradition and its doctrine as revealed from the Mar&#257;&#7789;h&#299; devotional literature written by its poet-sants. I also study the devotional practices and profile of contemporary Ru-K tradition followers to establish how their understanding of the doctrine influences and shapes their personal practices. In particular, I explore the hypothesis that the Rukmi&#7751;&#299;-K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a bhakti tradition is a distinctive, syncretistic, and living devotional tradition that integrates Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava and &#346;aiva elements in its Marathi poet-sant literature as well as in its religious practice amongst its followers. Thus, in both theory and practice, the tradition caters to the needs and dispositions of followers from various social classes. My research methodology mainly comprised textual analysis Mar&#257;&#7789;h&#299; devotional literature written by the four major poet-sants of the Ru-K bhakti tradition. The research also involved a small component of field trip to study the contemporary followers and practices of the tradition. Research revealed that the followers of Rukmi&#7751;i-K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a bhakti tradition look upon Rukmi&#7751;&#299; as pure devotee of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The analysis of the hagiographies and local legends reveal Rukmi&#7751;&#299;&#8217;s role as a mediator and facilitator of meetings of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a with those who love him and are devoted to him. Acting as a mediator between K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and his common devotees, she brought him out of his royal pastimes of Dv&#257;rak&#257; to Pa&#7751;&#7693;harapura, albeit on the pretext of getting upset with him. Following K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&#8217;s appearance in Pa&#7751;&#7693;harapura, it has become the centre and springboard of Rukmi&#7751;&#299;-K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a bhakti tradition. The Pa&#7751;&#7693;harapura pastimes of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a primarily involve personal loving exchanges between K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a (as Vi&#7789;&#7789;hala) and his devotees from all walks of life. In these pastimes, Rukmi&#7751;&#299; plays the compassionate mediator between K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and his devotees, facilitating their meetings and exchanges. Therefore, Rukmi&#7751;&#299; is also looked upon by devotees as a kind and considerate mother. Analysis of the sant literature of the tradition revealed the dichotomous doctrinal stance of Advaitic (non dualistic) nirgu&#7751;a bhakti towards an impersonal Supreme taken by J&#241;&#257;ne&#347;vara and Ekan&#257;tha, and that of Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava (dualistic) sagu&#7751;a bhakti towards a personalised form of Supreme, taken by N&#257;madeva and Tuk&#257;r&#257;ma, co-existing under the umbrella of Rukmi&#7751;&#299;-K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a bhakti tradition. The reason for such a harmonious co-existence of mutually incompatible doctrines and flourishing of the tradition despite the incongruity is owing to the two common practices, singing the glories of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and worshipping of personal form of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, both of which are considered to be of significance by both doctrines, albeit for different reasons and to achieve dissimilar objectives. Both practices have been instrumental in bringing together the followers and devotees with contrasting and incompatible doctrinal leanings. The case study of the contemporary devotees revealed a dichotomy, in the form of two different classes of devotees found within the tradition, one consisting of the non-elite rank and file devotees from rural and semi-urban regions displaying sagu&#7751;a bhakti practices and understanding, and the other consisting of devotees from the elite class taking an Advaitic nirgu&#7751;a stance. These classes continue to be maintained because the preachers, although Advaitic in their personal stance, tend to preach sagu&#7751;a bhakti to the masses, considering them to be insufficiently qualified for the advanced stage of Advaita. Consequently, the dichotomy perpetuates itself and is apparently harmonized through this bivalence on the part of preachers and common devotees. The unique aspect involving the fusion of &#346;aivism and Vai&#7779;&#7751;avism that one finds in the form of Hari-hara-aikya-bhava, sets the Rukmi&#7751;&#299;-K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a bhakti tradition distinctly apart from the greater Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava tradition, where such a fusion is not just absent, but rather clearly and consciously avoided.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rukmini-krishna, vitthala, rukmini, marathi vaishnavism, varakari, panduranga, saguna bhakti, nirguna bhakti, marathi poet-sant, pandharpur.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:167636</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetics of Lipid Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Australian Families</field><field name="creator">Rita Middelberg</field><field name="description">Plasma lipid, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein levels are considered as important and well-established intermediate quantitative phenotypes of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk. Both the mean values and the phenotypic variance vary over the human lifespan. However, it is not known whether there is a genetic basis for this age variability. For example, might different genes act, or different gene interactions occur, as a person ages? If so, how might this be influenced by both environment and phenotype? An understanding of traits at different ages will not only provide insight into the genetic components involved in CHD development, but may also identify additional genetic factors that predispose an individual or population to premature (and later-onset) CHD. By identifying genetic factors that account for variation in important intermediate traits (i.e. lipid levels), we hope to gain a better understanding of disease mechanisms and thus a better chance of developing clinical strategies for preventing or possibly treating abnormal lipid levels and, by association, CHD. The aim of this thesis was to better identify and explain the genetic basis of CHD by focusing on the use of lipid traits as intermediate quantitative phenotypes of CHD. First, phenotypic analyses using structural equation modeling were performed to estimate the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors, and also to investigate whether these traits are influenced by the same gene(s) across time or whether they are age-specific genetic effects. Then, genome-wide linkage analysis was performed to localize cardiovascular susceptibility loci. Finally, a small genome-wide association scan (GWAS) was performed on a subset of the data to identify the relevant variants, in particular those showing associations across time. Phenotypes and marker data were collected in two Australian samples: an adolescent and adult twin pair samples. The adult sample consisted of 1453 twin pairs (968 monozygotic and 485 dizygotic), measured for lipid traits. 415 adult twins provided blood on two to five occasions. The adolescent dataset consisted of 965 twin families (397 monozygotic and 568 dizygotic) measured longitudinally at ages twelve, fourteen and sixteen, and their siblings tested once for the same lipid variables. Results from both the adult and adolescent cohorts indicated that there is more than one genetic factor influencing total cholesterol, HDL, LDL and triglycerides over time (i.e. from different measurement occasions). Common environmental factors did not contribute to variances (except for HDL in adolescents). There were no sex differences in the heritabilities of these intermediate phenotypes. Non-shared environmental factors did not have significant long-term effects. Overall, these two cohorts confirmed that genetic variation contributes substantially to variation in these traits, and suggested there are changes in the genes affecting plasma lipid concentration at different periods of life. Thus, there are age-dependent gene effects influencing HDL, LDL, total cholesterol, or triglycerides at different ages. In the adult genome data, there were 485 adult dizygotic twin pairs typed on average 595 markers, at an average inter-marker distance of 5.0 cM. The genome-wide linkage analysis revealed evidence for linkage in the 7p13 region for triglycerides. Possible candidate genes included NPC1L1 and GSBS. Other regions of &#8220;suggestive&#8221; linkage identified were chromosome 4p13 (at 62 cM) and Xq26.2-28 (81 cM). Adolescent twins and their siblings from 760 families were typed for linkage using 16,781 markers spaced across the genome at an average distance of 6.25 cM. The adolescent data revealed evidence for linkage to region 6p24.3 for triglycerides (&#8211;log10p = 6.81; equivalent LOD = 6.13; p = 0.00000016) and to region 2q31.1 for HDL (&#8211;log10p = 3.22, equivalent LOD = 2.27; p = 0.00061). No obvious candidate gene is known in this 6p region. Possible candidate genes in the 2q region include LRP2 and ABCB11. A significant region of linkage was also found on 2q35 for LDL (&#8211;log10p = 5.59; equivalent LOD score = 4.53). Other interesting regions of linkage included chromosomes 1q32.1, 4p15.1, 5q13.2, 11p14.3 and 18q11.2. Thus, regions were identified by linkage analyses that are likely to harbour genetic risk factors for cardiovascular disease in the analysed Australian population: chromosomes 7p13 (in adults), 6p24 (adolescents), 2q31.1 and 2q35 (in adolescents). Other regions included 1q32.1, 4p15.1, 5q13.2, 11p14.3 and 18q11.2 in adolescents and chromosome 4p13 and Xq26.2&#8211;28 in adults. Genome-wide association results for adolescents showed significant evidence of association between total cholesterol at age 14 (p = 8.24x10-7) and rs10503840 on 8p21.1. Such association has not previously been reported. Evidence of differential association across time was also found between HDL and variant rs10492859, located in the intron of the CDH13 gene, consistent with earlier studies on larger datasets. Significant association (p = 2.25x10-6) was also found between rs10507266 on 12q24.21 in an intron of THRAP2, a gene involved in early development of heart and brain, with triglycerides at age 12. Evidence of association was also found between HDL across time and variant rs10492859 on 16q23. Several other &#8220;suggestive&#8221; potential loci associated with lipid traits at one time point as well as across time were also found. In conclusion, the work described in this thesis establishes the importance of age-specific genetic effects on plasma lipids and lipoproteins, and identifies several regions of highly significant genetic linkage with these phenotypes in either adolescence or adulthood. It is clear that, as well as cross-sectional studies to identify genes affecting CVD risk factors, longitudinal genetic linkage and association studies are needed to assess relative contributions to risk across the lifespan.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lipids</field><field name="subject">cardiovascular</field><field name="subject">twins</field><field name="subject">Linkage</field><field name="subject">Genome-wide Association</field><field name="subject">Longitudinal</field><field name="subject">adolescents</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:167660</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutrition and Diet in Roman Britain</field><field name="creator">Elizabeth Crane</field><field name="description">The thesis has considered what foods were available to the populations of the Late Iron Age and Roman Britain and the levels of nutrition possible. Evidence for (or the absence of) nutritional deficiency diseases was used to reach conclusions about the standard of health, and knowledge of modern nutritional food models enabled the author to assess the state of health of ancient individuals from a study of the foods to which they had access. To provide a benchmark for what can be ascertained about the Roman&#8217;s choices in food production, selection, cooking, consumption and storage, an examination was made of the sites of Pompeii and Herculaneum, where archaeological investigations have revealed aspects of daily life, trade, living and cooking arrangements, food utensils and human remains. A study of the literary sources determined the attitude of the Romans towards food; it was clear that Romans in the ancient world knew how to source their food, and were aware that, if not properly handled, some food could be detrimental to their health. Sites in Britain from the pre-Roman Iron Age were then considered in regards to food production, selection, cooking and storage, in order to be able to assess the situation after the Roman invasion. For the Roman period, different types of sites were considered: small and larger civilian centres and cemeteries, and military bases. To discover if there were regional differences in diet or nutrition, sites were selected from the North, Midlands, East Anglia, the South and South East and the South West. Also discussed was the role that external influences, features and facilities and occupation of each site had on developing the level of health of their inhabitants. It was found that the native and introduced populations throughout Britain during the Romano-British era did have access to a nutritionally sound food supply, and thus it was possible for them to maintain a healthy diet. Despite the introduction of new foods with the advent of the Romans, there was no discernable difference in the state of health and nutrition from the Iron Age to the Roman, with the exception of dental health, where there was a distinct deterioration as the result of sugar-rich foods being added to the diet. Those cases where the nutritional levels of the people fell below what might be considered conducive to good health were probably due to other factors: it was the physical features or facilities of a settlement (or lack of them) and the occupations and economic status of individuals that actually dictated standards of health.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Roman Britain, Diet, Nutrition, Food, Human Remains, Iron Age, Ancient Sources, Pompeii</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:170369</field></doc><doc><field name="title">It's for love not money: Queensland graziers' perceptions of sustainable development</field><field name="creator">Jennifer Moffatt</field><field name="description">Despite a National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development and the embodiment of this in numerous national and state statues, environmental degradation continues to occur on rural land. This raises the question of how the primary land managers in Queensland perceive sustainable development. Australia&#8217;s early reliance on agricultural production and international markets contributed substantially to the extensive environmental degradation that has occurred. Consequently economic and environmental issues have dominated the research on sustainable development, with the social dimension relatively neglected. In addition, despite the large quantity of work that has been conducted with farmers and graziers, little is known about how either of these types of land managers interpret sustainable development. The aim of this thesis was to develop an in-depth understanding of graziers&#8217; perceptions of sustainable development to make a contribution to this area. An exploratory interpretative approach was taken to conduct this investigation because previous research had been limited. In-depth unstructured interviews were conducted with 57 Queensland graziers in the tropical savannas in a case study with two locations &#8211; the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Central West. This approach was supported by participant observation and a brief questionnaire to provide background information. The fieldwork was conducted over a period of five months which allowed analysis to be conducted as the study progressed. Most of the graziers were interviewed on their properties with the goal of adding richness to the data and assisting with interpretation. Several bodies of literature have been used to interpret the results of this study. Areas of the sustainable development literature relevant to this thesis are reviewed to provide a context for the thesis. The literature on structural change in Australian agriculture provides a background to the broad influences on the agricultural sector and farmers. Also reviewed are the approaches taken to change the land management practices of farmers. The enduring value of farming and the changing values of rural land use are explored through a review of agrarianism, the goals and values of farmers and the post-productivist transition. The results for both study locations showed that these graziers preference the economic dimension of sustainable development over the environmental and social dimensions. The rationale for this preference is that maintaining economic viability will allow them to achieve their social goal &#8211; to continue their preferred way of life. A strong focus therefore, is on economic viability as a means to a social end. The objective is to overcome the constraints of being market and season dependent and the costs of operating in rural and remote locations through a whole-of-enterprise business management approach. The need for graziers to continue increasing their productivity to remain economically viable and to continue being competitive in international markets, challenges their ability to balance the economic and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. For some the environmental dimension of sustainable development may be compromised to accommodate their economic priorities and social goals. A perceived future threat, more so for Gulf graziers, arises from the belief that they and their interests are marginalised through consultation processes. This contributes to their belief that the government prioritises Aboriginal land rights and environmental protection interests over their production interests. They believe that if this continues their future is at risk through further decreases to the security of their tenure. The results of this study suggest that a more innovative and integrated approach will be required to meet the challenges of sustainable development in these areas, in early twenty-first century Australia. The holistic approach from a social science perspective has provided an understanding of what graziers value and why. These insights contribute to knowledge of how to progress sustainable development. They could be tested with other types of land managers and as a foundation on which to build a more comprehensive understanding of sustainable development.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sustainable development; graziers; farmers; agriculture; land management; business</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:170415</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gram-Positive Bacteria in Sub-Tropical Marine Fish and their Mesophilic Spoilage Potential</field><field name="creator">Ismail Mohamed Ali Al-bulushi</field><field name="description">Gram-positive bacteria are part of the normal flora of fish from different aquatic environments. They are mesophilic bacteria and demonstrate optimum growth at ambient temperature. In the sub-tropics, marine fish are caught from seas at temperatures of 16 to 34&#61616;C, they are usually not iced and are handled at ambient temperature. It was hypothesized that under these conditions Gram-positive bacteria will be abundant in sub-tropical marine fish and will have roles in the spoilage of fish. A review of literature showed that there is a gap in understanding the Gram-positive bacterial populations in sub-tropical marine fish. This is partly due to the fact that the selective media used for isolating Gram-positive bacteria have limitations. Ecological and speciation studies have revealed that the ecology and speciation of many Gram-positive bacteria have not been clearly elucidated. The effect of ambient storage on the individual genera and species of Gram-positive bacteria in fish has been rarely studied. The spoilage potential of Gram-positive bacteria of marine fish origin has not been clearly determined. Therefore, the main aims of this study were to isolate Gram-positive bacteria from fresh and ambient-temperature-stored sub-tropical marine fish, speciate the isolates and study the spoilage potential of the isolates. The practical components of this study were conducted in four parts. The first part dealt with validation of tryptone soya agar with 0.25% phenylethyl alcohol (PEA-TSA) to enumerate Gram-positive bacteria. The second part enumerated Gram-positive bacteria from the muscles, gills and gut of Pseudocaranx dentex (Silver Trevally), Pagrus auratus (Snapper) and Mugil cephalus (Sea Mullet) stored at 25&#61616;C for 15 hours using PEA-TSA. The third part dealt with the speciation of the isolates using appropriate methods such as polymerase chain reaction, 16S rRNA gene sequence, the VITEK JR system and conventional biochemical methods. In the fourth part, the isolates were assayed qualitatively for their ability to produce volatile sulphur compounds (VSC), reduce trimethylamine oxide and decarboxylate histidine, lysine and ornithine at mesophilic temperature, 32&#61616;C. Initial studies indicated that PEA-TSA significantly (P&lt; 0.05) reduced the total aerobic bacterial count of fish whereas control Gram-positive bacteria were not affected (P&gt; 0.05). Gram-positive aerobic bacterial counts (GABC) significantly (P&lt; 0.05) increased in the muscles and gills during ambient storage for 15 hours. Within each species, no significant (P&gt; 0.05) differences were found in GABC between muscles and gills. Moreover, there were no significant differences (P&gt; 0.05) in GABC between fish species during storage. In total, 390 bacteria were isolated from the fresh and stored fish; 339 isolates (87%) were found to be Gram-positive. Two hundred and sixty-six isolates (78%) of Gram-positive bacteria were identified to fall into 13 genera, namely Staphylococcus, Micrococcus, Bacillus, Virgibacillus, Brevibacillus, Corynebacterium, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Aerococcus, Exiguobacterium, Carnobacterium, Vagococcus and Sporosarcina and 30 species. In fresh fish, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Micrococcus luteus were the most frequent isolates. The effect of storage at 25&#61616;C for 15 hours resulted in a change of Gram-positive bacterial populations; while S. epidermidis, S. xylosus and Bacillus megaterium were no longer present, S. warneri, B. sphaericus, Brevibacillus borstelensis, Enterococcus faecium and Streptococcus uberis increased. Three species, E. faecium, Str. uberis and B. sphaericus, were the most prevalent at the end of storage. Micrococcus luteus and S. warneri were the most prevalent isolates from Pseudocaranx dentex, but E. faecium and Str. uberis were the most frequently isolated from Pagrus auratus and Mugil cephalus. With respect to different parts of the fish body, E. faecium, Str. uberis and B. sphaericus were the most frequent isolates from the muscles, E. faecium, Str. uberis from the gills and M. luteus from the gut. Among the 228 isolates examined, Br. borstelensis 73, Br. borstelensis 291, Str. uberis 339, Vagococcus fluvialis 31 and Vag. fluvialis 132 produced VSC from sodium thiosulphate, cysteine and methionine. However, strains varied in sulphur source utilization. Exiguobacterium acetylicum 5, Exiguobacterium spp. 191, Carnobacterium spp. 338, Br. borstelensis 73, Br. borstelensis 291, Str. uberis 30, Str. uberis 339, Vag. fluvialis 31 and Vag. fluvialis 132 reduced TMAO. No histidine decarboxylase activity was found in the Gram-positive bacterial species tested. Lysine and ornithine were decarboxylated mainly by different strains of S. warneri, S. epidermidis and M. luteus. During ambient storage of fish, the frequency of lysine-decarboxylating bacteria increased and became more diverse after 5 hours of storage. Among fish species examined, the frequencies of lysine- and ornithine-decarboxylating bacteria were higher and more diverse in Pseudocaranx dentex than in Pagrus auratus and Mugil cephalus. This study found that Gram-positive bacteria were abundant and diverse in sub-tropical marine fish; however, their frequencies were affected by fish habitat and fish body part. Ambient temperature storage determined which Gram-positive bacterial species were dominant. With the exception of one isolate of S. aureus, Gram-positive bacteria isolated from sub-tropical marine fish caught from unpolluted water were not potential pathogens. The study also showed that Gram-positive bacteria had greater ability to decarboxylate lysine and ornithine than to produce VSC or reduce TMAO, and the spoilage potential of a bacterial species was a strain-dependent behaviour. This is a significant study as it is the first study on this aspect sub-tropical marine fish. It validated a selective medium that can be used to enumerate most Gram-positive bacteria from a marine environment. Most of the Gram-positive bacterial species from sub-tropical marine fish identified in this study were documented for the first time. The effects of ambient storage and the spoilage potential of Gram-positive bacteria from sub-tropical marine were clearly elucidated.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ambient temperature, biogenic amines, conventional biochemical methods, decarboxylation, Gram-positive bacteria, mesophilic spoilage, phenylethyl alcohol, speciation, spoilage potential, sub-tropical marine fish</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:170768</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiological Responses to Acute Global Hypoxia and their Relationship to Brain Injury In the Newborn Piglet: What are the Important Responses?</field><field name="creator">Thomas Harris</field><field name="description">Perinatal asphyxia is a significant contributor to neonatal brain injury. In the clinical environment there is variability in the severity of neural injury in neonates with similar clinical histories. Whilst the duration and intensity of hypoxia is well known to influence the severity of neurological outcome, the global physiological responses to hypoxia may also affect the subsequent variability in neurological outcome. The first step in this project was to identify which physiological response/s during a constant global hypoxic-ischemic insult influence the severity of neurological outcome in the newborn piglet and to assess the relative importance of these responses. Hypoxia/hypercapnia was induced in anaesthetized piglets by reducing the fraction of inspired oxygen to 0.1 (10%) and the ventilation rate from 30-10 breaths per minute for 45 minutes. Neurological outcome was determined by using functional markers including aEEG amplitude and cerebral impedance, and the structural marker microtubule associated protein-2 immunohistochemistry at 6 hours post hypoxia. The results from the initial study indicated that there was significant variability in neurological outcome following a constant hypoxia/hypercapnia insult. Serum cortisol concentrations were highly variable at the end of hypoxia (mean &#177; SD; 240.7 &#177; 90.9 nmol/L) and associated with cardiovascular function (time heart rate below baseline; r = 0.69) and neurological outcome (r = 0.70). Cardiovascular function (time heart rate was below baseline) and neurological outcome were strongly associated (r = 0.77). In this study we observed an oscillating pattern in cardiovascular function during hypoxia in some animals. In the regression analysis variability in cortisol concentrations and cardiovascular function explained 68% of the variability in the severity of neurological outcome. Additional physiological factors did not improve the strength of the association with neurological outcome. The variability in the physiological responses, particularly cardiovascular and endocrine responses to hypoxia may be more important determinants of neurological outcome then previously recognised. Results from the initial study opened up several questions about the relationship between cortisol and cardiovascular function during hypoxia and the relationship to the subsequent neurological outcome. Since variability in cortisol concentrations was associated with both cardiovascular function and neurological outcome the second step of this thesis was to investigate what factors contributed to the variability in serum cortisol concentrations during hypoxia. It is important to understand why some individuals produce more cortisol than others, and as a result are protected against brain injury. The aim was to determine if the variability in serum cortisol concentrations was the result of variability in ACTH concentrations during acute global hypoxia. The results from this study showed that early changes in serum cortisol concentration (15 minutes) were not correlated with ACTH (R2 = 0.26, P = 0.1), however, later changes (30 &#8211; 45 minutes) were (R2 0.45 - 0.68). This suggests that the primary factor controlling serum cortisol concentrations before hypoxia and during later hypoxia is ACTH concentrations. These data suggest that other factors may control cortisol secretion during early hypoxia; a key mechanism responsible for these changes may be the activity of the sympathetic nervous system and the maturity of the adrenal medullae. Since, higher cortisol concentrations were associated with better cardiovascular function and neurological outcome. As a result of this observation the aim of this study was to determine if cortisol concentrations during hypoxia are the causative factor responsible for improved cardiovascular function and better neurological outcome. The results from this study showed that manipulating serum cortisol concentrations into high (&lt;500nmol/l) and low (&gt;50nmol/l) levels during hypoxia did not affect cardiovascular function (P = 0.68) or neurological outcome (P = 46). Within each group (low, high and control hypoxia group) there was significant variability in cardiovascular function during hypoxia, which was associated with neurological outcome. (r = -0.63, p = 0.01). This study showed that serum cortisol concentrations during hypoxia are not the causative factor impacting on improved cardiovascular function and neurological outcome. It is possible that factors affecting both cardiovascular function and cortisol production such as activity of the sympathetic nervous system, may be a possible mechanism behind the variability in neurological outcome and cardiovascular function. Additionally, this study showed that cortisol concentrations at 3 hours post hypoxia were associated with neurological outcome (r = -0.67, p = 0.01). The animals with poorer outcome may also be those with greater multi-organ damage and thus reduced ability to clear cortisol from the systemic circulation. In light of this finding it may be interesting to assess cortisol concentration in the human neonate at 3 hours post hypoxia and determine the relationship to neurological outcome. In the final study of this thesis the function of the cardiovascular system during hypoxia was investigated in more detail because of its strong association with neurological outcome (results observed in Chapter 2 and 4. Few researchers have reported on oscillations in cardiovascular function, particularly type-3 waves, during hypoxia in the neonate. The aim of this study was to determine the characteristics and occurrence of type-3 waves in the neonatal piglet and their relationship to neurological outcome following acute global hypoxia. The result showed that the development of type-3 waves in cardiovascular function occurred in 56% of animals. An oscillating pattern was significantly associated with better neurological outcome (p = 0.01) and a lower duration of hypotension during hypoxia (p = 0.02), and occurred more frequently in females (p = 0.024). The development of type-3 waves during acute global hypoxia is a key mechanism in promoting natural tolerance; and may be the result of greater activity, maturity or sensitivity of the sympathetic nervous system in females compared to males. This may explain the improved neurological outcome following hypoxia in the female neonate seen in the clinical setting.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cortsiol</field><field name="subject">cardiovascular function</field><field name="subject">neurological outcome</field><field name="subject">oscillations</field><field name="subject">sympathetic nervous system</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:170885</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theoretical Foundations for Practical &#8216;Totally Functional Programming&#8217;</field><field name="creator">Colin Kemp</field><field name="description">Interpretation is an implicit part of today&#8217;s programming; it has great power but is overused and has significant costs. For example, interpreters are typically significantly hard to understand and hard to reason about. The methodology of &#8220;Totally Functional Programming&#8221; (TFP) is a reasoned attempt to redress the problem of interpretation. It incorporates an awareness of the undesirability of interpretation with observations that definitions and a certain style of programming appear to offer alternatives to it. Application of TFP is expected to lead to a number of significant outcomes, theoretical as well as practical. Primary among these are novel programming languages to lessen or eliminate the use of interpretation in programming, leading to better-quality software. However, TFP contains a number of lacunae in its current formulation, which hinder development of these outcomes. Among others, formal semantics and type-systems for TFP languages are yet to be discovered, the means to reduce interpretation in programs is to be determined, and a detailed explication is needed of interpretation, definition, and the differences between the two. Most important of all however is the need to develop a complete understanding of the nature of interpretation. In this work, suitable type-systems for TFP languages are identified, and guidance given regarding the construction of appropriate formal semantics. Techniques, based around the &#8216;fold&#8217; operator, are identified and developed for modifying programs so as to reduce the amount of interpretation they contain. Interpretation as a means of language-extension is also investigated. Finally, the nature of interpretation is considered. Numerous hypotheses relating to it considered in detail. Combining the results of those analyses with discoveries from elsewhere in this work leads to the proposal that interpretation is not, in fact, symbol-based computation, but is in fact something more fundamental: computation that varies with input. We discuss in detail various implications of this characterisation, including its practical application. An often more-useful property, &#8216;inherent interpretiveness&#8217;, is also motivated and discussed in depth. Overall, our inquiries act to give conceptual and theoretical foundations for practical TFP.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="subject">interpretation</field><field name="subject">functional programming</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:171001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of developmental vitamin D3 deficiency on brain development, behaviour and immune function in the Sprague-Dawley rat</field><field name="creator">Louise Harvey</field><field name="description">Epidemiological evidence from season of birth and migrant studies has led to the proposal that developmental vitamin D3 (DVD) deficiency may be a risk factor for schizophrenia. Concurrently, there has been recent intense interest in vitamin D3 as a modifying factor in the development of immune responses. However, the effects of DVD deficiency on immune function remains unknown. Thus, a model of DVD deficiency has been developed in Sprague-Dawley rats. Briefly, female rats were maintained on a vitamin D3 deficient diet prior to and during gestation. At birth dams were returned to a vitamin D3 replete diet. Post-weaning their offspring, the DVD-deficient rats, were maintained on a vitamin D3 replete diet. Therefore, this model represents a transient, prenatal vitamin D3 deficiency. A number of structural and cellular changes have been described in the DVD-deficient rat brain, including ventriculomegaly, decreased growth factor expression, and increased rates of mitosis. These changes are correlated with altered adult behaviour in the DVD-deficient rat, including a locomotor sensitivity to novelty. This thesis will focus on extending these findings and characterising immune function in the DVD-deficient rat. Vitamin D3 can affect cellular differentiation and is anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic in many tissues including the brain. The effect of DVD deficiency on brain development has been restricted to neuronal cells in vivo and in vitro. However, the effect of this exposure on glial cell maturation and phenotype was unknown. The experiments reported in this thesis demonstrated that primary cortical glial cell cultures from DVD-deficient rat neonates displayed a similar phenotype and maturational status compared with cells from control rats. Learning and memory was examined in this model by exploring the phenomenon of latent inhibition. DVD-deficient rats displayed normal latent inhibition, however, they exhibited a subtle performance acquisition deficit during the early stages of the conditioned avoidance learning task. Extended handling and pre-exposure were able to ameliorate this deficit, though with this treatment normal latent inhibition was also abolished in both control and DVD-deficient rats. Ultrasonic vocalization and nociceptive threshold testing confirmed that alterations in peripheral sensation could not explain this performance acquisition deficit. The results suggested that anxiety or attentional mechanisms may have contributed to this rate of learning deficit. Finally, as vitamin D3 is a powerful immunoregulator, there is the potential for a transient DVD deficiency to induce a persistent alteration in the development and function of the immune system. This hypothesis was supported by findings that showed DVD deficiency resulted in a primed immune system, as indicated by an enlarged spleen, thymus and peripheral lymph tissue as well as increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production in response to an in vitro stimulation. However, these findings did not lead to an alteration in cell mediated immune response in vivo. The results from the research reported in this thesis indicate that a transient, prenatal vitamin D3 deficiency had a subtle yet significant effect on the immune system and behaviour of the adult rat. These findings add further weight to the body of evidence that link prenatal vitamin D3 status to various adverse health outcomes. The DVD-deficient rat model is an integral step in understanding prenatal vitamin D3 deficiency as a potential environment risk factor in the development of immune and psychiatric disorders.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-d3</field><field name="subject">vitamin D3</field><field name="subject">brain</field><field name="subject">immunity</field><field name="subject">behaviour</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">schizophrenia</field><field name="subject">Rat</field><field name="subject">animal model</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:171235</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chronic Effects of Antipsychotic Drugs on Pyramidal Cell Structure in Rat Anterior Cingulate Cortex: with relevance to schizophrenia</field><field name="creator">Dineshree Naiker</field><field name="description">Antipsychotic drugs (typical and atypical) are used in the treatment of mental disorders such as schizophrenia. Typical antipsychotic drugs (such as haloperidol) specifically target dopamine D2 receptors and produce extrapyramidal side effects. Atypical antipsychotic drugs (such as risperidone and olanzapine) primarily target dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT2A receptors and produce fewer extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) than do the typical antipsychotic drugs at clinically effective doses (Meltzer and Nash, 1991). It has been proposed that the prefrontal cortex (a brain region implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia) is the locus of antipsychotic drug action to improve cognitive dysfunction and negative symptoms of schizophrenia (Weinberger and Lipska, 1995; Jakab and Goldman-Rakic, 1998). Moreover, it is possible that the effects in the prefrontal cortex may contribute to the differences between typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs as well as differences among atypical antipsychotic drugs (Horacek et al., 2006). The core pathology associated with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex includes reduced cerebral volume, increased ventricle size and deficits in neuronal morphology, including increased cell packing density, reduction in dendrites and its associated dendritic spines (Selemon and Goldman-Rakic, 1999). However, since most neuropathology data emerge from in vivo imaging and post-mortem studies of patients with schizophrenia, it is difficult to interpret and distinguish between findings that have an etiological or iatrogenic basis. Thus, the objective of the current study was to examine the effects of antipsychotic drugs, at therapeutically relevant concentrations, in a rat brain region that is homologous to that of the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The hypothesis upon which this study was based is that haloperidol, risperidone and olanzapine (at 65 to 80% striatal dopamine D2 receptor occupancy) induce changes to pyramidal cell architecture in the rat anterior cingulate cortex (Vogt and Gabriel, 1993; Hoover and Vertes, 2007). This hypothesis was investigated by (a) determining doses that are within the therapeutic range (65 to 80% striatal dopamine D2 receptor occupancy) by measuring the occupancy of haloperidol, risperidone and olanzapine in the presence of 3H-raclopride ( a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist) at dopamine D2 receptors in the rat striatum; and (b) examining whether therapeutic doses of antipsychotic drugs in rats cause neuropathology comparable to that observed in human post-mortem brains of patients with schizophrenia. Antipsyhcotic drug doses were selected using an appropriate in vivo dopamine D2 receptor occupancy method. The findings from this study revealed that 0.25 mg/kg/day haloperidol, 5 mg/kg/day risperidone and 10 mg/kg/day olanzapine achieved therapeutically relevant rat striatal dopamine D2 receptor occupancy in the range of 65 to 80%. To determine whether antipsychotic drugs at therapeutic doses established above induce changes in neuronal cell density and morphology; immunohistochemistry, single cell injection of lucifer yellow dye and Golgi-Cox impregnation of layer II/III pyramidal cells was performed. The results from these experiments revealed that the density of cells expressing NeuN, parvalbumin, calretinin or calbindin is highly unlikely to be affected by chronic exposure to haloperidol, risperidone and olanzapine. The current study evaluated the effects of chronic antipsychotic drug exposure on spontaneous locomotor activity of a rat in a novel environment. The purpose of this study was to differentiate between a direct and an indirect drug effect. It was found that at the doses established above, risperidone and olanzapine did not overtly reduce spontaneous locomotor activity of a rat in a novel environment relative to controls. In contrast, haloperidol reduced spontaneous locomotor activity of rat in an open field, although this was not statistically significant. Nevertheless, the data reported here allowed us to conclude that the level of activity across groups is unlikely to affect the data obtained in subsequent studies investigating the effects of chronic antipsychotic drug treatment on pyramidal cell structure. Intracellular injection of lucifer yellow dye into pyramidal cells revealed that chronic haloperidol treatment (28 days) was associated with a relative increase in basal dendritic arborisation, but neither of these drug treatments induced changes in arborisation that were different from controls. No statistically significant change in the basal dendritic arbor was detected with animals treated with risperidone relative to controls. Similarly using the Golgi-impregnation method, changes in soma size, dendritic branching, total number of branches and the density of dendritic spines in antipsychotic drug treated groups were not significantly different to controls. Taken together, this finding indicates that only relatively subtle neuritic changes may be attributed to chronic treatment with typical or atypical antipsychotic drugs administered at doses that avhieved striatal dopamine D2 receptor occupancy in the range of 65 to 80%. In summary, this study confirms that antipsychotic drugs are unlikely to induce changes to neuronal cell density or morphology in the rat anterior cingulate cortex at therapeutically relevant doses. Hence, it can be concluded that the observed neuropathology, found in the brains of patients with schizophrenia that have undergone antipsychotic drug therapy, is more likely to be caused by the disease and not the effects of the concomitant drug therapy.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Antipsychotic Drugs</field><field name="subject">Pyramidal Cell</field><field name="subject">Structure</field><field name="subject">Rat</field><field name="subject">Anterior Cingulate Cortex</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:171313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Music, the Arts and the Dual Aesthetic in Seventeenth- and Early Eighteenth-Century English Thought</field><field name="creator">Barnaby Ralph</field><field name="description">This dissertation examines affect, rhetoric and aesthetics in relation to English thought of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, focusing in particular on music. It argues that a &#8220;dual aesthetic&#8221;, or a division in perception of an artistic experience between broad conceptions related to the intellectual and the sensual, was an implied discourse running through discussions of art, philosophy, music, education and other areas. I argue that both seventeenth- and eighteenth-century philosophers of the arts viewed the intellectual and sensual experiences as different things, and this distinction meant that they felt that an individual could perceive a painting, a work of music or another expression of artistic intent on two levels. A related division is between the macro-rhetorical, or broadly constructional, elements and the micro-rhetorical, or minutiae. In terms of music, ideas of affect and rhetoric were employed in three main ways in the period, given here in increasing order of their level of specific detail. The first was as concepts of general relation between different arts such as poetry, music and painting. Philosophical thought of the period held that the aim of any art was to move the passions and affections, and rhetoric was a template used to establish terms of discussion. The second way in which these ideas could be related to music was as general metaphors, such as the common metaphor of a piece as an oration. The third relation was on the constructional level, where ideas of musical affect were applied to instrumentation, rhythm, dynamics and other areas. Rhetoric served here as a specific constructional model, providing tools such as templates for the general structure of a work and figures that could be used in order to move the passions appropriately. The primary sources consulted are, for the most part, works either written in England, translated into English in the period, or well-known there during the seventeenth and the first half of the eighteenth century. Many of these were not concerned in the first instance with music, and explored instead aesthetics, philosophy or the arts in general. Such a contextual examination helps clarify terminological confusion, and many terms which have, for example, a musico-rhetorical function can thus be identified. There was no unified theory of affect and the passions, and certainly no definitive catalogue of musico-rhetorical devices in England in this period. Instead, this dissertation looks at commonalities of approach and the chronological development of affective and rhetorical elements in music. To this end, a wide range of sources have been discussed and contextualized, including works on classical rhetoric and its derivatives, education and medicine. General concepts are identified and information is then extrapolated from this. Ultimately, the elements combine in a hierarchy of construction, with overreaching principles coming from rhetoric, broad elements from affective theory and minutiae from both. The dual aesthetic, an implicit principle underlying seventeenth- and eighteenth-century thought about the arts, is thus made explicit in this dissertation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">music, affect, rhetoric, aesthetics, England, philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:171676</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pattern-Aware Prediction for Moving Objects</field><field name="creator">Hoyoung Jeung</field><field name="description">This dissertation challenges an unstudied area in moving objects database domains; predicting (long-term) future locations of moving objects. Moving object prediction enables us to provide a wide range of applications, such as traffic prediction, pre-detection of an aircraft collision, and reporting attractive gas prices for drivers along their routes ahead. Nevertheless, existing location prediction techniques are limited to support such applications since they are generally capable only of short-term predictions. In the real world, many objects exhibit typical movement patterns. This pattern information is able to serve as an important background to tackle the limitations of the existing prediction methods. We aims at offering foundations of pattern-aware prediction for moving objects, rendering more precise prediction results. Specifically, this thesis focuses on three parts. The first part of the thesis studies the problem of predicting future locations of moving objects in Euclidean space. We introduce a novel prediction approach, termed the hybrid prediction model, which utilizes not only the current motion of an object, but also the object's trajectory patterns for prediction. We define, mine, and index the trajectory patterns with a novel access method for efficient query processing. We then propose two different query processing techniques along given query time, i.e., for near future and for distant future. The second part covers the prediction problem for moving objects in network space. We formulate a network mobility model that offers a concise representation of mobility statistics extracted from massive collections of historical objects trajectories. This model captures turning patterns of the objects at junctions, at the granularity of individual objects as well as globally. Based on the model, we develop three different algorithms for predicting the future path of a mobile user moving in a road network, named the PathPredictors. The third part of the thesis extends the prediction problem for a single object to that for multiple objects. We introduce a convoy query that retrieves all groups of objects, i.e., convoys, from the objects' historical trajectories, each convoy consists of objects that have traveled together for some time; thus they may also move together in the future. We then propose three efficient algorithms for the convoy discovery, called the CuTS family, that adopt line simplification methods for reducing the size of the trajectories, permitting efficient query processing. For each part, we demonstrate comprehensive experimental results of our proposals, which show significantly improved accuracies for moving object prediction compared with state-of-the-art methods, while also facilitating efficient query processing.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Moving Objects Databases</field><field name="subject">Predictive Query Processing</field><field name="subject">Spatio-Temporal Data Mining</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:171706</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploiting the Internet for Teacher Professional Development and Mathematics Teaching and Learning: An Ethnographic Intervention</field><field name="creator">Sitti Maesuri Patahuddin</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT The purpose of this study was to investigate how primary teachers in Queensland, Australia can make use of the Internet for professional development and to enhance the teaching and learning of mathematics. As a result of this study, implications for using the Internet for the professional development of Indonesian mathematics teachers in primary schools were drawn. The genesis of the study had emerged from reflecting upon my personal experiences in using the Internet for my own professional learning, by exploring education phenomena related to the Internet in Indonesia and Australia, and identifying gaps in research as a result of my literature review. I argue that the Internet has potential as a medium for professional development and for teaching and learning mathematics. However, little is known about the personal and professional characteristics of teachers who use the Internet to promote and renew their professional knowledge and to support their on-going learning process as well as to be good facilitators for &#8216;new learners&#8217;. The literature review establishes the need for investigating how teachers can use the Internet for professional development and for teaching and learning mathematics. The literature review also examines the characteristics of effective professional development, identifies inadequacies in existing professional development programs, and examines the potential advantages and limitations of using the Internet for professional development. The review suggests that there is a need to build a new model of professional development to shed light on how the Internet might be used to support primary mathematics teacher professional development. In this study, two case studies have been conducted. The first case study was of a &#8216;high use Internet (HUI) teacher&#8217; (a teacher who intensively uses the Internet to sustain his/her professional growth as a mathematics teacher) and the second case study was of a &#8216;low use Internet (LUI) teacher&#8217; (a teacher who has not made use of the Internet for those main goals but has a willingness to do so). The researcher learned from the HUI teacher and formulated ways to help the LUI teacher. An ethnographic approach was chosen for this study, as the researcher went into the field for an extended period of time. This study employed multiple data gathering methods, namely: participant-observation, interviews, questionnaires, and written and non-written sources. The research reported in this thesis investigated factors (personal and contextual) that support or inhibit mathematics teachers in making use of the Internet for teacher professional development and for teaching mathematics. The findings support the notion that teachers&#8217; knowledge and beliefs are key determinants in embracing technology as a tool for teaching and learning. The findings are also significant in underscoring the non-linear, interactive and contingent nature of authentic professional development. The significance of this research is that it deepens our understanding about what is necessary for primary mathematics teachers to optimise the potential of the Internet for mathematics teaching and learning both for teachers and students. This study established the extent of the positive and negative potential effects of the Internet for professional development and the difficulties of using only this for professional development. Yet another significant outcome from this research is the construction of a theoretical framework for identifying the implications of using the Internet for professional development of Indonesian Primary teachers and for mathematics teaching and learning in Indonesian primary schools.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teacher professional development</field><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">low use Internet (LUI) teacher</field><field name="subject">high use Internet (HUI teacher)</field><field name="subject">zone theory</field><field name="subject">Indonesian context</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:171711</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Responses to Procedural Discrimination in Intragroup and Intergroup Contexts</field><field name="creator">Hak Land Grand Cheng</field><field name="description">To date, procedural justice research has paid little attention to how people react to procedural discrimination (favoring self vs. favoring other), that is, how people react when they and the others are treated with different procedures. To fill this gap in the procedural justice literature and advance our understanding in this area, the current thesis presents an analysis of how reactions to procedural discrimination are qualified by the group membership and intragroup position (ingroup prototypicality and intragroup status) of the parties involved in intragroup and intergroup contexts. Studies 1 and 2 revealed that in an intergroup context, as group members perceive ingroup bias as legitimate, they react more positively when they are favored over an outgroup member than when an outgroup member is favored over them. In particular, because group members perceive the ingroup authority to be more related to them, their reactions to favoring self as opposed to favoring other procedures are stronger when the authority is an ingroup member than when the authority is an outgroup member. Studies 3 to 5 showed that in an intragroup context, peripheral members, who are highly concerned about group acceptance, perceive a high level of illegitimacy and react particularly negatively when a prototypical member is favored over them. On the other hand, prototypical members paired with a prototypical or peripheral member, and peripheral members paired with another peripheral member react similarly to procedural discrimination whether it favors them or the other group member. Studies 6 and 7 also focused on the intragroup context. These studies revealed that when high status group members are favored over a low status member, if they perceive the status difference as legitimate, they perceive relatively high levels of procedural legitimacy and procedural fairness, and report a relatively low level of negative affect. On the other hand, when low status group members are discriminated against in favor of a high status counterpart, they report a relatively high level of negative affect even if they perceive the status difference as legitimate and think that the favoring other procedure is relatively legitimate and fair. Taken together, the current program of studies reveals that depending on group membership or intragroup position, group members may react differently to favoring self as opposed to favoring other procedures. Furthermore, affective reactions to the procedures may not be consistent with cognitive judgments of the procedures. The research also reveals that the influence of group membership and intragroup position on reactions to procedural discrimination can be conceptualized in terms of sensitivity to procedural information (Proposition 1) and perceived procedural legitimacy (Proposition 2), suggesting that the group-value model (Lind &amp; Tyler, 1988) and the social identity perspective (Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979; Turner, 1985; Turner et al., 1987; for a review, see Hogg, 2005, 2006) can help explain reactions to procedural discrimination. In conclusion, the current thesis makes significant contribution to the procedural justice literature.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Procedural Justice</field><field name="subject">Social Identity</field><field name="subject">Group Membership</field><field name="subject">Ingroup Prototypicality</field><field name="subject">Intragroup Status</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:171984</field></doc><doc><field name="title">With the voice of this calling: The experience of community development practitioners in the organisational context of bureaucracy</field><field name="creator">Lynda Shevellar</field><field name="description">This thesis aims to understand the experiences of community development practitioners who are located in the organisational context of bureaucracies. Over the last decade there has been a revitalised interest in community development as a means of addressing social issues within Australia. Local, state and federal governments, as well as large non-government organisations, have developed policies and programs aimed at building, strengthening, renewing and revitalising communities. At the same time, a set of ideologies have emerged that have given rise to a global neoliberal welfare regime, and that have shaped ways of thinking and behaving within bureaucracies. Whilst much has been written about these two broad trends and their impact upon Australia, what appears to be missing from these analyses is an understanding of the impact upon the actual practitioners operating at the intersection of these forces. This research addresses the gap in the literature between the academic discussion and the personal experience of undertaking community development in bureaucracies. This investigation adopts a qualitative approach. Twenty-two semi-structured interviews were conducted with community development practitioners from federal, state and local government and from large non-government organisations in Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). The interview transcripts were then analysed utilising a framework known as Causal Layered Analysis (CLA) which enabled the responses to be examined through multiple lenses: social, discursive and metaphoric. What this study reveals is that community development practitioners have a largely negative experience of bureaucracies: the work is difficult to do, it is not well understood, and it is not well supported. Whilst this is not particularly surprising, what IS of interest is the level of shock and frustration felt by practitioners, and their lack of preparedness for these experiences. Whilst community development workers have a very good understanding of the content of their practice, what appears to be missing is a critical analysis of their context and themselves as practitioners, and this invites a more negative experience of the work. Practitioners respond to these experiences by distinguishing between themselves as bureaucrats and what they name as their true and authentic selves. They articulate a difference between &#8220;working developmentally&#8221; from within bureaucracies and undertaking what they call &#8220;real&#8221; community development, which occurs &#8220;in community&#8221;. The acts of distinguishing an authentic self and authentic community development are both forms of resistance. However, I suggest that such constructions are largely unhelpful as they construct false binaries which render practitioners ineffective. The work of community development practitioners is compromised because the context in which they are operating is compromised. I also argue that community development students require greater preparation for the organisational context of bureaucracy, which includes understanding not only methodology, but also the objectives, arenas and structures for practice. Practitioners need a deeper understanding of relations of power within these contexts. This requires workers to be clear about their motivations, their commitment and their analysis. Finally I contend that what is required is the creation and sharing of metaphors that articulate a relational rather than individualistic and heroic form of agency. In this way community development theory and practice can shift away from a modernist narrative of development to a discussion of mutual transformation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">community development</field><field name="subject">bureaucracy</field><field name="subject">organisation</field><field name="subject">human agency</field><field name="subject">ideology</field><field name="subject">discourse</field><field name="subject">metaphor</field><field name="subject">myth</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:171994</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SUICIDAL TENDENCIES ONLINE: TAKING A HIGHWAY TO HELP OR CATCHING A BUS TO OBLIVION?</field><field name="creator">Keith Harris</field><field name="description">This study introduces empirical data essential to our understanding of the relationship between suicidal individuals and the internet. Strong support was found for hypotheses that suicidal individuals purposely use the internet to resolve suicidal problems, whether for life or for death, and actively engage in an internal suicidal debate. A computer-administered survey (N = 64), and a multinational online survey (N = 1016), provided data on suicide-risk factors, online help-seeking, and internet use. Results from the computer-administered survey showed negative problem-solving approach, using phone helplines, and reluctance to seek professional mental health services, predicted online help-seeking for suicidal ideation. Results from the online survey demonstrated suicide-risk individuals form a unique online population. Suicide-risk participants were more likely, than nonsuicidal, to use online forums, while suicide-risk females, compared to nonsuicidal females, were more likely to create original online content (e.g., blogs, social networking), and spend time surfing/browsing. Suicide-risk participants, particularly females, were more likely to go online in search of new interpersonal relationships (as evidenced by the author-developed Online Relationship Building scale), and demonstrated some acceptance of online help sources. Suicide surfers (suicide-risk individuals who reported going online for suicide-related purposes) were compared with suicide-risk online users (who did not report such experience). Suicide surfers were found to be a higher risk group, reporting more severe suicidal and depressive symptoms, and less social support. Surfers reported higher satisfaction with unmoderated online forums, compared with helpsites and online mental health professionals. Online, they also found more support, felt less alienated, and had more satisfying communications. Results showed strong support for the internal suicidal debate hypotheses. In addition, reasons for living and dying significantly differed between highly suicidal and not suicidal participants, and most highly suicidal participants reported using the internet to look for and/or confirm their reasons for living and dying. Implications include a need for helpsites to be more user and communication oriented. Research implications include new directions for exploring the spectrum of suicidal ideation, and further examining online suicide-related behaviors.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">suicide</field><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">online</field><field name="subject">help-seeking</field><field name="subject">problem-solving</field><field name="subject">social support</field><field name="subject">depression</field><field name="subject">debate</field><field name="subject">ideation</field><field name="subject">relationship</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:172066</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanism of glucocorticoid-mediated impairment of glucose transport in adipocytes</field><field name="creator">Sherry Ngo</field><field name="description">Glucocorticoids are widely used in clinical therapy. However, they cause adverse effects including insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes, which are characterised by decreased glucose transport into the muscles and fat. How glucocorticoids inhibit glucose transport remains unclear. Insulin stimulates glucose uptake via the insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 / phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) / protein kinase B (AKT) pathway and promotes the redistribution of GLUT4 from intracellular storage compartments to the plasma membrane (PM). Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of AKT substrate of 160 kDa (AS160), a Rab-GTPase activating protein is downstream of AKT and appears to be essential for exposure of GLUT4 at the PM and glucose uptake. This is mediated through the association of phosphorylated AS160 (at the key residue T642) with 14-3-3 in the cytosol. The mildly insulin-responsive GLUT1 mediates basal glucose uptake in adipocytes. It is also subject to regulated trafficking like GLUT4. This study aimed to determine the level at which glucocorticoids inhibit glucose uptake in adipocytes. Effects of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Dex) and the natural glucocorticoid cortisol, on GLUT1 and GLUT4 function were examined. Candidates for the glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of GLUT1- and GLUT4-mediated glucose uptake were investigated. These were glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3&#946; (an AKT substrate) for GLUT1-mediated glucose transport; and adaptor protein containing PH domain, PTB domain, and leucine zipper motif (APPL)-1 (an AKT-interacting protein) and AS160 for GLUT4-mediated glucose transport. Dex and cortisol significantly decreased basal glucose uptake by 50% (p&lt;0.05) in SGBS and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Similarly, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was decreased by 50% (p&lt;0.001 for SGBS; p&lt;0.05 for 3T3-L1) and 30% (p&lt;0.05 for both) at 1 nM and 100 nM insulin respectively. Similar results were observed with differentiated primary human preadipocytes and human adipose explants. Dex-mediated inhibition of basal glucose uptake was limited to insulin-sensitive cell types implying that glucocorticoids may regulate GLUTs at steps common to GLUT1 and GLUT4 trafficking. Dex-mediated reduction in glucose uptake correlated with the reduction in basal and insulin-stimulated expression of GLUT1 and GLUT4 to the PM without changes in total GLUT1/4 expression. Dex did not alter total expression or phosphorylation of proximal insulin-signalling molecules up to and including AKT but increased FOXO1 expression, and modified GSK3&#946;-S9 phosphorylation. Dex did not alter total APPL1 expression or subcellular distribution. Dex significantly decreased 1nM-insulin stimulated AS160-T642 phosphorylation by 50% (p&lt;0.05) in SGBS and 3T3-L1 adipocytes via the glucocorticoid repector (GR). This correlated with reduced AS160:14-3-3 interaction. Similar results were obtained for AS160-T642 basal phosphorylation. At 1nM insulin, AS160-T642 phosphorylation is maximal at sub-maximal glucose uptake, i.e. AS160 phosphorylation significantly contributes to glucose uptake. RU486 significantly prevented but did not fully abrogate the Dex-mediated reduction in glucose uptake suggesting additional Dex-induced defects. In conclusion, glucocorticoids inhibit glucose uptake at a level distal to AKT by GR-dependent mechanisms. A role for GSK3&#946; or APPL1 in glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of glucose uptake requires further investigations. FOXO1 represents a suitable candidate for mediating the Dex-induced defects. Of significance, perturbation in AS160-T642 phosphorylation contributes to Dex-mediated inhibition of glucose uptake. Thus, AS160 presents a novel therapeutic target in the improvement of glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of glucose uptake.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">glucocorticoids</field><field name="subject">adipocytes</field><field name="subject">glucose transporter</field><field name="subject">protein kinase b</field><field name="subject">foxo1</field><field name="subject">akt substrate of 160 kd</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:172156</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study of Sukkhavipassaka in P&#257;li Buddhism</field><field name="creator">Tzung-kuen Wen</field><field name="description">This thesis aims to explore the doctrine of sukkhavipassaka (&#8220;dry-insight practitioner&#8221;) in P&#257;li Buddhism. The focus of the thesis is to utilize the canonical and commentarial sources of the various Buddhist schools to evaluate the position of this doctrine in the history of early Buddhism. Since the early 20th century the sukkhavipassaka doctrine and its practice have been reemphasized by eminent meditation monks in Burma, and later they spread to other Buddhist countries in Asia and beyond. Some scholars, nevertheless, have cast doubts on the authenticity of the sukkhavipassaka doctrine. They argue that it is a later development, not recorded in the P&#257;li Nik&#257;yas since the form-sphere jh&#257;na (Skt. dhy&#257;na) is always necessary for the realization of arahantship, or even for stream-entry, the first stage of enlightenment. The first part of this thesis investigates the concept of the sukkhavipassaka in the four Nik&#257;yas. Many suttas in the P&#257;li Nik&#257;yas imply an acknowledgement of noble beings who lack form-sphere jh&#257;nas; also many meditative techniques described in the suttas can be practised in the so-called dry-insight way. However, it is in the P&#257;li commentarial literature, which is discussed in the second part of this thesis that the sukkhavipassaka doctrine appears in a full-fledged form. The P&#257;li commentaries not only specify the concentration that dry-insight practitioners use to develop insight knowledge, but also reveal the advantages and disadvantages of the dry-insight meditative approach. In the third part of this thesis, the canonical and commentarial materials related to the Sus&#299;ma Sutta which are preserved in schools other than the Therav&#257;da are investigated. This thesis reveals that the concept of arahants who lack the first form-sphere jh&#257;na is accepted not only by the Therav&#257;da but also by the Sarv&#257;stiv&#257;da, the *Satyasiddhis&#257;stra, and the Yogac&#257;rabh&#363;mi&#347;&#257;stra. Since various Buddhist schools in India unanimously advocate the idea that there are arahants who have not achieved the form-sphere jh&#257;na, this research concludes that the dry-insight meditative approach and dry-insight arahants are not an invention by Therav&#257;din commentators, but a common heritage which was most probably handed down from the time of the Buddha and then shared by various Buddhist schools.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">buddhist meditation, early buddhism, pali, vipassana, sukkhavipassaka, mindfulness meditation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:172205</field></doc><doc><field name="title">HIGH-RESOLUTION 40Ar/39Ar GEOCHRONOLOGY OF INTRAPLATE VOLCANISM IN EASTERN AUSTRALIA</field><field name="creator">Benjamin Cohen</field><field name="description">The time-space distributions of hotspot-derived volcanoes are widely utilised as a frame of reference for the motions of the Earth&#8217;s plates. In eastern Australia, hotspot-derived volcanoes of mid- to late-Cenozoic age (termed &#8216;central volcanoes&#8217;) are widespread, occurring over a north-south distance of nearly 2000 km. Previous geochronologic results from these central volcanoes indicate a fast northward velocity of the Australian plate of 65 &#177; 3 km.Ma-1 over the last 32 million years, relative to a fixed hotspot. In this project, 40Ar/39Ar geochronology is used to date 87 samples from central volcanoes in eastern Australia, revealing new details of Australia&#8217;s dynamic volcanic and tectonic history. The 40Ar/39Ar ages confirm that mafic activity at individual central volcanoes typically occurs over a time span of three to five million years and reveal that the silicic rocks were emplaced within one million years or less towards the end of this lifespan. As such, the silicic rocks provide consistent markers in the history of central-volcano activity, allowing detailed age comparisons to be made between volcanoes. Using this approach, age progressions for east Australian volcanism can be resolved over time windows as short as a few million years. The time-space distribution of the silicic rocks indicates the northward velocity of the Australian plate has not been constant throughout the Cenozoic. A major reduction in northward plate velocity down to 263 +5 km.Ma-1 is indicated between 26-23 Ma from the ages of volcanoes in southeastern Queensland. This reduction in plate velocity was accompanied by a clockwise rotation of the plate, as shown by sigmoidal bends in the Tasmantid and Lord Howe hotspot chains in the Tasman Sea. An earlier period of slower plate velocity is also interpreted between 30-29 Ma from the ages of volcanoes in central Queensland. Both the 30-29 and 26-23 Ma periods can be correlated to major collision events in New Guinea and Ontong Java, respectively, which changed the subduction tectonics along the northern plate boundary. These velocity changes also appear to have affected the characteristics of volcanism, with larger overlapping volcanoes constructed during periods of slower plate velocity. Crustally derived rhyolites were also produced from volcanoes erupted between 26-23 Ma, and possibly also 30-29 Ma. This is in contrast to volcanoes erupted during periods of fast plate velocity, where silicic rocks are the differentiation products of mantle-derived magmas, with only minor crustal contributions. The implication is that the slower plate velocity - and hence longer period - vii - of time over the mantle thermal anomaly - promoted the construction of larger, more voluminous volcanoes, and facilitated more efficient heating and melting of the crust. 40Ar/39Ar geochronology was also undertaken on two other styles of intraplate volcanism in eastern Australia: leucitites and lava fields. Ages for seven leucitites from southeastern Australia confirm that these potassic ultramafic rocks become younger to the south, at a similar time and rate to the nearby central volcanoes. As such, the 40Ar/39Ar results are consistent with a hotspot-related origin for the leucitites. Eighteen lava field samples were analysed, revealing that many of these rocks contain excess argon or have experienced argon loss, and indicating that at least some of the scatter in ages currently identified in these volcanoes is due to inaccurate K-Ar ages.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:172219</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficient Calibration and Predictive Error Analysis for Highly-Parameterized Models Combining Tikhonov and Subspace Regularization Techniques</field><field name="creator">Matthew James Tonkin</field><field name="description">The development and application of environmental models to help understand natural systems, and support decision making, is commonplace. A difficulty encountered in the development of such models is determining which physical and chemical processes to simulate, and on what temporal and spatial scale(s). Modern computing capabilities enable the incorporation of more processes, at increasingly refined scales, than at any time previously. However, the simulation of a large number of fine scale processes has undesirable consequences: first, the execution time of many environmental models has not declined despite advances in processor speed and solution techniques; and second, such complex models incorporate a large number of parameters, for which values must be assigned. Compounding these problems is the recognition that since the inverse problem in groundwater modeling is non-unique the calibration of a single parameter set does not assure the reliability of model predictions. Practicing modelers are, then, faced with complex models that incorporate a large number of parameters whose values are uncertain, and that make predictions that are prone to an unspecified amount of error. In recognition of this, there has been considerable research into methods for evaluating the potential for error in model predictions arising from errors in the values assigned to model parameters. Unfortunately, some common methods employed in the estimation of model parameters, and the evaluation of the potential error associated with model parameters and predictions, suffer from limitations in their application that stem from an emphasis on obtaining an over-determined, parsimonious, inverse problem. That is, common methods of model analysis exhibit artifacts from the propagation of subjective a-priori parameter parsimony throughout the calibration and predictive error analyses. This thesis describes theoretical and practical developments that enable the estimation of a large number of parameters, and the evaluation of the potential for error in predictions made by highly parameterized models. Since the focus of this research is on the use of models in support of decision making, the new methods are demonstrated by application to synthetic applications, where the performance of the method can be evaluated under controlled conditions; and to real-world applications, where the performance of the method can be evaluated in terms of trade-offs in computational effort versus calibration results and the ability to rigorously yet expediently investigate predictive error. The applications suggest that the new techniques are applicable to a range of environmental modeling disciplines. Mathematical innovations described in this thesis focus on combining complementary regularized inversion (calibration) techniques with novel methods for analyzing model predictive error. Several of the innovations are founded on explicit recognition of the existence of the calibration solution and null spaces &#8211; that is, that with the available observations there are some (combinations of) parameters that can be estimated; and there are some (combinations of) parameters that cannot. The existence of a non-trivial calibration null space is at the heart of the non-uniqueness problem in model calibration: this research expands upon this concept by recognizing that there are combinations of parameters that lie within the calibration null space yet possess non-trivial projections onto the predictive solution space, and these combinations of parameters are at the heart of predictive error analysis. The most significant contribution of this research is the attempt to develop a framework for model analysis that promotes computational efficiency in both the calibration and the subsequent analysis of the potential for error in model predictions. Fundamental to this framework is the use of a large number of parameters, the use of Tikhonov regularization, and the use of subspace techniques. Use of a large number of parameters enables parameter detail to be represented in the model at a scale approaching true variability; the use of Tikhonov constraints enables the modeler to incorporate preferred conditions on parameter values and/or their variation throughout the calibration and the predictive analysis; and, the use of subspace techniques enables model calibration and predictive analysis to be undertaken expediently, even when undertaken using a large number of parameters. This research focuses on the inability of the calibration process to accurately identify parameter values: it is assumed that the models in question accurately represent the relevant processes at the relevant scales so that parameter and predictive error depend only on parameter detail not represented in the model and/or accurately inferred through the calibration process. Contributions to parameter and predictive error arising from incorrect model identification are outside the scope of this research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">calibration, parameter estimation, uncertainty, predictive error, regularization, Tikhonov, TSVD, pilot points, subspace methods, Monte Carlo</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:172274</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interorganizational Collaboration Characteristics and Outcomes: A case study of the Jeddah Festival</field><field name="creator">Samer Yaghmour</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the question &#8216;How and why does collaboration influence the outcomes of stakeholders in the Jeddah Festival?&#8217; Past research has found that a number of characteristics of stakeholder collaboration are important in achieving desired group and individual outcomes. While these studies have identified various relationships between individual characteristics and selected outcomes, there has been little research on their relative importance and interaction. Within the events literature, the characteristics of inter-organization stakeholder collaboration, the different outcomes required from this collaboration and the correlation between characteristics and outcomes have received little attention. This research addresses this gap and examines the perceptions of event stakeholders regarding the characteristics of collaboration and the collaborative outcomes perceived as important. It also explores the differences in collaborative characteristics and outcomes for stakeholder salience groups. In particular it applies a single case study design to examine the interaction between the collaboration characteristics and outcome for stakeholders involved in the Jeddah Festival held annually in Jeddah Saudi Arabia. The research uses content analysis of transcribed interviews conducted with Jeddah Festival stakeholder&#8217;s to identify the characteristics of stakeholder collaboration and collaborative outcomes. Results indicate that governance and trust were the characteristics of collaboration with the highest frequencies during interviews. Outcomes of collaboration were identified at the individual and collective level with network development, resources and social capital most frequently mentioned. A correlation analysis between characteristics and outcomes using a Spearman rank correlation identified that governance and trust were the characteristics with the most significance for achieving both individual and collective outcomes. Stakeholder salience groups were found to differ in the frequency of mention of both characteristics and outcomes. The research found that the nature of the collaborative environment is positive in part due to the initial legitimatization process and also to survivor bias. Overall these findings provide evidence of the interaction between stakeholder collaboration characteristics and outcomes in the Jeddah Festival and provide guidance for how this collaboration may be improved.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">collaboration</field><field name="subject">outcomes</field><field name="subject">stakeholders</field><field name="subject">events</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">saudi arabia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:172280</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Starch microstructure and functional properties in waxy rice (Oryza sativa L.)</field><field name="creator">Rosa Cuevas</field><field name="description">Rice starch contains two types of glucose polymers, mainly linear amylose and hyper-branched amylopectin. Waxy rice has been characterised by the lack of amylose, the proportion of which being one of the most important parameters measured for rice quality. Germplasm collection work conducted in the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic has previously demonstrated the diversity of this type of rice in terms of quality. The definition of a waxy rice variety is dependent on the meaning of amylose. The conventional method for determining amylose content has shown that waxy rice could have up to 5% amylose. However, including a 0% amylose standard in the standard curve causes the amylose content of these varieties to become 0-2%. In this work, the absence of amylose in waxy rice has been determined through three different approaches. Granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSS1), the enzyme which synthesises amylose, was not detected in waxy rice. Long linear chains associated with amylose were also not detected by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The absence of these long chains affected functional properties of waxy rice, as indicated by the differences in viscosity curves between waxy and non-waxy rice. Moreover, these waxy varieties themselves exhibit differences in their viscosity curves, another indication of the diversity in coking properties in these varieties. A new approach, the &#8216;lnP(N) technique&#8217;, in analysing chain length distributions was applied to varieties with known mutations in two of the enzymes involved in the synthesis of amylopectin, and in determining gelatinisation temperature. It was determined that the presence of a novel feature, an interruption to linearity at DP 18-24, of the lnP(N) plot was found in rice samples with mutations in the alk gene, which codes for starch synthase (SS) IIa, and in samples with inactive branching enzyme (BE) IIb. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene coding for SSIIa have been associated with lowered gelatinisation temperature. On the other hand, non-functionality of BEIIb changes the amylopectin structure such that gelatinisation temperature is increased. The novel feature of the lnP(N) plot is found when either or both SSIIa and BEIIb are non-functional. Waxy rice starch has hot-water-soluble (HWS) and insoluble (HWI) components. It has been confirmed that the soluble polysaccharides are structurally different from phytoglycogen, and are similar to amylopectin. Structural differences between the two fractions, which can account for their differences in solubility, were determined. At the level of the chain length distribution, the HWI fraction contained long chains not found in the HWS fraction. Considerable amounts of sucrose and glucose were found in the HWS fraction. At another level of structure, the degree of branching of the HWS components was higher than in the HWI fraction. On the other hand, the whole molecules of the HWS fraction were smaller than those of the HWI fraction. These structural differences between the two fractions potentially affected their physical behaviour, particularly solubility. The amount of leached material appears to be a property of the method, as varying cooking conditions changed the amount of HWS components. This amount reaches equilibrium at certain conditions, indicating the limited amount of the HWS material. On the other hand, the HWI component contains molecules that are insoluble in water, rather than molecules that solubilise slowly. Given the stability of the HWS fraction in solution, the ratio of the HWS fraction to the HWI fraction could potentially be used in measuring quality if the amount of the HWS fraction is variety-specific. However, the quantity of the HWS fraction appears to be a feature of the starch, rather than of the variety. Nevertheless, the fact that the soluble fraction is structurally and thermodynamically different from the insoluble fraction could presumably be grounds to classify the soluble component as a group of molecules distinct from amylopectin.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">waxy rice</field><field name="subject">starch structure</field><field name="subject">chain length distribution</field><field name="subject">molecular weight</field><field name="subject">rice quality</field><field name="subject">amylopectin</field><field name="subject">size exclusion chromatography</field><field name="subject">fluorophore-assisted capillary electrophoresis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:172296</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nozzle optimization study and measurements for a quasi-axisymmetric scramjet model</field><field name="creator">Katsuyoshi Tanimizu</field><field name="description">The overall performance of a scramjet-powered vehicle not only depends on the performance of individual components but also on how the components interact with one another. Because scramjet engines must be integrated into the vehicle design, the optimization of the design of one component may detrimentally offset the performance of other components. This thesis addresses the optimization of the thrust nozzle of a scramjet-powered vehicle and shows how the optimization must include the integration of the nozzle into the overall vehicle design. The basic scramjet vehicle configuration chosen for the study is the somewhat conventional design of a vehicle with an axisymmetric centrebody, where fuel and payload may be stored, and a quasi-axisymmetric cowl. Six internal intake-combustor-nozzle modules are arranged around the centrebody. Paull et al. (1995) tested a configuration of this type (referred to as model 0) and demonstrated that, at some conditions, a net positive thrust could be produced. They suggest that the thrust nozzle of the vehicle has potential for design change that could lead to significantly improved performance. The main aim of the present study is to test this hypothesis. An important decision that was made early in the present project was that the research would focus on unfuelled operation of the vehicle design. This still allowed the influence of integration of the optimized nozzle to be studied but removed the complications introduced by combustion processes. In order to integrate optimization of design of the thrust nozzle, it was necessary to analyze the performance of the complete scramjet vehicle design. A simple analysis methodology that captures the important physical processes occurring in the flow through and around the vehicle is necessary so that rapid calculations can be made in an iterative optimization program. Therefore, the force prediction methodology that was developed used a combination of simple hypersonics theories and inviscid 3-D CFD modelling instead of using a full 3-D Navier-Stokes equation solver to minimize the calculation time. The pressure forces and viscous forces on the model were calculated separately for each component of the scramjet vehicle designs. The theory of van Driest (1956) for skin friction drag in turbulent boundary layers was found to produce best agreement with measurements. Therefore, it was employed to estimate the turbulent skin friction drag in the present research. To validate the current force prediction methodology, the net axial drag force on an unfuelled quasi-axisymmetric scramjet model derived from the design of Paull et al. (1995) and designed for operation at Mach 6 (model 1) was measured in the T4 Stalker tube at The University of Queensland using a single component Stress Wave Force Balance. (The design of Paull et al. (1995) is referred to here as model 0.) Tests were performed with Mach 6, Mach 8, and Mach 10 nozzles attached to the end of the shock tube. In order to get a wide range of flow conditions the nozzle-supply enthalpy was varied from 3 to 10 MJ/kg and the nozzle-supply pressure from 35 to 45 MPa. A reduction of the drag coefficient of model 1 was observed with decreasing nozzle-supply enthalpy for each of the tunnel nozzles tested. The performance of model 1 was analyzed using the force prediction methodology. Generally, the force prediction results were in good agreement with experimental results. The results indicate that the internal intakes provide 50% of the total drag. The skin friction drag in the combustion chambers and the nozzles account for 30% of the total drag. In order to investigate the influence on the overall performance of the vehicle obtained by improving the nozzle performance, optimization and parametric studies of quasi-axisymmetric scramjet nozzle designs were conducted. The vehicle which was optimized in this study is of a similar configuration to the model used in Paull et al. (1995). The vehicles are optimized for minimum fuel-off net axial drag for a design flight Mach number of 8 using the force prediction methodology and the Nelder and Mead (1965) optimization algorithm. The optimization studies focused on the combustion chamber and the nozzle. Therefore, the shape of the conical forebody and the intake were not changed. The external flow over the cowl was taken into account during the optimization studies. The results showed that a long nozzle with a large external cowl deflection angle, which allowed the nozzle area ratio to be increased, did not give better performance than a short nozzle with a smaller area ratio. This was due to the competing effects of increased external drag on the cowl and increased nozzle thrust as the nozzle area ratio increased. The optimum shape gave limited improvement compared with that of Paull et al. (1995). While fuelled performance of the vehicle was not the focus of the present investigation, a preliminary theoretical study of fuelled operation was performed. A parametric study to vary the nozzle length and external cowl deflection angle was performed for different flight Mach numbers. The results indicate a larger nozzle and higher external cowl deflection angle are appropriate for fuelled cases compared with unfuelled cases. The net axial force on a model with a geometry close to the optimum design (model 2) was measured in the T4 shock tunnel in order to check that the optimization procedure was valid. Model 2 showed generally better performance than other models experimentally. For the Mach 6 nozzle tests, although model 2 has some performance losses due to the spillage of flow around the intakes, model 2 shows approximately a 20% lower drag coefficient than model 1 and shows slightly better performance than model 0. For all test conditions, a break-down of the components of the drag coefficient indicates that the nozzle of model 2 produces approximately three times more thrust than the nozzle of model 0 and approximately twice more than that of model 1. For the Mach 8 nozzle tests, model 2 has approximately a 20% lower drag coefficient than model 1. However, for the Mach 10 nozzle tests, no significant differences between the models were observed in the measurements. Finally, the measurements and optimization study indicate that when model 2 is fuelled, it could be expected to be capable of cruise up to Mach 8 because of its very effective nozzle.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Scramjets</field><field name="subject">Optmization</field><field name="subject">Force Measurements</field><field name="subject">Flow visualization</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:172413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pentecostalism in Urban Java: a Study of Religious Change, 1980-2006</field><field name="creator">Mark Robinson</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the reasons for religious change to Pentecostal Christianity in urban Java during the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. It investigates the conversion trend to Pentecostal forms of Christianity that has taken place in recent decades in the cities of Java. Why some of Java&#8217;s Muslim urbanites, particularly young traditionalist Javanese Muslims of lower and middle class status, have converted to this ecstatic expression of Christianity since 1980 is the focus of this study. The thesis considers the utility of current social science theories that emphasise social, cultural, political and selected religious factors, to understanding this conversion trend in urban Muslim Java. Socio-political factors, particularly political and social crises, rapid urbanisation, and state support for monotheistic religions; and selected religious factors, mainly delimited religious pluralism and reaction to Islamic extremism, produced a climate in urban Java conducive to conversion to this indigenous, moderately strict, this-worldly focussed and modern Christian movement. While this thesis demonstrates the utility of current social science explanations, it argues that these explanations, which rely solely on socio-political and some religious factors external to the converts, do not fully explain why some of the Muslim inhabitants of the cities of Java have converted to Pentecostal Christianity over other religions, and over other forms of Christianity. I argue that existing social science theory be extended to be more inclusive of specialised aspects of the Pentecostal movement. These specific characteristics are considered under the schema of &#8216;religious experiences and movement specificities&#8217; (REMS), and are particularly concerned with the role of Pentecostal worldview, religious experiences, community and institutional aspects in conversion. This thesis demonstrates the value of an integrated approach to the scientific study of the reasons for religious conversion, one that considers the contribution of external socio-political forces and inner subjective religious experiences, personal faith aspects and specificities of movements.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Java</field><field name="subject">Urban</field><field name="subject">Pentecostal</field><field name="subject">Christianity</field><field name="subject">Islam</field><field name="subject">conversion</field><field name="subject">religion</field><field name="subject">social science</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:172822</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Drug and Alcohol Prevention among Culturally Diverse Northern Australian Adolescents: An Investigation of a School Drug and Alcohol Prevention Program for Year 8 Students</field><field name="creator">Nicki Gazis</field><field name="description">This dissertation explored a number of themes associated with adolescent drug and alcohol prevention among culturally diverse Northern Australian adolescents. It was undertaken because important differences are often associated with specific cultural groups and local knowledge is often needed as a means of informing effective prevention programs. Five studies are presented, each, with its own hypotheses, results and conclusions that examine influences on the common dependent variable of adolescent substance use. In consultation with teachers a new universal school-based drug and alcohol prevention program was developed addressing the four most commonly used substances among Australian adolescents, namely alcohol, cigarettes, cannabis and inhalants. The program was predicated on the social influence and alcohol harm minimisation models and was successful in reducing alcohol initiation and increasing cannabis and inhalant refusal self-efficacy among non-initiates. Program delivery is equally as important and program content and prevention programs utilising interactive teaching have been found to be more effective in preventing adolescent substance use than those delivered in a didactic or non-interactive style. The implementation evaluation found that teachers delivered less of the interactive program contents (49%) compared with the non-interactive components (84%). Quality of program delivery may have explained the limited efficacy of the school program to reduce cigarette use and to deter use among those who had already initiated substance use. Additionally three descriptive studies explored variables representing risk and protection for adolescent substance use. Key finding were that cultural identity was observed to be protective of both Indigenous and Non-Indigenous alcohol initiation but was associated with risk for Indigenous youth who had any number of drinking friends; that drinking parents had a strong direct effect on adolescent drinking independent of friends&#8217; use; and a lack of school connectedness was associated with increased adolescent smoking and drinking. This dissertation demonstrated that a school drug education program in its self cannot effectively prevent adolescent drug use. While improvements can be made to current teaching practices, school curricula need to be supplemented with multi-modal programs that aim to selectively reduce parental substance use and improve the school experience for all students.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">: school drug and alcohol prevention, cultural differences, cultural identity, peer influence, parental substance use, school connectedness</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:172891</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crystallization Studies on a Bacillus licheniformis Alpha-amylase</field><field name="creator">Alex Chan</field><field name="description">Proteins are important biological products with unique functions, annually produced at the hundreds of millions of dollars value on a worldwide basis. The application of crystallization for these materials primarily was led by structural biologists and crystallographers who are keen on obtaining large and well-ordered crystals for protein structure determination via X-ray diffraction. Usually for this, crystallization is done on a small scale by vapor diffusion using a supersaturated solution of the material. In the past decades, production crystallization has slowly received increasing attention for the large-scale recovery of proteins. Among the numerous products, an industrial enzyme (alpha-amylase) that is extensively involved in food processing and laundry products was chosen for examination due to the lack of relevant data in the literature and the potential industrial interest in crystallizing this material. The chosen alpha-amylase is a product of Genencor International (the Danisco division) and is derived from a genetically modified Bacillus licheniformis. In parallel to the underlying principles that govern the bulk crystallization of small molecules, the broad topics of investigation for this macromolecular material included determination of solubility, studies of nucleation thresholds, and investigation of crystal growth kinetics and special phenomena accompanying the crystallization process. All these studies were preceded by a series of characterization tests conducted for the material. On the whole, this study aimed to extend the existing fundamental knowledge of bulk crystallization for biological macromolecules. Specifically, it intended to enrich the solubility and crystallization kinetic data for the alpha-amylase. The experimental data of this study were all obtained at conditions in line with industrial practice, which included the use of moderate temperatures, mild pH conditions and simple inorganic salts ((NH4)2SO4, Na2SO4 and NaCl) in order for the findings to be transferred to the industry directly. In a 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (with no added salts), alpha-amylase solubility increased with solvent temperature and had a minimum at pH between 6.4 and 7.1. A generalized equation (as a function of pH and temperature) was obtained to correlate the data. The three inorganic salts examined affected the alpha-amylase solubility in a different manner, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Evidently, the interaction effect of a salt varied with solution pH. This confirms the importance of studying solubility with the two or more condition parameters at the same time. With relevance to crystal growth, the metastable region of the material was relatively wide at (NH4)2SO4 and Na2SO4 concentrations corresponding to maximum solubility. For example, &#963;SNT was 1.2 &#61617; 0.2 in solutions with 5 wt% ammonium sulfate at pH 7.0 and 25oC. A wide metastability range is useful for the practical operation of batch crystallizers as nucleation can be minimized. This range, however, diminished as the salt concentration increased beyond the maximum solubility points, imposing a limit on the range of salt concentration favorable for growth processes. In systems with no added salts at pH 7.0, the solution metastability was slightly higher at 10oC than at 40oC. This would suggest a future further examination of the salt system at a lower temperature, say of 10oC. To develop a batch crystallizer, the growth kinetic data of the material have to be known. Throughout the growth studies, the alpha-amylase crystals obtained were lozenge-shaped thin plates. Apparently, habit was not influenced by the crystallization conditions chosen. Similar to other proteins crystallized in bulk, the growth rate of alpha-amylase demonstrated a second-order dependence upon supersaturation. Importantly, the alpha-amylase demonstrated crystal growth rate dispersion (GRD) under all the conditions tested. To simplify the analysis of growth kinetic results, the seed crystals used were common history (CH) seeds whose growth rates are proportional to their sizes. The spread of growth rates (CV) was 0.54 for the unsieved CH seeds used. Due to GRD, growth rate coefficient data varied with crystal size. For instance, in solutions containing 5 wt% ammonium sulfate at pH 7.0 and 25oC, the growth rate coefficient for seed crystals initially at 20 &#61549;m was 2.47 &#61549;m/hr. This order of magnitude was equivalent to that of many other proteins. Although being small, industrial crystallization was feasible with these kinetics, as demonstrated by the sample design calculations included. To improve the design, it is recommended to further examine the solubility, metastability and growth kinetics of the above system at other temperatures to obtain a wider growth rate range. As the important phenomenon of growth rate dispersion has seldom been examined for protein and enzyme materials in the crystallization literature, this study is a significant contribution to this area.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Crystallization</field><field name="subject">Crystallizer</field><field name="subject">Macromolecules</field><field name="subject">Industrial enzymes</field><field name="subject">Bacillus licheniformis alpha-amylase</field><field name="subject">Solubility phase diagram</field><field name="subject">Nucleation thresholds</field><field name="subject">Metastability</field><field name="subject">Crystal growth kinetics</field><field name="subject">Growth rate dispersion</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:173386</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical Simulation of a Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Reservoir in the Cooper Basin, South Australia</field><field name="creator">Bronwyn Muller</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the development and production of numerical simulations of the creation of a Hot Dry Rock (HDR) geothermal reservoir. This geothermal reservoir that was simulated is owned by Geodynamics Limited and is located in the Cooper Basin, South Australia. The simulations show the geometry of the geothermal reservoir and predict the productive lifespan of the reservoir. Geothermal energy, which is the thermal energy that is stored in the interior of the earth, is an enormous energy source and as such there is great interest in technology that allows this energy to be harnessed. The HDR process of extracting the geothermal energy from rock involves drilling a borehole to a suitable depth and injecting cold water into the rock via this well (known as the injection well) to create a reservoir by opening up fractures in the rock. As water is forced through the reservoir, heat is extracted from the rock via conduction and transferred to the water, creating an heat exchange. Warm water is brought to the surface via another well known as the extraction well. The heat from the water is used to generate electricity and then the water is fed back into the injection well, completing the cycle. The creation of a HDR geothermal reservoir comprises of many aspects: the injection of the fluid into the jointed rock system, the opening and shearing of the joints, the creation of the fluid reservoir in the rock and the temperature effects of the fluid flow through the joints. This work incorporates all of these aspects. Due to the multi-physics nature of this process multiple computational modelling strategies were implemented to allow for authentic simulation of the entire process. The mechanical rock behaviour was primarily simulated the Distinct Element Method. This two dimensional Distinct Element Method program allowed for a realistically scaled model of the whole geothermal reservoir to be developed. This model was particularly useful for modelling the joint behaviour as the discrete nature of this method compares well with the joint system on such a scale. A discrete particle based model was used to model the joint behaviour on a small scale. These models demonstrated the behaviour of joints under compressional strain, showing slip and the effects of joint dilatancy. The productive lifespan of the geothermal reservoir was modelled using a Finite Element Method program based on Darcy's Law and an height-averaged heat equation. The aim of this model was to simulate the effects on the rock temperature of the fluid flow through the reservoir. The lifespan of the reservoir with differing well geometries was tested using this model to show which geometry would extend the productive lifetime of the geothermal reservoir. The results produced from the DEM models showed that the reservoir geometry is very much dependent upon the joint angle, and under the Cooper Basin stress regime steeper joints will be more likely to open. Joint dilatancy also affects the fluid flow rates as the amount of joint opening is dependent upon the joint dilatancy angle. The modelling of the temperature drawdown of the rock due to the fluid flow showed that a square configuration of wells is the ideal configuration to prolong the productive lifespan of the HDR geothermal reservoir. Results produced with the modelling parameters provided by Geodynamics Limited indicate that the productive lifespan of the Cooper Basin HDR geothermal reservoir created is approximately 50 years. This reservoir is only one of many that can be created at the site to prolong the productivity of the energy plant. The combined results of this modelling strategy give an overall image of the creation and lifetime of the HDR geothermal energy plant in the Cooper Basin.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260000 Earth Sciences</field><field name="subject">HDR</field><field name="subject">geothermal</field><field name="subject">Cooper Basin</field><field name="subject">Geodynamics</field><field name="subject">finite element</field><field name="subject">distinct element</field><field name="subject">Escript</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:173606</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exocytosis and Endocytosis in LPS-activated macrophages: pathways and regulators</field><field name="creator">Daniele Sangermani</field><field name="description">During inflammatory responses, macrophages make and secrete cytokines, including the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha (TNF). TNF is a highly potent activator of immune responses with pleiomorphic effects throughout the body. TNF is a key causative agent of chronic inflammatory diseases and is of an intense clinical interest as a therapeutic target. At the outset of this thesis, little was known about how macrophages secrete TNF. Notably, the pathways, carriers and molecules that regulate TNF secretion had not been characterised. A main goal of this work was to identify compartment and molecules involved in the intracellular trafficking of TNF. Live cell imaging of GFP-TNF was established and this provided novel and important new insights into trafficking. Both endogenous and GFP-tagged TNF were followed in macrophages using fluorescence microscopy. The trafficking of other molecules in macrophages was also studied. The major findings of this work include the identification of a new two-step secretory pathway for TNF and other proteins from the trans-Golgi Network (TGN) to the cell surface. This pathway goes via the recycling endosome as an intermediate station. Pleiotrophic tubular-vesicular carriers containing TNF bud off the TGN for the post-Golgi trafficking of TNF and their characterization both in live cell imaging and in biochemical analysis of isolated vesicles constituted the main parts of this work. Functional studies, including endosome inactivation and overexpression of Rab11 mutants (proteins functioning at the level of the recycling endosome) revealed that recycling endosomes have indeed an essential role in the exocytic trafficking of TNF in macrophages. This thesis also provides further insight into recycling endosomes as a possible intermediate step in the exocytic trafficking of several other proteins including the adhesion protein E-Cadherin, that function at the cell surface. Finally, the last chapter of this thesis examines endocytic pathways in activated macrophages. Assays for fluid phase endocytosis and receptor-mediated endocytosis were established and the regulation of both pathways was compared. The results show that LPS has opposite effects on fluid phase and receptor mediated endocytosis, decreasing and increasing their activity respectively. Recycling of transferrin through the recycling endosome was also measured, providing a link with studies on TNF exocytosis. Overall, the work in this thesis has made a major contribution to our understanding of TNF trafficking in macrophages, of macrophage pathways more generally and of trafficking at a fundamental level. The findings herein set the stage for more in depth analysis at a single molecular level to explore TNF regulation in normal and disease cells.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Macrophages, LPS, endocytosis, TNF&#945;, exocytosis, trafficking, live confocal imaging</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:174089</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Human Papillomavirus 16 E7 Inhibits the ability of IFN-&#947; in Enhancement of MHC Class I Antigen Presentation and CTL Lysis by Affecting IRF-1 Expression in Keratinocytes</field><field name="creator">Fang Zhou</field><field name="description">The results of experiments aimed at determining whether cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) can kill keratinocytes (KCs) expressing endogenously loaded antigen indicated that antigen specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes could recognize and kill keratinocytes expressing ovalbumin (OVA) or SIINFEKL peptide. Exposure of the KCs to interferon-gamma (IFN-&#947;) enhanced this CTL-mediated KC lysis and increased CTL epitope presentation on the surface of target cells. Expression of HPV 16 E7 protein in KCs affected CTL-mediated lysis. Expression of HPV 16 E7 inhibited IFN-&#947;-mediated up-regulation of SIINFEKL/H-2Kb complexes on keratinocytes, and also inhibited IFN-&#947;-mediated up-regulation of IRF-1 expression, and consequent up-regulation of TAP1 transcription. Further, overexpression of IRF-1 partially corrected the HPV 16 E7-mediated inhibition of enhanced susceptibility of KC lysis induced by IFN-&#947;. Thus, the effects of HPV 16 E7 on CTL-mediated lysis of IFN-&#947; exposed KCs are likely mediated by inhibition of MHC class I antigen presentation by IFN-&#947;.

Two common types of perceptual rivalry are (i) reversible figures &#8212; two-dimensional stable images that when viewed, are perceived to switch between different interpretations, and (ii) binocular rivalry &#8212; the alternations in image dominance resulting from the presentation of conflicting stimuli, one to each eye. Several investigators have suggested that these rivalling phenomena are mediated by similar neural mechanisms. Such a view, however, has not only been inadequately substantiated, but has also yet to be assessed in the context of a directly testable neurophysiological model. Miller and Pettigrew have proposed a novel, high-level interhemispheric switch (IHS) explanatory model of binocular rivalry. This model conceptualises the perceptual alternations as being mediated by alternations between one hemisphere&#8217;s selected image and the other hemisphere&#8217;s selected (rival) image. To assess their hypothesis, caloric vestibular stimulation (CVS) was used. CVS is a simple, inexpensive, and non-invasive brain stimulation technique that unilaterally activates high-level attentional areas. In accordance with the IHS model, CVS was found to significantly affect predominance (the duration that one image is perceived relative to the other, within a given viewing period) during conventional binocular rivalry with horizontal/vertical gratings and with orthogonal oblique gratings. The present thesis therefore aims, through the use of CVS, to extend this IHS model of binocular rivalry to reversible-figure alternations and propose a general IHS model of perceptual rivalry. Chapter 1 provides a detailed literature review of the field within the context of comparing both perceptual rivalries. In Chapter 2, investigations are presented on two different reversible figures &#8212; the perspective-reversing Necker cube and the figure&#8211;ground reversing Rubin&#8217;s vase&#8211;faces illusion. In these experiments, CVS was found to significantly change observers&#8217; predominance compared to their baseline predominance. These results demonstrate that interhemispheric switching also mediates the alternations of these visual phenomena, in addition to binocular rivalry, thereby extending the IHS model to one of perceptual rivalry in general. Moreover, the findings are interpreted in a cognitive neuroscience context, including a novel proposal of a forebrain framework for the IHS model. Chapter 3 presents CVS experiments that address the issue of percept&#8211;to&#8211;hemisphere selection and the reproducibility of CVS effects, following Miller&#8217;s initial work on two types of conventional binocular rivalry. In planned analyses, significant predominance changes were not found in horizontal/vertical rivalry, oblique rivalry and Necker-cube rivalry. In post-hoc analyses that accounted for study-design differences between Miller&#8217;s original experiments and the present experiment, CVS was again not shown to induce significant predominance changes in any of the rivalry types. Assessment of directional predominance changes following CVS appeared to suggest an arbitrary selection of percept&#8211;to&#8211;hemisphere in all rivalry types, although no firm conclusions could be drawn from the obtained data on this issue. Nevertheless, the experiments further extend upon Miller&#8217;s earlier work by examining the inter- and intra-individual reproducibility of CVS-induced effects on predominance. Such reproducibility was found to be low and potential reasons for this are discussed. The experiments in Chapter 4 examine a type of binocular rivalry in which dichoptic presentation of D&#237;az-Caneja stimuli yields rivalry among four different stable images: half-field rivalry between the images presented to the eyes, and coherence rivalry in which aspects of each eye&#8217;s presented image are perceptually regrouped into rivalling coherent images. Each of these rivalries was found to occur for about half the given viewing time. Furthermore, CVS significantly shifted the predominance of perceived coherent images (coherence rivalry) but not half-field images (eye rivalry). This finding suggests that coherence rivalry (like conventional rivalry according to previous experiments) is mediated by interhemispheric switching at a high level, while eye rivalry is mediated by intrahemispheric mechanisms, most likely at a low level. In addition, it is proposed that D&#237;az-Caneja stimuli induce &#8216;meta-rivalry&#8217; whereby these discrete high- and low-level competitive processes themselves rival for visual consciousness. The current thesis thus presents a novel meta-rivalry model of multistable binocular rivalry. It also presents the first direct evidence that interhemispheric switching mediates reversible-figure alternations, thereby supporting a generalised IHS model of perceptual rivalry. It is argued that both models provide a parsimonious exploratory framework within which specific predictions can be made and readily tested. Finally, the findings of all experiments in the current thesis are summarised.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">reversible figures</field><field name="subject">perceptual rivalry</field><field name="subject">bottom&#8211;up versus top&#8211;down processing</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">caloric vestibular stimulation</field><field name="subject">unilateral hemispheric activation</field><field name="subject">neural model</field><field name="subject">interhemispheric switching</field><field name="subject">percept-to-hemisphere attentional selection</field><field name="subject">meta-rivalry</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:174117</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural and functional studies of cyclotides</field><field name="creator">Conan Wang</field><field name="description">The broad aim of this thesis is to generate fundamental knowledge about the structure and function of cyclotides, which are a topologically unique family of proteins. A long-term goal is to use the fundamental knowledge to assist in the development of drugs based on the stable cyclotide framework. Cyclotides are small proteins that are characterised by a cyclic cystine knot (CCK) motif, which is defined as a circular backbone combined with a cystine knot core. So far cyclotides have been found in plants of the Violaceae (violet) and Rubiaceae (coffee) plant families, and are believed to have a defence-related function. From an application perspective, the CCK framework has potential as a drug scaffold, being an ultra-stable alternative to linear peptide models. The reasons why cyclotides show promise as a drug template are three-fold &#8211; they have naturally high sequence diversity, suggesting that their framework can accommodate a range of epitopes; they are remarkably stable under various chemical, enzymatic and thermal conditions, which means that they have increased bioavailability; and they have a diverse range of bioactivities, supporting the notion that they can be used in a number of therapeutic applications. These three reasons are intimately linked to three core knowledge domains of cyclotide research, namely cyclotide sequences, structures and interactions. Thus, fundamental research into these three domains, as investigated in this thesis, is important as it may assist in the development of drugs based on the CCK scaffold. Chapter 1 of this thesis provides the background information to define the molecules studied and to highlight their importance. Chapter 2 describes the main experimental techniques that were used in this thesis, including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The development of the CCK technology may benefit from a thorough understanding of the natural diversity of cyclotide sequences and the significance of this diversity on activity. Chapter 3 reports on the discovery of cyclotides in Viola yedoensis, a Chinese violet that is interesting because it is widely used in Traditional Chinese Medicine to treat a number of illnesses including swelling and hepatitis. In this study, a total of eight cyclotides was characterised, including five novel sequences. Based on anti-HIV and haemolytic assays, a strong relationship between surface hydrophobicity and activity was established. The stability of cyclotides, which underpins their potential as a drug scaffold, is examined at a structural level in Chapter 4. The solution structure of varv F, a cyclotide from the European field pansy, Viola arvensis, was solved and compared to the crystal structure of the same peptide, confirming the core structural features of cyclotides responsible for their stability, including the topology of the cystine knot, which has previously attracted some debate. From a comparison of biophysical measurements of a representative group of five cyclotides, a conserved network of hydrogen bonds, which also stabilises the cyclotide framework, was defined. A subset of hydrogen bonds involving the highly conserved Glu in loop 1 of cyclotides was examined in more detail by solving the structure of kalata B12, the only naturally occurring cyclotide with an Asp instead of a Glu in loop 1. By comparison with the prototypical cyclotide kalata B1 and an Ala mutant E7A-kalata B1, it was shown that the highly conserved Glu is important for both stability and activity. Chapter 5 reports on studies that add to our understanding of the mechanism of action of cyclotides, which is believed to involve membrane interactions. Spin-label experiments were performed for two cyclotides, kalata B2 and cycloviolacin O2, which are representative cyclotides from the two cyclotide sub-families, M&#246;bius and bracelet, respectively. This study showed that different cyclotides have different but very specific binding modes at the membrane surface. Currently, it is believed that for M&#246;bius cyclotides at least (e.g. kalata B1 and kalata B2), self-association may lead to the formation of membrane pores. Oligomerisation of cyclotides was also studied in this chapter using NMR relaxation. A computer program, NMRdyn, was developed to extract microdynamic and self-association parameters from NMR relaxation data. This program was used to analyse 13C relaxation data on kalata B1, providing clues about the tetramer structure of kalata B1. Although the three areas of cyclotide research examined in this thesis &#8211; sequence, structure and interactions &#8211; are reported in separate sections, the areas are not independent of each other. For example, the mechanism of action of cyclotides, which is reported in Chapter 3, requires an understanding of cyclotide structures, which is reported in Chapter 4. Chapter 6 describes a database, CyBase, which integrates sequence/structure/activity data on cyclotides so that relationships between the three areas can be examined. The database also provides tools to assist in discovery and engineering of cyclic proteins. In summary, several key areas that are fundamental to our understanding of cyclotides have been investigated in this thesis, ranging from cyclotide sequence diversity to their mechanism of action. The work described in this thesis represents a significant advance in our current understanding of cyclotides by providing, for example, explanations to their observed structural stability and how they work through interactions with other biomolecules. The information presented in this thesis is potentially useful in facilitating the long-term goal of developing peptide therapeutics based on the stable cyclotide framework.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cyclotides, circular proteins, sequences, structures, interactions, dynamics, database</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:174289</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beta-lactam antibiotic dosing in critical care units: bolus vs continuous dosing</field><field name="creator">Jason Roberts</field><field name="description">In critically ill patients, the pathophysiology of sepsis can affect the interactions between the antibiotic, the bacteria and the patient, leading to potential therapeutic failure and the development of antibiotic resistance. It is well acknowledged that research that optimises antibiotic exposure will assist improvement of outcomes in this patient group. Although beta-lactam antibiotics, such as piperacillin and meropenem, are commonly selected for empiric therapy of sepsis, dosing is unlikely to be optimal. In patients without renal dysfunction, data suggests that disease-induced alterations to pharmacokinetic parameters result in low trough concentrations for significant periods within a dosing interval. Administration of these time-dependent antibiotics by continuous infusion has been suggested to improve the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic profile. Knowledge of concentrations in the extracellular fluid of human tissue, which is the target site of most pathogens, is particularly instructive. Extracellular fluid concentrations can be determined using techniques such as microdialysis. Therefore, the principal aims of this Thesis were to determine the plasma and subcutaneous tissue pharmacokinetics of piperacillin and meropenem administered by bolus dosing and continuous infusion in critically ill patients with sepsis; and to use Monte Carlo simulations to compare the ability of different dosing strategies to achieve pharmacodynamic endpoints. This Thesis also sought to compare the clinical outcomes of bolus dosing and continuous infusion of a beta-lactam antibiotic, ceftriaxone, in a prospective randomised controlled trial and to perform a meta-analysis on clinical outcomes from other similar published studies. Finally, this Thesis aimed to systematically review the published literature to determine any correlation between antibiotic dosing and the development of antibiotic resistance. The results of the pharmacokinetic studies, using piperacillin and meropenem, indicate that beta-lactam distribution into subcutaneous tissue, in critically ill patients with sepsis, is less than that observed in previous studies in healthy volunteers yet superior to studies in patients with septic shock. This supports the notion that the peripheral concentration of drugs may be inversely related to the level of sickness severity. Administration by continuous infusion was found to maintain statistically significantly higher trough beta-lactam concentrations in both plasma and subcutaneous tissue. Further analysis of the plasma data using population pharmacokinetic modeling and Monte Carlo simulations described significant pharmacodynamic advantages for administering meropenem or piperacillin by continuous infusion to organisms with high minimum inhibitory concentrations. Given the documented pharmacodynamic advantages for administering beta-lactams by continuous infusion, a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted using the beta-lactam antibiotic ceftriaxone. In 57 critically ill patients, we found equivalence between continuous infusion and bolus dosing in the intention-to-treat analysis. However, our a priori analysis criteria, requiring patients receive at least 4-days antibiotic treatment, found significant clinical and bacteriological advantages for administration by continuous infusion. To further investigate any clinical differences between bolus dosing and continuous infusion of beta-lactam antibiotics, we performed a meta-analysis of all published studies. Our analysis of the 13 published prospective randomized controlled trials (846 hospitalised patients) showed equivalence of continuous infusion and bolus dosing. Possible confounders observed within, and between the studies, make interpretation of these results challenging. However, two large retrospective cohorts not included in the meta-analysis, found definitive clinical and bacteriological advantages suggesting further research may be appropriate. The possible relationship between antibiotic dosing, or exposures, on the development of resistance was investigated using a structured review of the published literature. Our analysis of relevant papers found a wealth of data describing increasing levels of resistance with sub-optimal antibiotic dosing, particularly for fluoroquinolone antibiotics, but also for other classes including beta-lactams. These results demonstrate the importance of optimizing antibiotic dosing to decrease the development of antibiotic susceptibility from sub-optimal dosing, particularly for critically ill patients who are likely to have low drug concentrations. The results of this Thesis, suggest that a large, prospective, multi-centre randomised controlled trial in critically ill patients with sepsis, is required to definitively determine the clinical utility of administration of beta-lactam antibiotics by continuous infusion.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Beta-lactam antibiotics</field><field name="subject">Microdialysis</field><field name="subject">Piperacillin</field><field name="subject">Meropenem</field><field name="subject">critically-ill</field><field name="subject">pharmacokinetics</field><field name="subject">Pharmacodynamics</field><field name="subject">Monte Carlo Simulations</field><field name="subject">bolus dosing</field><field name="subject">intermittent infusion</field><field name="subject">continuous infusion</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:174430</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Engaging with Gender in Public Transport Planning</field><field name="creator">Evelyn H. Ybarzabal</field><field name="description">Abstract This thesis investigates the extent to which gender considerations are being incorporated into the planning and policy making of the public transport system in Queensland, Australia. Using public transport in South East Queensland (SEQ) as a case study, this thesis analyses why and how gender issues are still being overlooked and excluded from mainstream planning. It investigates the application of a gender analysis approach in theory and practice and provides recommendations for integrating a gender perspective in the development of public transport policy. The study is beneficial in terms of making contributions to promote better understanding of how feminist theory could enhance the development of public transport policy. Both qualitative and quantitative research methods were employed. Participants were selected from different demographic groups (politicians, bureaucrats, academics, women&#8217;s subgroups and individuals from the broader community) using theoretical/purposive sampling methods. The collection and analysis of data were guided by feminist sociological theory as a framework and gender analysis was utilised in reviewing transport research, policies, programs, plans and legislation. The thesis findings showed that there are gender differentiated behaviours between men and women in relation to their transport needs. In particular, the manner in which men and women behave is linked to an array of underlying factors such as gender relations, the social role of women and their personal circumstances, household structure, transport-disadvantage issues, and their broader socio-economic environment. The research noted that gaps exist in the current public transport delivery in SEQ. Three main categories of issues were identified namely key gender issues, gender-obscured issues and gender-neutral issues. The key gender issues included personal safety and security, time-space pressured travel, lack of adequate facilities, driver&#8217;s knowledge, skills and attitudes, mobility-constraint issues and features of public transport that have gender impacts. The gender-obscured issues included language difficulty, cost and infrequency of service. The gender-neutral issues included but not limited to public transport design, unequal distribution of transport services and impacts specific to areas outside the TransLink network. The research highlights how the issues interlock with the social, economic, cultural, structural and political factors of the environment in which women and men live. The thesis concludes that there is a lack of effective engagement with women, and that greater attention to gender consideration in developing public transport policies is required. While Queensland State Government has made a commitment to improving public transport provision for women, it appears that such rhetoric has not yet been translated into practice. The research also noted that the practicality and political implications of transport policy seem to obtain a higher priority in decision-making domains than gender considerations. Failure to examine both ends of the gender continuum in service delivery will make more difficult the development of public transport policy as a gender-sensitive social policy. Furthermore, public transport policy making should not be undertaken in isolation from other planning activities. Other considerations outside the traditional planning approach have to be examined, so planners will have a greater appreciation of, not only the needs of the conventional public transport users, but also of those not belonging to this category including different subgroups of women. Policy planning often overlooks the construction of women as an homogenous category, without considering that they are a heterogeneous group with tremendous differences in age, ethnicity, religion and class, thus requiring different considerations for policy intervention. Policy planning has been constructed as an exercise with a focus on a narrowly defined scope and immediate concerns, paying little attention to long-term impacts on a broader and holistic level. The consideration of gender in transport planning is a case in point &#8211; gender considerations are important in transport planning not only because there are significant differential impacts between men and women, but also because in the long run, these impacts in turn will have great economic and social implications. Economically, the lack of consideration of gender issues in public transport often results in increased travel time for women, leading to loss in productivity for the economy. Socially, difficulties and inaccessibility of public transport for women, particularly in relation to performing and balancing their care and work duties could also lead to increased stress and tensions, affecting family relations and wellbeing, would also incur considerable social costs. Policy planning tends to assume the position of policy makers and rarely considers the policy impacts from a user or benefactor perspective. In the case of public transport planning, how best an experiential perspective rigorously incorporate the users and gender point of view, will require not only consultation but also political will and commitment. A true incorporation of gender consideration into public transport planning will also require the support of other social policies including welfare policies. Hence, the thesis argues that new ways of researching, designing and planning for public transport as a gendered set of practices are required.

During tumorigenesis, normal cells transform into tumour cells following changes in the expression of oncogenes and/or tumour suppressor genes, which are involved in many processes including the cell cycle, differentiation and apoptosis. An imbalance in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation in colon epithelial cells is usually associated with the development of colon cancers. Uncontrolled proliferation with a lack of differentiation is one of the major characteristic features of cancer cells and a remodelling of the Ca2+ signalling is linked to these pathways. Among the Ca2+ transporting proteins, P-type Ca2+-ATPases, the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA) pump, has a high-affinity for Ca2+ and is involved in the efflux of Ca2+ against the electrochemical gradient from the cytosol across the extracellular space. Four PMCA isoforms have been identified. PMCA1 and 4 are expressed in most tissues. Changes in the expression of PMCA have been documented in breast cancer cells, whereas the expression profile of PMCA isoforms in colon cancer cells remains unknown. Up-regulation of another P-type Ca2+-ATPase, expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum, SERCA3, occurs during the differentiation of colon cancer cell lines and is down-regulated in colon cancers. Changes in PMCA expression have not been assessed during colon cancer cell differentiation. The first part of this thesis describes the analysis of the expression profile of PMCA during colon cancer cell differentiation. Both PMCA mRNA and protein levels were assessed in differentiated HT-29 cells by real time RT-PCR and western blotting analysis, respectively. The results showed changes in PMCA4 expression, whereas changes in the expression of PMCA1 were not associated with differentiation of HT-29 cells. PMCA mRNA levels were also reduced in some colon cancers suggesting a remodelling of PMCA-mediated Ca2+ efflux during colon carcinogenesis. The second part of this thesis involved exploring the functional role of PMCA4 in Ca2+-mediated signalling pathways such as differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. PMCA4 expression was altered in HT-29 colon cancer cells via transient and stable over-expression of a PMCA4 expressing plasmid or siRNA-mediated silencing of PMCA4. An increase in the PMCA4 level did not alter or induce differentiation of HT-29 cells. Hence, up-regulation of PMCA4 expression may be a consequence rather than a cause of HT-29 colon cancer cell differentiation. PMCA4-mediated reduction in proliferation was observed in HT-29 colon cancer cells where PMCA4 was stably over-expressed. Stable PMCA4 over-expression was also associated with the down-regulation of the transcription of the early response gene, FOS. Despite the apparent augmentation of cytosolic Ca2+ responses to G-protein coupled receptor Ca2+ mobilizing agents, the sensitivity of cells to the apoptotic inducing agents such as TRAIL and/or CCCP was not affected following siRNA-mediated PMCA4 inhibition in HT-29 cells. Collectively this thesis describes PMCA isoform-specific changes during differentiation of HT-29 colon cancer cells and alterations in PMCA levels in some colon cancers.Evidence is also presented to suggest that alterations in PMCA expression in colon cancer cells may provide a growth advantage by promoting proliferation without increasing sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PMCA, calcium, HT-29, colon cancer, calcium homeostasis, siRNA, differentiation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:174452</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#65279;BETWEEN TWO WORLDS: CLAUDIO POMPILI, ITALIAN-AUSTRALIAN COMPOSER</field><field name="creator">Claudio Pompili</field><field name="description">Between Two Worlds, with its implied dualities, alludes both to my Italian and Australian backgrounds and to my popular and art music experiences. The dissertation comprises of analyses of and critical commentary on a selection of compositions from instrumental through electroacoustic to musico-dramatic works. Further, Part I presents a pr&#233;cis of relevant background in order to locate the compositions within both Australian contemporary classical music and international settings, and Part I includes sections on analytical methodology and compositional technique. Compositions examined in Part II illustrate the salient features of compositional technique, specific influences and aesthetic concerns. Both instrumental works, Fra l&#8217;urlo e il tacere and Ridendo vado sul fiume, were written during the earlier period of the doctoral candidature. The discussion presents not only the seminal influences including the use of interval-class (ic) construction and music technologies but is also intended to guide the reader from solo and chamber instrumental writing through sound design and electronic soundscape composition towards the larger-scale, musico-dramatic works. Part III discusses the major contribution. It is concerned with three mixed-media musictheatre compositions that were created in the period 2000&#8211;08 and which explore crossdisciplinary relationships. Whilst maintaining a continuous development of style, the works are on a larger scale in all respects: involve national (The Last Child and Touch Wood) and international (Lontano Blu) production teams and a greater number of performers; are interdisciplinary, conceptually more complex and multilayered, and longer in duration; include extensive use of music technologies, multimedia and multichannel surround sound in performance; and use graphic/text/prose scores. By their very nature, these compositions involved significant collaborative endeavour not only with the key members of the creative teams, such as artistic directors, writers and set designers, but also the performers in general and musicians in particular. The collaborations included development of the conceptual structures of the works with the creative teams and &#8216;hands on&#8217; interaction with the musicians in shaping the sound in real time through group-devised processes where appropriate.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410000 The Arts</field><field name="subject">CLAUDIO POMPILI, ITALIAN-AUSTRALIAN COMPOSER</field><field name="subject">australian composition, contemporary classical music, music theatre, electroacoustic, electronic music, sound design, italo-australian</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:174467</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Advances in power system small signal stability analysis considering load modeling and emerging generation resource</field><field name="creator">Yateendra Mishra</field><field name="description">With the increasing complexity of the power system, electromechanical oscillations are becoming one of the major problem. Several blackouts have been reported in the past due to insufficient damping of the oscillatory modes. The starting point to avoid catastrophic behaviors would be to simulate actual power system and study the response of the system under various outages leading to blackouts. Recently, it has been identified that appropriate modeling of the load is necessary to match the actual system behavior with the computer simulated response. This research throws some insight into the detailed load modeling and its impact on the system small signal stability. In particular, Composite load model is proposed and its effect on the system small signal stability is investigated. Modeling all the loads in a large power system would be a cumbersome job and hence the method for identifying the most sensitive load location is also proposed in the thesis. The effect of load modeling on the eigenvalue movement is also investigated. The low damped electromechanical modes are always undesirable in the large inter-connected power systems as they might get excited under some event leading to growing oscillations. Proper damping of these modes is essential for effective and reliable system operation. Power system stabilizers have been proved to be an effective way of damping these electromechanical modes. The optimal number and location of PSS to effectively damp the modes via improved Differential algorithm is proposed. Moreover, the effect of TCSC, series compensated FACTs device, on enhancing the system damping is investigated. A fixed order model matching technique is presented to design a damping controller for the TCSC. With the increasing global pressure for reducing carbon emissions, there is a great amount of interest in the renewable sources of energy, particularly Wind Energy Conversion Systems. Of all the present methods of wind generation systems, Doubly Fed Induction Generation (DFIG) based wind farms are gaining popularity. The comparison of various methods of wind generation techniques is presented. In particular, the impact of DFIG based wind farms on the system small signal stability is investigated in this work. Co-ordinated tuning of the controllers is performed using Bacterial Foraging Technique, which is another member of Evolutionary algorithms. Damping controller for the DFIG system is proposed to enhance the damping of the electromechanical modes. Results have proved the effectiveness of the control methodology. The contributions made in this thesis could be utilized to promote the further development of the damping controllers for large power systems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="subject">Power system stability, small signal stability, load modeling, FACTS devices, TCSC, PSS, Eigenvalues, Sensitivity analysis, damping controller, Wind Energy Conversion Systems, Wind farms, Wind turbines, Doubly Fed induction Generator (DFIG).</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:174625</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations into Multiple-Element Smart Antenna Systems for Wireless Communications</field><field name="creator">Konstanty Bialkowski</field><field name="description">In the past two decades, wireless communication systems have grown with an unprecedented speed from radio paging and cellular telephony to multimedia platforms offering voice and video streaming . One undesired outcome of this expansion is a heavy utilization of the available frequency spectrum. Particular pressure comes from new multimedia applications, which require larger operational bandwidth for their implementations. Conventional coding, modulation and multiplexing techniques are unable to overcome the problem associated with the limited frequency spectrum, and therefore modern wireless systems are improved through the utilization of the space/angle domain. In order to improve capacity and reliability with the space/angular domain, wireless systems require the use of multiple element antennas (MEA) accompanied by appropriate signal processing algorithms. Typically multiple antennas are used to steer the beams of the line of sight (LOS) signal toward desired users and nulls in the direction of undesired users. However, in the case of indoor environments, the presence of reflections, scattering and refraction caused by the environment, it is better to make use of non-line of sight (NLOS) signal propagation. As these types of MEA antenna systems are a relatively new concept in wireless communications, their potential needs be tested experimentally in real world conditions. To achieve this goal, prototype systems capable to implement various modulation, coding and transmission schemes for MEA are required. This thesis investigates the benefits of MEA systems by building and testing such systems in indoor environments. The project area spans across many disciplines including wireless communications, antennas, embedded systems and RF hardware design, and therefore the thesis begins with essential background information. This concerns some fundamental concepts of a wireless communication channel and its information capacity. These are accompanied by ample considerations of signal propagation and adverse effects of reflection, scattering and diffraction. Also included are the signal modulation and coding. Following this background information, the main topic concerning diversity and multiple-input multiple output system that involves the use of multiple element antennas is introduced. This background material sets the reasons for investigating of two types wireless communication systems that include multiple element antennas: antenna diversity and MIMO. Following the literature review, the thesis reports on investigations that realize the thesis aims. The first part of the undertaken investigations concerns an indoor 2&#215;2 MEA diversity system in which MEAs accompany conventional transceivers. In the experiments, Bluetooth transceivers aimed for a short range operation at 2.45 GHz are used, which are both connected to a 2-element antenna array. The connection is made via a switched beamforming network which involves 4-port hybrid circuits. Two ports of these hybrids are used for connecting antennas, while the one of the remaining two is connected to the Tx or Rx transceiver. By switching between these two input ports of the hybrid, two different radiation patterns can be formed, at both Tx and Rx. One Bluetooth transceiver is stationary while the other is made mobile by employing a purpose built mechanical sub-system covering the precise movement within a circle of 3 m. Both the movement and collection of the data as well as the display of the obtained results are accomplished with the in-house developed software run on a micro-controller and computer. Experimentally, it is shown that the proper Tx and Rx mode for a given position, improves the received signal strength. This leads to improved signal to noise ratio (SNR) and thus the quality of signal transmission. The implementation of this concept only requires a signal quality indicator, and simple feedback between the receiver and the transmitter. In the selected transceivers, "RSSI" was the quality indicator used, and is present in many modern wireless transceivers. Also, any signal quality indicator can be used. Although the experiments were performed with respect to the transmit/receive pattern diversity, they can also be easily extended to other forms of antenna diversity such as polarization or field diversity. The undertaken investigations are original in terms of the full proof of benefits of pattern diversity for indoor wireless systems. The second part of the undertaken investigations focuses on the design, development and testing of a full indoor multiple element antenna system. This demonstrator system includes two main modules: the baseband processor (based on a field programmable gate array) and the RF front end. The FPGA signal processing module is designed around the Altera Stratix II S260 chip, which is commercially available. Suitable hardware design is required to accomplish MIMO signal transmission. The RF front end module performing direct conversion between baseband and 2.45 GHz or 5 GHz radio frequency bands uses the commercially available MAX2829 chip. The interface between FPGA and RF front end is a set of analogue to digital (ADC) and digital to analogue (DAC) converters that operate on signals between the FPGA and the RF transmitter/receiver modules. They are capable of handling 12/14 bit signals at up to 125 MSmp/sec. The data rate chosen in these investigations is 3.125 Mbps. In addition to the MAX2829 IC chip, amplifiers, switches and antennas are included in the RF module. The development of this wireless communication system has been accomplished through a number of design, development and testing stages. Most of the research effort concerned FPGA based signal processing because this part of the system is where the information processing takes place. For the MIMO system, the transmitted signal has to be modulated and coded, with efficient utilization of the multiple element antennas in both these processes. The prerequisite to signal demodulation is signal synchronization. In turn, the decoding requires the knowledge of characteristics of the channels that are formed between transmitting and receiving antennas. For an efficient FPGA hardware design, all the numerical operations must occur in fixed point arithmetic. To accomplish all of these functions, suitable baseband signal processing algorithms were developed as part of the thesis work. First, they were written in MATLAB and then transferred to C++ which is closer to the FPGA implementation. Having confirmed their validity, they were hardware deployed. In the investigated MIMO demonstrator, QPSK modulation and the Alamouti coding scheme were selected for modulating and coding of the transmitted signal. The implementation of the hardware baseband module was validated using a purpose developed channel emulator. This emulator was capable of implementing the channel properties from actual measurements and from theoretical models. The applied theoretical models concern the single and double bounce scattering models, as well as a full EM model and include full EM interactions within array antennas formed by wire dipoles. These models produce random characteristics of the complex channel matrix which describes the channel properties for narrow or wideband case. With this channel emulator, investigations were performed with respect to channel estimation. The training and semi-blind channel estimation methods were tested using the developed emulator. To schedule signal transmission as well as to obtain suitable insight into individual processes, two extra modules were developed as part of the thesis project. These are the scheduler and visualisation modules. The scheduling hardware controls data packets for at the transmitter, and oversees the packets being decoded at the receiver module. For the visualization module, specialized hardware buffers and analysis modules are created for data storage. The signals resulting from the encoding and decoding processes are stored in these buffers, synchronized to each other, which allows for synchronous visualization of the signals. The data from these buffers is streamed to a PC via a 100 Mbit Ethernet connection and a soft-core processor (running uClinux) in the baseband board. Using a web browser on the PC, a graphical interface using scalable vector graphics (SVG) is used for interaction with the embedded web server to display and control what the hardware is sending and receiving. Due to latency, only a quasi-real time display on PC is possible, as 10 ms of time domain data takes 60 ms to display. The FPGA hardware performs real-time continuous data transmission and decoding, and the latency is only in the visualization system. Using the developed baseband system it was shown that the proposed semi-blind channel estimation was advantageous over the classical training approach when the channel properties change during packets transmissions. The developed channel emulator, semi-blind channel estimation algorithm and the visualisation software are the original contributions of this thesis. Having established the proper functioning of the FPGA baseband processor, the remaining investigations concerned the development of the RF transceiver module. This task was accomplished using guidelines offered by the MAX chip manufacturer. The challenge concerned its manufacturing in 4-layer board format. This part of the project required the outsourcing of the PCB manufacturing and component assembly to obtain successful production of the RF front-end board. The RF tests undertaken as part of the project verified the operation of this RF hardware. With the successful development of individual baseband and RF modules, the last part of project concerned the integration of them. Because most of the benefits of the 2&#215;2 MIMO system were demonstrated via the use of a channel emulator, this part of the thesis consisted of the results of a number of experiments. Considerable effort was spent for the full integration of the RF and baseband modules to make them ready for real-time operation. Some of the undertaken tasks were new, as they were not required for experiments using only the baseband system and channel emulator. One of the new challenges concerned proper symbol synchronization. Two novel algorithms were proposed and verified. One of these were based on a simple comparison between "I" and "Q" components of the received signal and the other one involving a correlation of the signal to a known training sequence. The last experiment involved the experimental measurements of signals transmitted over air using the testbed. As the number of interfaces was limited only one transmitting and one receiving antenna was connected to the 2&#215;2 baseband system. However, the Alamouti scheme is able to function when only one of the two antenna is connected, and therefore real-time performance in an indoor environment was successfully tested. The presented designs, algorithms and visualisation form a strong platform for other researchers to continue and expand the work done in this project.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wireless</field><field name="subject">Communications</field><field name="subject">testbed</field><field name="subject">diversity</field><field name="subject">Multiple-input-multiple-output (mimo)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:174760</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and evaluation of an educational intervention to enhance the ability of oncology nurses to provide supportive care for parents with advanced cancer</field><field name="creator">Dr Margaret Turner</field><field name="description">There is increasing recognition of the emotional dimensions of the cancer experience, and in Australia a number of resources have been developed to enhance health professionals&#8217; ability to provide psychosocial support for patients. Unfortunately patients with advanced cancer are not well-served in terms of resources, most of which focus on early disease and survival. Children of parents with advanced cancer face a considerable burden, but parents may avoid discussion with their children, partly because they wish to protect them from distress, partly because of lack of support and limited access to information to guide them in this challenging task. There are limited numbers of health professionals with the psychosocial knowledge and skills to assist parents, and they are largely confined to metropolitan centres, making timely and equitable access to appropriate information and support for parents a major problem. Improving access to information and support could be achieved through extension of existing educational and supportive roles of a variety of health professionals. However health professionals may avoid discussion about emotionally-challenging issues because of perceived lack of training, and low professional confidence. Avoidance is also known to be a common defence mechanism for health professionals who find that the burden of caring arouses painful and sad feelings. Professional education has traditionally not encouraged reflection on the emotional dimensions of work, or assisted in the development of coping strategies. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of an educational intervention to enhance the capacity of health professionals to provide timely, evidence-based information and support for parents with advanced cancer, to guide them in talking with their children. Selection of oncology nurses for this purpose was based on their accessibility across treatment settings, their existing skills in education and support, and the fact that patients find supportive care provided by nurses highly acceptable. The study employed mixed methods across several phases to achieve this aim. In the first instance, relevant literature was used as a framework for developing an educational intervention. Qualitative methods were used to refine the educational intervention: - focus groups with oncology nurses examined perceptions of their supportive care roles including barriers and educational needs, and critical feedback was sought from a group of nurse experts regarding the scope and style of the intervention. This data informed the development of the final intervention which comprised a self-directed educational manual and day-long interactive communication skills training workshop, supplemented with a brochure for parents with advanced cancer. The brochure was developed in response to nurses&#8217; expressed need for written resources to support them in their interactions with parents with advanced cancer. The brochure was based on relevant literature and refined using information gathered through in-depth interviews with parents with advanced cancer. A quasi-experimental design was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention using pre and post-measures. Thirty-five oncology nurses were recruited from three oncology centres in Brisbane, three withdrawing prior to completion of the educational intervention. Nurses&#8217; stress, burnout and psychological morbidity were assessed by structured measures; attitudes and confidence were assessed by study-developed questionnaires. Knowledge was assessed by examination of nurses&#8217; responses to two clinical vignettes describing a parent requesting help from the nurse about how to respond to their child. Changes in communication skills were evaluated by video-taped interviews with simulated cancer patients trained to deliver a number of scripted cues. Following participation in the educational intervention there were significant improvements in nurses&#8217; self-reported confidence in ability to provide information and support for parents with advanced cancer, and initiate discussion with parents about emotionally-challenging topics. After the intervention nurses were significantly more likely to take an active role in self-care strategies. There were significant improvements in generic communication techniques and communication skills specific to this study: emphasising to a parent the importance of open communication with their children; confidence in responding to an overtly distressed patient, and openly discussing poor prognosis. Analysis of responses to the vignettes revealed significant post-training reduction in focus on practical issues, reduced referral of the parent to other health professionals, and significant increases in empathic engagement and supportive advice likely to assist the parent to respond to their child. There were no changes in stress and burnout or psychological morbidity. The response rate for an acceptability survey was low, but respondents enthusiastically endorsed the educational intervention, describing changes in clinical practice: improved listening; increased engagement with patients about emotional concerns, and reduced avoidance of potentially-distressing discussion. Study participants were a self-selected group which may not be representative of all oncology nurses, meaning that the results of this study many not be generalisable. Hence the next step is a randomised controlled trial, in which the evaluation is expanded to include an examination of parental satisfaction with a brief supportive intervention delivered by a trained nurse, using structured measures of family adjustment.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">advanced cancer</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">parents</field><field name="subject">nurses</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177133</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PPAR isoforms and breast cancer and their regulation by ethanol and plasticizers</field><field name="creator">Nagaraj Gopisetty Venkata</field><field name="description">Abstract Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are transcription factors that belong to the family of nuclear hormone receptors and exist as three isoforms namely PPAR&#945;, PPAR&#946; and PPAR&#947;. PPARs function as key regulators of glucose and lipid metabolism and are potential targets for drugs used in the treatment of glucose and lipid metabolism dysregulation. PPARs also regulate the expression of genes involved in the process of cellular proliferation and differentiation. Since it was discovered that PPAR ligands cause liver tumourigenesis in rodents, PPARs and their modulators have been investigated widely in in vitro and in vivo studies of carcinogenesis of the liver, colon, prostate, lung and skin. PPAR&#945; and PPAR&#947; are the most studied PPAR isoforms in relation to cancer, while the association of PPAR&#946; with cancer is increasingly being investigated. Some studies suggest that PPAR&#946; and its ligands may have anticancer activity, while other studies identify a role for PPAR&#946; in tumour promotion and progression. Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in women with the majority caused by non-hereditary mechanisms. The activation of PPAR&#945; in breast cancer cells is associated with an increase in proliferation, while PPAR&#947; activation in breast cancer cells is related to differentiation and an inhibition of cell proliferation. The role of PPAR&#946; and its modulators in breast cancer is uncertain, as there have been limited studies addressing the effects of PPAR&#946; modulation in breast cancer cell lines. Environmental contaminants such as the phthalate plasticizers and alcohol are putative risk factors for breast cancer. The phthalates di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) and di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) are plasticizers that are used in a range of common household, medical and beauty products and as a consequence humans are exposed to significant levels of these compounds. DEHP and DBP are known teratogens in rodents and DEHP induces hepatocarcinogenesis in a process thought to be mediated via PPAR&#945;. DEHP and DBP are metabolized in vivo by esterases to the monoesters, mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) and mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP), and these compounds have been identified in human biological samples. MEHP and MBP modulate PPARs in various tissues and cell types, but their ability to modulate PPARs in human breast cancer cells is not known. Like phthalates, ethanol is another modulator of PPARs and alcohol consumption is associated positively with breast cancer development, but the molecular mechanisms involved are unknown and there are no studies that examine the effects of ethanol and its metabolite acetaldehyde on PPARs in breast cancer cell lines. This thesis describes studies establishing and validating a breast cancer cell line that conditionally expresses human PPAR&#946; under the control of a tetracycline regulator. Using this model, the ability of PPAR&#946; over-expression and/or activation by the PPAR&#946; specific ligand GW0742 to promote breast cancer cell proliferation was studied. Furthermore, putative PPAR&#946; regulated genes were examined for alterations in expression in the presence of the PPAR&#946; ligand. This work determined that over-expression of PPAR&#946; and/or its activation by GW0742 does not promote proliferation in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. This thesis also investigated the effects of the phthalate monoesters MEHP and MBP on PPARs in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. It was found that MEHP activated both PPAR&#945; and PPAR&#947; but was unable to activate PPAR&#946;, whereas MBP could not activate any of the PPAR isoforms. MBP was an antagonist for both PPAR&#947; and PPAR&#946;. Using breast cancer cell lines, studies were conducted addressing the effects of an increasing concentration of ethanol (0-300 mM) on the transcription and transactivation of PPAR&#945; and PPAR&#946; isoforms. Estrogen receptor positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells were more sensitive to the effects of ethanol than estrogen receptor negative MDA-MB-231 cells, with changes in PPAR&#945; mRNA more pronounced than PPAR&#946; mRNA. Studies in MCF-7 cells conditionally expressing either PPAR&#945; or PPAR&#946; in the presence of their respective specific ligands, GW7647 and GW0742, revealed that ethanol concentrations of 20 mM and 100 mM suppressed the maximal response to ligand-mediated activation for PPAR&#945;. Studies using the ethanol metabolism enzyme inhibitors 4-methylpyrazole and cyanamide, suggested that while ethanol was responsible for the modulation of PPAR&#946; transactivation, the primary metabolite acetaldehyde was responsible for the effects on PPAR&#945; transactivation. Lastly, it was determined that ethanol and/or GW0742 did not increase the proliferation of MCF-7 Tet-off cells. The findings in this thesis suggest that given the different consequences of MEHP, MBP and ethanol on PPARs, PPAR expression and activation by ligands may have tissue specific consequences and that PPAR&#946; may have a complex role in mammary gland tumourigenesis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PPAR, phthalates, MEHP, MBP, ethanol, acetaldehyde, 4-methyl pyrazole, cyanamide, MCF-7, breast, mammary, cancer.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177142</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community level serious leisure networks</field><field name="creator">Lawrence Bendle</field><field name="description">Abstract Drawing on the serious leisure perspective, social world theory, and social network analysis this thesis utilizes an exploratory methodology to develop a structural view of a social world network of 49 social actors comprised of the grassroots associations and the allied organisations expressly concerned with amateur artists in a regional Australian city. Semistructured interviews were conducted with spokespeople in leadership and management roles with the associations and organisations. The purpose of the interviews was to develop an understanding of the key attributes of the grassroots associations and the function of the allied commercial, cultural, and educational organisations, and to discover the patterns of links between these two types of social actors. In addition, the interviews explored the types of social world participation among the associational memberships; and the role, rewards, and costs experienced by the spokespeople who were fulfilling coordinating duties in the grassroots associations. The research found that associations of amateur artists were active in the local community coordinating their memberships, activities, and assets to provide calendars of events for the participants in a regional social world of the creative arts and that, the allied organisations provided complementary goods and services. Further, it emerged that links of varying intensity connecting the associations and organisations coalesced into a network. This comprised a cluster of social actors connected by their concern with actors, dancers, and musicians; a cluster of social actors connected by their concern with craft practitioners, community cultural development workers, visual artists, and writers; and of social actors with bilateral links connecting the two clusters. Also mixed serious leisure emerged as a significant mode of participation among the sample of grassroots association spokespeople who were interviewed and this was important to the sustainability of their associations over time. There are three major outcomes from the research. First, structural concepts from social network analysis in combination with social world theory developed into definition of a community level serious leisure network; second, this definition proved empirically viable in the research context, and third, a model to depict the phenomenon of a community level serious leisure network has emerged from the exploratory process. The findings have both theoretical and empirical implications. Theoretically, they assist research into the structure of community level leisure provision. The findings also encourage investigation of mixed serious leisure. Empirically, the application of network knowledge to improve community leisure resources can improve the outcomes for the social actors involved and the community in which they are embedded.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="subject">serious leisure, social network analysis, social worlds, creative arts, community</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177143</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geographical differences, national and international, in the utilization of the benzodiazepine and antidepressant groups of medicines</field><field name="creator">Alesha Smith</field><field name="description">Mental health disorders such as depression and insomnia are prevalent in the community; the use of antidepressants and benzodiazepines is therefore common. However if these medications are not prescribed and used appropriately issues relating to safety and/or efficacy can occur. There is also some concern about the misuse of benzodiazepines by the injecting drug user (IDU) community. The overall aim of this PhD was to perform international utilization comparison studies and analyze national prescribing data to understand and describe factors influencing the use of prescription medicines, in particular antidepressants and benzodiazepines, and to develop some ideas and initiatives to improve future use. Comparisons in the prescribing of benzodiazepines and antidepressants between Nova Scotia, Canada and Australia were undertaken. Dispensing data for all publicly subsidized benzodiazepines and related compounds and antidepressant classes of medications and utilization was compared from 2000-2003, using the World Health Organisation ATC/ DDD system. Australian dispensing data were also used to examine changes in the utilization of antidepressants and benzodiazepines between different age groups within Australia from 2003-2006. Dispensing data and numerical data derived from reports from Australia&#8217;s Illicit Drug Reporting System (IDRS) were used to estimate benzodiazepine use by those who inject heroin, in areas with high proportion of persons who inject heroin in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. To determine a strategy aimed at improving the use of benzodiazepines, the literature was searched and the latest interventions, solely focusing on increasing appropriate prescribing and reducing long term use of benzodiazepines worldwide were retrieved and analyzed. The comparison studies showed the use of benzodiazepines increased at a steady but comparable rate in both Australia and Nova Scotia, although overall use was much higher in Nova Scotia than Australia (123 and 48 DDD/1000 beneficiaries/day, respectively). However, the use of antidepressants in Nova Scotia increased at a higher rate than Australia. The variations between the two jurisdictions may be due to the more limited range of benzodiazepines available in Australia, or perhaps different initiatives to control. The differences may also be due to increased exposure to marketing, promotion, education or different prescribing practices in Nova Scotia compared to Australia. From 2003 to 2006, the use of antidepressants increased with age, with those over 65 years having the greatest use (86.9 and 97.7DDD/1000 population/day, respectively). Differences were also seen in the antidepressant most utilized, with the elderly using more tricyclic antidepressants than those who were younger. The utilization of benzodiazepines decreased from 2003-2006 in the same population (66.6 and 61 DDD/1000 concession beneficiaries/day, respectively). However, those over 85 had the highest use of benzodiazepines and used more long acting benzodiazepines than those aged 35-44. This demonstrates that the elderly still account for most use per capita of benzodiazepines. Some of this use may be inappropriate (e.g. use of long-acting benzodiazepines) and hence may provide a useful target for future educational intervention. The elderly also account for the largest per capita use of antidepressants. In areas with a high proportion of heroin IDU, the utilization of benzodiazepines by the estimated IDU population decreased (4064048DDDs in 2000 to 2613100 DDDs in 2006) however the overall use of benzodiazepines in Australia continued to increase from 2000-2006. This demonstrates that the increase in benzodiazepine utilization during this period was not primarily driven by use among IDU. The review identified three main target audiences at which interventions for improving the use of benzodiazepines were aimed at. These were consumers, General Practitioners or long term care facilities. Education, audit and feedback and alerts were the 3 major intervention approaches taken in the studies. The review concluded that studies which used a multi-factorial approach had the largest and most sustained reductions in benzodiazepines use. It appears that support groups for patients, non-voluntary recruitment of GPs, and oral delivery of alerts or feedback may all improve the outcomes of interventions. Using the review findings, an intervention targeting consumers and health professionals was conducted in a rural and urban area of Australia, using informative emails, bookmarks and website over a 6 month period. The intervention showed a significant decrease in the long term use of benzodiazepines within nursing homes located in the intervention geographical areas compared to the control areas. In conclusion the utilization studies revealed the current trends in utilization of antidepressants and benzodiazepines for Australia and led to the development of an intervention, based on factors that were found to influence prescribing of benzodiazepines. The intervention aimed at various target audiences did produce a small improvement in the prescribing of benzodiazepines.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Prescribing</field><field name="subject">Benzodiazepines</field><field name="subject">Antidepressants</field><field name="subject">Utilization</field><field name="subject">quality use of medicines</field><field name="subject">Intervention</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177147</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diversity And Plasticity Of Interneurons In The Basolateral Amygdala Complex</field><field name="creator">Jai Polepalli</field><field name="description">GABAergic interneurons in the basolateral complex (BLC) of the amygdala are a part of the emotional-learning circuitry of the brain and receive excitatory inputs from all sensory modalities via cortex and thalamus. Although the BLC, which is made up of the lateral amygdala (LA), basal amygdala (BA) and accessory basal nucleus, is under the influence of a strong inhibition brought about by local interneurons, little is known about the diversity, characteristics and functioning of these interneurons. In this study, I have characterised the BLC interneuron population using a transgenic mouse model in which enhanced green fluorescent protein has been tagged to the GAD67 promoter. This promoter is specifically expressed in all GABAergic interneurons, enabling us to visualise interneurons under UV light. Whole-cell recordings were made from GAD67 interneurons in the BLA to study their membrane and synaptic properties. On the basis of their firing properties, interneurons in the BLC were classified into six distinct groups. The calcium-binding proteins calbindin, calretinin and parvalbumin were found to be expressed differently in the LA and BA interneurons, with the majority of the interneurons in the LA expressing calretinin, whereas those in the BA mostly expressed parvalbumin. We also found diversity in the expression of postsynaptic glutamate receptors in the BLC. Long-term potentiation induced at the interneurons was specific to the cortical inputs in the LA. LTP was expressed only in interneurons that either lacked NMDA receptors or had NMDA receptors with fast decay kinetics. This form of LTP was mediated by calcium-permeable AMPA receptors and required a postsynaptic calcium rise for its induction This study shows that the interneurons in the BLC are a heterogenous population with respect to the expression of calcium-binding proteins, axonal morphology, synaptic and membrane properties. This heterogeneity in interneuron population may be essential for the specialised roles various types of interneurons play in the functioning of the amygdala and in emotional learning.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">amygdala</field><field name="subject">interneurons</field><field name="subject">Long term potentiation</field><field name="subject">Inhibition</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177154</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Literature&#8217;s Ghosts: Realism and Innovation in the Novels of Christine Brooke-Rose and A. S. Byatt</field><field name="creator">Andrew Williamson</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the novels of Christine Brooke-Rose and A. S. Byatt in order to question the extent to which contemporary British novelists are free to innovate with the forms of literary realism, forms that have a long and valued tradition in British literary production. Both authors, I argue, have reassessed the limits of the realist novel over the course of their careers, and the specific ways in which they engage with, or depart from, their literary inheritance are discussed. The introduction contextualises the literary climate out of which the two writers emerge. In the 1960s and 1970s, it was a commonplace of literary criticism to declare the &#8220;death of the English novel.&#8221; In the years following modernist experimentation, British novelists made a conscious return to the mimetic realism of the nineteenth century. Rather than the intellectual sterility that is often assumed to have dominated this period, I observe that there were in fact many writers who were continuing the innovations of the preceding generations, Christine Brooke-Rose and A. S. Byatt amongst them. To view realism to be in need of renewal is first of all to view literary production in terms of an ontological-historical distinction of texts as types of objects. It may be also to neglect the ways in which literary history is always already in dialogue with the present. Both authors have made concerted efforts to refresh literary realism; however, they have proceeded in very different ways. Brooke-Rose has experimented with the content and the form of the novel in order to renew conventions she insists are fatigued or overworked. The novels she has published since 1964 depart radically from what would ordinarily be recognised as realist fictions as they make no attempt to disguise their own textuality. Byatt, on the other hand, has reassessed realism through the forms of realism itself. Through an engagement with literary history, she revisits realism to pursue what has always been of value within it. In so doing, she creates a developmental model of literary production in which literary debts are made visible in the work of the contemporary writer. Chapter One examines Thru, the literary experiment for which Brooke-Rose is most celebrated. My starting point is her claim, following Roland Barthes&#8217;s S/Z, that she is the author of writerly as opposed to readerly texts. I argue that to establish any such easy opposition is to neglect Barthes&#8217;s departure from the polemicism that had marked his earlier work. Rather than interrogating how well her texts are supported by her claim to be writerly, I turn the opposition around in order to examine precisely how Barthes&#8217;s readerly operates within Thru. Through a close reading both of the novel and of Barthes, I illustrate that many characteristics of literary realism that Brooke-Rose argues are exhausted, in particular characterisation and narration, are still operating in Thru. Chapter Two develops Brooke-Rose&#8217;s opposition of readerly and writerly in order to examine its consequence for her own experimental writing. Here I return to Thru to demonstrate the ways in which Barthes&#8217;s readerly and writerly operate as interdependent processes rather than as opposing terms. I then reconsider her earliest work, a period she has since disavowed. I argue that rather than a separation, there is a continuum between her earliest works and her later, more experimental, writing that has not been recognised by the author or her critics. In Chapter Three I turn my attention to Byatt&#8217;s insistence on a developmental model of literary production. Here I identify the role that evolutionary narratives play in her texts. Two of her works, Possession and &#8220;Morpho Eugenia&#8221; are set largely in 1859, a year in which a specific epistemological emergence was to reconsider genealogical relations. In this chapter I examine the writings she invents for her characters and argue that she takes metaphors from natural history in order, not only to show the close relationship between literature and natural history, but to provide her reader with a framework of literary-generational descent. Chapter Four examines more closely the ways in which Byatt converses with her literary predecessors. She offers a version of realism that has always been concerned with perception, and with the impossibility of translating that perception into verisimilar fiction. In this chapter I identify the role that art works play within two of Byatt&#8217;s earlier novels, The Virgin in the Garden and Still Life, as she finds in them the same metaphorical ambiguities that bind the language of the novelist to imprecision. I then examine the ways in which metaphor works in these novels to elude precise signification of meaning. Chapter Five returns to Byatt&#8217;s neo-Victorian texts, Possession and Angels and Insects, and examines the author&#8217;s ventriloquism of her Victorian characters, which includes Alfred, Lord Tennyson and Arthur Hallam. Ventriloquism, I argue, is concerned with a remembrance of the literary dead within the present work and is thus an expression of mourning. However, to avoid melancholia the new text must also emphasise its difference from that which is being ventriloquised. I then discuss Byatt&#8217;s focus on nineteenth-century spiritualism, as it is through the trope of the s&#233;ance that she reconsiders the afterlife of literary history itself. The final chapter examines the role of the critic. The mourning of Byatt&#8217;s fictionalised Tennyson is singular and overpowering. Chapter Six begins with a consideration of two of Possession&#8217;s critics, Mortimer Cropper and Leonora Stern, whose readings, I argue, are similar to Tennyson&#8217;s mourning in their inhospitality to other readings, other mournings of the literary text. I compare Cropper and Stern to Possession&#8217;s other critics, Roland Michell and Maud Bailey, whom Byatt places in the role of literary heir. Not only do Roland and Maud display an essential respect for the texts that they study, but also their reading is open to revision. The literary text, as Barthes argues, must always keep in reserve some essential meaning. Only through interpretive revision, Byatt implies, is the promise of this hopeful-yet-impossible revelation made to the reader.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">a. s. byatt, british literature 1945-, christine brooke-rose, experimental novel, haunting, influence, literary history, neo-victorian novel, realism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177169</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expression of Long Noncoding RNAs During Mouse Development</field><field name="creator">Timothy Mercer</field><field name="description">Long ncRNAs (non-protein coding transcripts generally considered longer than 200 nucleotides to be distinguished from classes of small RNAs) are abundantly transcribed from the mammalian genome. Despite their abundance, little is known about these transcripts. Although several individual long ncRNAs have been well-characterised and ascribed important cellular functions, there remains considerable controversy as to whether long ncRNAs are, in the main, functional. Indeed, their abundance has prompted many people to argue that long ncRNAs are simply transcriptional &#8216;noise&#8217; generated by spurious transcription initiation events resulting from low RNA polymerase II fidelity. This thesis demonstrates that large numbers of long ncRNAs are specifically expressed along both temporal and spatial axes of mouse development in a manner consistent with a biological function. Custom-designed microarrays were employed to analyse the expression profiles of large numbers of long ncRNAs, along with protein-coding genes, in two models of cellular differentiation; the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells from pluripotency to differentiation along a hemopoietic lineage; and the commitment and differentiation of neural stem cells to oligodendrocytes. The core networks that include gene expression, transcription factor binding sites and chromatin domains that regulate ES cell pluripotency and lineage specification have been the subject of considerable attention and provide a detailed context in which to analyse ncRNA expression. Of those ncRNAs examined, 945 (26% of total) ncRNAs were expressed during the differentiation of ES to embryoid body (EB), of which 174 were significantly differentially expressed. Many of these ncRNAs were transcribed from genomic locations that overlapped modified chromatin domains, and in two further studied cases directly engaged with epigenetic machinery. Similarly, 332 long ncRNAs (9% of those examined) were expressed during processes of neuronal-glial fate switching, neurogenesis and oligodendrocyte progressive differentiation and termination, of which around half were also significantly differentially expressed. Furthermore, many of these ncRNAs exhibited expression profiles that coincided with pivotal events during the commitment and differentiation of neural stem cells (NSC) to mature myelinating oligodendrocytes. Consideration of the genomic context revealed many long ncRNAs were expressed from diverse places including intergenic, intronic, and imprinted loci and may overlap with, or are transcribed antisense to, protein-coding genes with previously described roles in either ES or NSC pluripotency and differentiation. This association also extended to expression profiles, where a comparative analysis often showed complex relationships of expression between ncRNAs and associated protein coding genes, suggesting a potential role for ncRNAs in regulating the expression of associated gene loci. The complexity and specificity of the long ncRNAs expression was illustrated by analysis of the in situ hybridisation (ISH) data conducted in collaboration with the Allen Brain Atlas. Of 1328 long ncRNAs, 849 (64%) were expressed in the mouse brain, 623 (47%) of which exhibited specific expression profiles associated with distinct neuroanatomical regions, cell types, or subcellular compartments. Again, examination of their genomic context revealed long ncRNAs were often associated with protein-coding genes of neurological importance and this association often extended to include linked expression profiles in the mouse brain. The comparative analysis of protein-coding gene expression relative to associated noncoding transcription also revealed an additional level of complexity in gene structure and genomic architecture. Analysis of both microarray and ISH data show 3&#8217;UTRs can exhibit discordant expression profiles relative to their associated protein coding genes, often in a tissue- and developmentally-specific manner. Indeed, a genome-wide analysis showed that the independent expression of 3&#8217;UTR transcripts is prevalent throughout the mouse genome where they may function intrinsically as long ncRNAs during development. Together, these genome-wide analyses indicate a large proportion of long ncRNAs exhibit specific expression profiles that are inconsistent with the notion they are meaningless transcriptional noise. Taken together with numerous studies published in recent years, this thesis provides evidence to support the emergence of long ncRNAs as a major functional component of the regulatory network that underpins differentiation and development in mammals and other complex organisms.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Noncoding Rna</field><field name="subject">Mouse development</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177175</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification and Functional Testing of Peptide Targeting Sequences for Vacuolar Compartmentation in Sugarcane</field><field name="creator">Mark Jackson</field><field name="description">Sugarcane holds great potential as a biofactory for the tailored production of novel products of commercial value. In many cases however, the accumulation of an alien product within the cytoplasm interferes with essential cell metabolism. To avoid potential interference, targeting the accumulation of biofactory products into vacuoles may be beneficial. Vacuoles represent one endpoint of the plant endomembrane system where proteins destined for inclusion must contain appropriate targeting peptide signals. However, targeting peptide signals used previously to direct heterologous proteins to the vacuole have not yet been shown to function efficiently in sugarcane. The emphasis of the work described in this thesis was first to characterise the diversity of vacuole types in selected sugarcane tissues, and second to identify and test the function of putative vacuolar targeting signals identified in vacuolar proteins of sugarcane. In order to investigate vacuole diversity in sugarcane cells, a series of membrane-permeable fluorescent probes were used to assess both the acidity and proteolytic properties of vacuolar compartments. It is clear that even from early in development, large vacuoles filled most of the volume of storage parenchyma cells within the developing sugarcane stem. These vacuoles were intensely acidic and contained active aminopeptidases. In leaf cells, vacuoles labelled by chromogenic indicators and enzyme substrates appear much more diverse in pH and proteolytic intensity owing to the multiple functions that leaf cells participate in. As the predominant sugarcane vacuole in vegetative tissues appears to be proteolytic, sugarcane sequences showing homology to proteases and protease inhibitors in other plant species were aligned and compared to identify potential vacuolar targeting signals. This analysis revealed the presence of several candidate vacuolar targeting motifs which displayed high conservation across plant homologues. One such motif, represented by the sequence IRLPS, was identified in the N-terminal region of a legumain protein from sugarcane, which was homologous to known vacuolar processing enzymes in other species. To test the efficacy of the legumain targeting signal and to compare with other motifs, a series of GFP reporter constructs was synthesised and expressed in sugarcane. The sugarcane legumain vacuole targeting signal was particularly efficient at directing an otherwise secreted GFP fusion protein into a large acidic and proteolytic vacuole in sugarcane callus cells as well as in diverse plant species. In mature sugarcane transgenic plants, the stability of GFP fusion proteins in the vacuole appeared to be dependent on cell type, suggesting that the vacuolar environment can vary in its ability to degrade introduced proteins. The legumain vacuole targeting signal was further tested for its ability to direct an avidin protein and a fructosyltransferase enzyme into the lytic vacuole of transgenic sugarcane plants. Avidin, derived initially from chicken egg white, is a glycoprotein that displays a high affinity to the vitamin biotin. For this reason it has been investigated for use in sugarcane as a biocontrol agent against cane grub species. For the production of avidin in planta careful targeting to an appropriate subcellular location is required to avoid a detrimental depletion of available plant cell biotin reserves. When the legumain targeting signal was fused to avidin and expressed as a stably integrated transgene, the avidin protein was detected by immunoblotting but appeared to be proteolytically cleaved within the lytic vacuole in all sugarcane tissues analysed. These plants were phenotypically indistinguishable from controls, indicating that avidin did not appreciably deplete cellular biotin reserves while in transit through the endomembrane system. In contrast, when avidin was designed for either retention in the endoplasmic reticulum or for transit to a different type of vacuole using a heterologous targeting signal, stably transformed plants exhibited a biotin deficient phenotype. This suggests that the legumain vacuole targeting signal was efficient at directing heterologous proteins to a lytic type vacuole where they can be degraded and inactivated if susceptible to proteolysis. When the fructosyltransferase (ftf) gene from Streptococcus salivarius was stably transformed into sugarcane and directed into the lytic vacuole using the legumain vacuole targeting signal, no fructan product could be detected. The low pH and proteolytic environment of this vacuole together with low expression of this bacterial transgene most likely resulted in minimal Ftf activity. Taken together, evidence is presented that the legumain vacuolar targeting signal functions efficiently in directing transgene products such as GFP, avidin and a fructosyltransferase enzyme into a lytic type vacuole. This vacuole has been demonstrated to be both acidic and proteolytic and therefore strategies to improve the stability of heterologous proteins targeted to this vacuolar environment are required and may be specific to the product in question.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sugarcane</field><field name="subject">targeting</field><field name="subject">vacuole</field><field name="subject">subcellular</field><field name="subject">Saccharum</field><field name="subject">biofactory</field><field name="subject">gfp</field><field name="subject">avidin</field><field name="subject">fructan</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177272</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Autoregulation of Nodulation and Root Development in the Model Legume Lotus japonicus</field><field name="creator">Qunyi Jiang</field><field name="description">The har1-1 mutant of Lotus japonicus line Gifu is characterised by increased nodulation and significantly inhibited root growth in the presence of its microsymbiont Mesorhizoboium loti (for example strain NZP2235). A sexual cross between the mutant and another L. japonicus genotype Funakura (with wild-type root and nodule morphology) demonstrated Mendelian recessive segregation of both phenotypes (for root and nodule) in 242 F2 individuals. No separation of phenotypes was observed, suggesting a single mutation with pleiotropic effects. Reciprocal grafting showed that the har1-1 controlled phenotype is governed by the shoot. Using a skeletal genetic map of arbitrary molecular markers produced from a Gifu x Funakura cross, the har1-1 locus was positioned between two markers at about 7 and 13 cM distance. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and transgene sequences were detected by allele-specific PCR in DNA isolated from small (1 mg mass) individual seeds and half-cotyledon of the model legume Lotus japonicus, allowing fast determination of a seedling&#8217;s genomic status. This permitted a shortening of the breeding cycle for multi-trait seed lines. Fast neutron mutagenesis of Lotus japonicus wild-type genotype Gifu resulted in the first time isolation of a stable mutant (FNN5-2) unable to form nitrogen-fixing nodules in symbiosis with Mesorhizobium loti, though being infected by mycorrhizal fungi. The mutation behaves as a loss-of-function recessive, and has no other apparent phenotypic effects. Molecular characterization indicates a partial loss of the LjNFR1 LysM type receptor kinase gene. Additionally part of the LjNIN gene (encoding a putative transcription factor needed for nodulation) is also missing. Transcript levels for both genes are severely reduced. As LjNIN and LjNFR1 are in the same chromosomal region we tested whether this terminal portion is lacking. PCR analysis confirms that genes within the relevant interval (such as LjPAL1 (encoding phenylalanine ammonia lyase) and LjEIL2 (encoding an ethylene insensitive-like response regulator)) are present, suggesting that the mutational event induced by the fast neutrons was either a double hit coincidently involving two nodulation-related genes, a major genome rearrangement, or a major segmental inversion. To develop an integrated nodule developmental model based on gene interactions in autoregulation, nodulation and plant hormone response deficient lines, HE double mutants have been built using the har1-1 mutant (hypernodulation and aberrant root) and the ethylene insensitive transgenic line Etr1-1. The homozygous loss-of-function mutant har1-1 has increased nodulation and decreased root growth. Ethylene insensitivity mediated by the transgene 35S::AtETR1-1 restores the normal root growth. The HE double mutants were confirmed by triple response test and allele- or gene-specific PCR. The current results in this study indicate that a) HE double mutants shown the same nodulation pattern as har1-1 and normal root formation as Etr1-1, suggesting that nodule and root control diverge at some stage with root control being ethylene-mediated and the Har1 gene, the orthologue of GmNARK is involved in nodulation. b) Grafting demonstrated that the shoot is the source of ethylene suppression of the har1-1 induced inhibition of root growth. c) The mutated Etr1-1 gene was able to replace AVG in BAP root inhibition; d) IPT-dependent cytokinin overproduction led to aberrant root architecture in har1-1; e) Crosstalk between ethylene and cytokinin in HE double mutant by qRT-PCR.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">autoregulation of nodulation</field><field name="subject">root development</field><field name="subject">HE double mutants</field><field name="subject">hormone crosstalk</field><field name="subject">Lotus japonicus</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177297</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Making a Mark: negotiations in the commoditisation of authenticity and value at an Aboriginal art dealership</field><field name="creator">Barbara Ashford</field><field name="description">This thesis is an examination of processes of the dealership regarding Aboriginal art and artists. I take the approach that the art dealership is situated at a nexus of relationships that contest and negotiate culturally informed values and categories of fine art, Aboriginality and commodities. I argue that dealers in Aboriginal art mediate categories of value through their particular practices of representation of the art and through the social relationships they foster with artists and buyers. Therefore, through the relationships formed in the exchange process, dealers both make and mark culture. In this study I acknowledge the agency of Aboriginal artists but approach the process of negotiation of cultural categories from the perspective of the non-Indigenous audience for which the art is intended. The research is specifically concentrated on a particular dealership, Fire-Works gallery in Brisbane. I begin with the premise that buyers are drawn to Aboriginal art for more than aesthetic reasons and that objects and artists&#8217; cultural identities carry high value especially if judged authentically Aboriginal in the current art market. Both the art and the artists are made and marked as commodities in the art market; and while notions of authenticity are central to value, value is itself shifting and authenticity unstable. To establish the tensions and shifts in culture formation, I outline the historical biography of the acceptance of Aboriginal objects as fine art and the genesis of Fire-Works gallery within this socio-cultural and political milieu. In the latter chapters of the thesis I examine social relationships and situated practices chosen by the dealership to facilitate sales through the negotiation of valued cultural categories. The study provides an original examination of how shifting cultural categories are dynamically formed and reformed in the commoditisation of Aboriginal art by social agents.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts - General</field><field name="subject">value, commoditisation, art, exchange, authenticity</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177316</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling of Froth Transportation in Industrial Flotation Cells</field><field name="creator">Xiaofeng Zheng</field><field name="description">A simplified froth model is proposed, which describes the froth transportation characteristics in three different regions of a flotation froth. In the stagnant region, new froth arrives at the same rate as froth collapses and returns to the pulp, so there is no net exchange between this region and other regions. In the second region, the froth rises vertically from the pulp-froth interface until it reaches the concentrate launder weir level. Then, the froth moves horizontally towards the launders in the surface froth region. Based on the mass balance of air passing through the froth phase, a mathematical model of froth transportation is developed for a cylindrical flotation cell. The model describes froth transportation time from the point of entry at the pulp-froth interface to the concentrate launder as a function of the geometrical dimensions of the flotation cell, the concentrate launder and froth crowder designs, as well as cell operating conditions and froth properties. The model was validated in two industrial scale flotation cells, viz. an Outokumpu 3 m3 tank cell at the Western Metals Hellyer concentrator and an Outokumpu 50 m3 tank cell at the Anglo Platinum Bafokeng-Rasimone concentrator, under various cell operating conditions and concentrate launder/froth crowder configurations. The results show that the model in general fits the experimental data well. Model fitting can be improved by taking into account the actual air dispersion profile in the flotation cell. Although the current form of froth transportation model does not explicitly relate the surface froth velocity to the pulp level setting, it was found during the plant test work that froth height can affect froth transportation and that the effect is associated with ore type and froth viscosity. A preliminary investigation into froth rheology was carried out separately in the Oukokumput 3 m3 tank cell at the Xstrata Mt Isa copper concentrator. The results are included in this thesis for future reference. In addition to not accounting for the froth height effect (pulp level setting), the current froth transportation also has some limitations when used for prediction purposes. There are three parameters in the model related to the froth properties &#8211; the air hold-up in the froth (&#61541;f), the froth height above the concentrate launder (hf) and the froth instability factor (&#61540;). These parameters depend on the ore and the cell operating conditions as well as the cell design, and cannot be modelled at present. Nevertheless, they can be measured directly in an existing flotation cell, which allows the model to be used for process control. Experimental measurement procedures and measured results from the industrial flotation cells are given in this thesis. The effect of the cell operating conditions is discussed. Finally, this thesis proposes a number of potential model applications, including the modelling of froth recovery of attached particles, the modelling of water recovery and entrainment, criteria for concentrate launder and froth crowder design, and a model for flotation process control based on froth images.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">flotation</field><field name="subject">froth</field><field name="subject">particle</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="subject">transportation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177332</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of a reciprocal-like translocation involving 6q in a melanoma cell line</field><field name="creator">Ms Jackie Fung</field><field name="description">Deletion of the long arm of chromosome 6 is one of the most common genetic alterations in human malignant melanoma. Recently, a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 6q and 17p was detected in a melanoma cell line, UACC-930, using arm painting probes of 6p and 6q. Reciprocal translocation is seldom observed in solid tumors. Upon further characterization of the translocation marker using techniques such as Southern blotting, genomic library screening and DNA sequencing, a complex rearrangement including two inversions of 6q and a translocation between the inverted 6q and 17p, [der(6)inv(6)(q21q22)(q22q27)t(6;17)(q27;p13)], was detected. An NCBI blast search revealed 3 genes being interrupted by the breakpoints: prenyl diphosphate synthase subunit 2 (PDSS2) at 6q21, Parkin at 6q27 and p53 at 17p13. Down-regulation of PDSS2 was commonly observed in 59/87 (67.8%) primary melanomas, which was significantly higher than that in benign nevi (7/66, 10.6%, p&lt;0.001), indicating the tumor-suppressive potential of PDSS2 in melanoma development. To characterize the function of PDSS2 in tumorigenesis, PDSS2 was stably transfected into a highly tumorigenic melanoma cell line, UACC-903. The tumor-suppressive function of PDSS2 was demonstrated by both in vitro and in vivo assays. The results showed that PDSS2 could inhibit tumor cell growth, decrease the colony-forming ability in soft agar, and totally abrogate the tumorigenicity of UACC-903 in nude mice. PDSS2 is the first enzyme involved in the CoQ10 biosynthesis pathway. Other studies have demonstrated PDSS2 mutations can cause severe CoQ10 deficiency and markedly reduced ATP production because of respiratory chain dysfunction. Interestingly, proteomics analysis revealed 7 out of 11 identified proteins (HSPA8, GAPDHS, TPI1, HSPA5, PGK1, ENO1, and ATP5B) differentially expressed in PDSS2-overexpressing cells were related to energy metabolism. Further studies are required to determine how PDSS2 could alter the energy supply in tumor cells. Taken together, these results support the proposal that PDSS2 is a novel tumor suppressor gene which may play an important role in the development of malignant melanoma via altering tumor metabolism.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PDSS2</field><field name="subject">melanoma, tumor suppressor gene</field><field name="subject">6q21</field><field name="subject">translocation breakpoint</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177360</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Questions to Answers</field><field name="creator">Yaron Lifschitz</field><field name="description">The University of Queensland Abstract Questions to Answers by Yaron Lifschitz The thesis, Questions to Answers, comprises two parts: a book-length collection of poems by the same title and a critical essay entitled &#8220;Behind the Verse: the Critical Prose of Poets&#8221; which examines critical prose written by three contemporary poets &#8211; Louise Gl&#252;ck, Anne Carson and Derek Walcott.

There are several categories of poems that run through the work. These include poems of love and loss; short, lyrical odes to heroes of mine (mainly composers and poets); poems about reading the classics; poems about abstract philosophical musings; and poems about family &#8211; including my young son and my recently deceased sister. The placement of these poems aims to give a sense that these subjects are not distinct; reflecting my belief that one no more leaves the world of the heart to read the Odyssey than one forgoes one&#8217;s fascination with Kant to fall in love. The critical essay explores the relationship between the poetry and critical prose of three poets I admire &#8211; Derek Walcott, Louise Gl&#252;ck and Anne Carson. It proposes that the critical prose of poets is a neglected genre &#8211; full of delight and insight into the minds of the poets in question. The first chapter focuses on how a small observation in an essay by Walcott reveals a key feature of his poetics. The second explores the functioning of Gl&#252;ck&#8217;s stylistic reticence as she admires the sparse works of George Oppen. The third chapter looks at Carson&#8217;s radical troubling of the line between poetry and prose and seeks to explore it using digressive techniques borrowed from Carson herself. I begin the essay by exploring how the imperative to write a prose component to complement my poetry gave rise to this subject and finish the essay by analyzing what I learnt from its writing.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">19 Studies in Creative Arts and Writing</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177409</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using new computational tools to investigate the responses of cotton plants (Gossypium hirsutum L.) to defoliation</field><field name="creator">Thornby, David</field><field name="description">Plant responses to damage, including defoliation, are complex. Plants have been shown to have a marked ability to compensate for damage, including by producing new or larger fruiting structures and by regrowing vegetative components following damage. While compensation for the loss of reproductive components has been widely investigated, compensation for the loss of vegetative components has been much less thoroughly studied. Similarly, biomass has been used as the index for studies of compensation in plants, while spatial aspects of compensation have been ignored. The spatial aspects of compensation include the topological position of lost and compensating structures, which is an indicator of resource allocation strategies in the plant following damage. Due to the complexity of interactions between structural and non-structural aspects of plant growth, particularly in response to damage, a computational approach to the problem is likely to provide advantages over more traditional approaches. In computational plant science, a simulation step may be added to the established scientific paradigm of hypothesis-experiment, so that it becomes hypothesis-simulation-experiment. The simulation step formalises what is currently known and allows for the generation of potentially more relevant and more testable hypotheses than ad hoc methods. Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is an important crop in Australia, and a significant part of the agricultural economy. Cotton&#8217;s growth is constrained by a number of environmental factors, including the activities of pests. Cotton&#8217;s morphological responses to damage are particularly complex. Accordingly, cotton was chosen as a suitable model crop for investigating morphological responses to damage with computational tools. L-system models of cotton morphogenesis were produced by linking hypotheses about physiology, initially from the literature and later from data gathered during the research, with the structural outputs of physiology. The resulting simulations were used to generate morphological hypotheses that could be tested with real plant experiments. During the experiments, morphological data were gathered with a sonic digitiser, allowing comparison of the architectures of cotton plants at the level of each individual component. Because the measuring technique was non-destructive, plants could be measured many times, creating a set of data representing dynamic plant growth. Relationships from the data for several experiments on cotton's responses to defoliation of the main stem and branches of seedlings and older plants were used to adjust the initial model, rejecting some physiological hypotheses and confirming others. The result is a model that represents aspects of the interaction between cotton's carbon allocation, topology, and signalling behaviour following defoliation. Initial experiments found that apical development rates are not limited by photosynthate supply, at least at the levels of defoliation applied here. Unperturbed, obligate apical development was shown by subsequent versions of the model to be a significant contributor to cotton's ability to compensate for early season defoliation. Experiments on branch defoliation illustrate that while the vegetative branches respond in ways that are similar to those of the main stem, the sympodial branches behave in qualitatively different ways. Sympodial branch development was found to be significantly perturbed by the loss of the subtending main stem leaf, somewhat perturbed by the loss of significant leaf area within the branch, and very seriously perturbed by the removal of both the main stem leaf and branch leaves. The ability of a branch to produce mature bolls was likewise severely affected by defoliation, either of the branch leaves or of the subtending main stem leaf. However, no effect was noted where defoliation was applied to nearby branches or main stem leaves. This supports the theory that cotton branches are independent physiological units with regards to photosynthate. Branch independence interacts with cotton's propensity to produce many more fruiting structures than it can mature as a compensation mechanism for defoliation and subsequent fruit loss. This research demonstrates the utility of the hypothesis-simulation-experiment approach to biological investigation. This approach provides a way to use qualitative and quantitative physiological knowledge to produce readily tested morphological hypotheses for use in real plant experiments. The results of such experiments are demonstrated to be not only empirical evidence of a response, but evidence in support of or contradicting proposed physiological mechanisms for the response. Thus, the hypothesis-simulation-experiment approach as used in this thesis represents a method for generating and testing more meaningful hypotheses than are generally produced using ad hoc hypothesis generation techniques.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">270402 Plant Physiology</field><field name="subject">620107 Cotton</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177507</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pest rodent biology, ecology and management in lowland rice fields of Cambodia and the value of local knowledge for site-specific research</field><field name="creator">Angela Frost</field><field name="description">Rodents cause significant damage to lowland rice crops across Cambodia and farmers are increasingly turning to chemical rodenticides for pest rodent management. Concern about the potential damage of these chemicals to human and environmental health provides the impetus for a search for alternative rodent management strategies, with particular interest in ecologically-based rodent management (EBRM). EBRM has a strong emphasis on non-chemical methods including the Trap Barrier System (TBS) and uses knowledge of pest rodent ecology to design effective interventions that limit population growth. For Cambodia, almost nothing was known at the start of this study regarding the identity, distribution and ecology of the country&#8217;s rodent pests. This research was designed to document this knowledge in parallel with a rodent management trial carried out at Somrong Commune in Kampong Cham Province of Cambodia, with the practical aim of informing on the outcomes of the trial and assisting with future development of EBRM in Cambodia. The large physical scale of the study and the relatively short time frame available for research led me to develop an action research approach that combined traditional positivist biological research with a more constructivist approach and participatory methods to gain access to and utilize local knowledge about rats. This research documents Cambodian pest rodents in lowland rice field cropping systems, through a combination of nation-wide collecting followed by detailed taxonomic assessments, and the use of farmer meetings and interviews to estimate the history and severity of the problem in each area. A total of nine rodent pest species were identified but both the pest rodent community and the severity of the associated problems vary from province to province. One species, the rice field rat (Rattus argentiventer), appears to be actively spreading and is not yet found in the northwestern provinces. A more detailed study in Somrong Commune found seven species and documented aspects of habitat use, breeding biology and movement. The inclusion of local knowledge in the study added a spatial and temporal scale to the study that could not have been obtained through conventional means, and which led to novel hypotheses about pest rodent ecology in the Somrong landscape, presented in the form of a heuristic landscape model. Criteria are developed for assessing the rigour and reliability or trustworthiness of the results. Particular attention is paid to the potential value of &#8216;expert&#8217; knowledge which is rarely used in participatory research but which holds enormous potential for research into technical issues. The results of the TBS trial carried out in Somrong Commune were analysed to assess whether implementation of this method resulted in lower levels of rodent damage and higher rice yields relative to a single control commune, Lvea, and whether the farming community in Somrong is likely to adopt the method in the future. Although some farmer survey data suggest that yields improved in Somrong during the TBS trial, statistical analysis of the quantitative data set fails to yield compelling evidence of any benefit from use of TBS. The results emphasize the important role of landscape factors, especially the annual flooding cycle of the Mekong River, in determining the spatial and temporal distribution of rodent damage. Analysis of the relationship between rat captures and claimed yield increases also suggests that the TBS was not primarily responsible for the yield increase&#8212;too few rats were captured to account for the additional yield, even under extreme scenarios for how individual rodents cause damage to rice crops. Somrong farmers are unlikely to continue with the TBS method after completion of the project due to many perceived technical problems with implementing the method, and other concerns over its high labour and monetary costs. The ecological results of this study are used to suggest various alternative means by which Somrong farmers might combat the problem of rodent pests. Finally, a new approach is recommended for gaining an appreciation of rodent ecology on a landscape scale. This approach uses a combination of generalities about rodent biology and ecology, field observations, and incorporates local knowledge from local &#8216;experts&#8217;. This approach is likely to yield a faster and more complete understanding of the spatial and temporal dimensions of a local rodent community than more conventional approaches and will hopefully lead to more effective and relevant rodent management recommendations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rodent ecology</field><field name="subject">Cambodia</field><field name="subject">rodent management</field><field name="subject">Rattus</field><field name="subject">Bandicota</field><field name="subject">local knowledge</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177553</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving the breastfeeding knowledge and skills of GP registrars</field><field name="creator">Wendy Brodribb</field><field name="description">Abstract Background The National Health and Medical Research Council and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners recommend exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of an infant&#8217;s life and continued breastfeeding with the addition of appropriate complementary food until at least 12 months. While most Australian women initiate breastfeeding, many wean earlier than recommended due to breastfeeding difficulties. As most women consult their GP frequently in the first six months postpartum, GPs are in an ideal position to provide encouragement, evidence-based information and advice that breastfeeding women need. In addition, women are more likely to initiate and continue to breastfeed if their doctor supports and encourages them to do so. The limited Australian data available question whether GPs have the skills to be able to effectively assist breastfeeding women, although no research has specifically addressed the breastfeeding knowledge or attitudes of Australian GPs. Additionally, there are no data detailing the breastfeeding training available to medical students, GP registrars or GPs. Aim This study aimed to identify the breastfeeding educational needs of Australian GP registrars and to develop a relevant and applicable breastfeeding educational resource within the context of these identified needs. Research design Triangulation methodology, using more than one data source and qualitative and quantitative data-collection methods, was chosen for this study to give a richer, more inclusive and wider reaching understanding of the issues involved than could be obtained by using one method alone. Therefore, to meet the aims of the study, a three phase mixed-method project with triangulation of data was designed. Phase 1 had three distinct data-collection arms: a quantitative survey of medical school curricula; focus groups with medical students from two Queensland medical schools; and interviews with eight GP registrars. Data from Phase 1 provided information about breastfeeding attitudes, knowledge needs and learning opportunities, and informed the development of a questionnaire sent to final-year GP registrars Australia-wide (Phase 2). The aim of this phase was to ascertain the GP registrars&#8217; breastfeeding attitudes and knowledge gaps. Phase 3 used the outcomes of Phases 1 and 2 to design an educational resource that would meet the needs of GP registrars. Results Breastfeeding was included in the curricula of most of the Australian medical schools surveyed (n = 10). Many medical schools relied on contact between the student and patients to provide clinical experience and practical knowledge. Medical students and GP registrars reported marked variability in breastfeeding learning opportunities. Although both groups had positive breastfeeding attitudes, participants had differing opinions regarding doctors&#8217; involvement in infant feeding decisions and the type of support and information offered to women. Overall, the breastfeeding attitudes of the 161 GP registrars who returned the questionnaire were positive (mean 3.99, 1 = least positive, 5 = most positive). However, while the mean breastfeeding knowledge score was 3.40, (1 = minimum score, 5 = maximum score) 40 percent of the knowledge items were incorrectly answered by more than half the cohort. Approximately 40 percent of the registrars were confident and thought they were effective assisting breastfeeding women. Nevertheless, only 23 percent thought they had had sufficient breastfeeding training. Registrars who thought their previous training was inadequate had lower knowledge scores, were less confident and perceived that they were less effective than the remainder of the cohort. A new finding from this study was that Australian-born registrars had more positive breastfeeding attitudes and higher knowledge scores than their overseas-born counterparts. In addition, while parents with more than 26 weeks&#8217; personal breastfeeding experience (self or partner) had more positive breastfeeding attitudes and higher breastfeeding knowledge, confidence and perceived effectiveness scores, parents with less experience had less positive attitudes and poorer knowledge than non-parent participants. Similar to previous studies, gender had no effect on breastfeeding knowledge or attitudes. Using adult learning principles, a five-session, case-based breastfeeding educational resource addressing the knowledge deficits identified in the previous phases of the study was developed. Evaluation activities before and after each session, as well as exercises designed for reflection and critical thinking, were an integral part of the resource. Conclusion This study found that the breastfeeding training of Australian medical students and GP registrars was inadequate and, regardless of their positive breastfeeding attitudes, resulted in registrars being ill-prepared to assist breastfeeding women. Based on the training needs identified in the study and in the literature, an educational resource was developed that presented information within real-life case-based scenarios. Additional background information provided logic and rationale for diagnosis, management and treatment. While the implementation of the resource is outside the scope of this thesis (but will be the focus of post-doctoral work), it is believed that the resource has the potential to provide GP registrars with training opportunities to improve their breastfeeding knowledge and skills, thus better meeting the needs of breastfeeding women.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">breastfeeding</field><field name="subject">breastfeeding attitudes</field><field name="subject">breastfeeding knowledge</field><field name="subject">GP registrars</field><field name="subject">general practice</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Questionnaire</field><field name="subject">family physician</field><field name="subject">general practitioner</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177560</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of proteolysis of the basement membrane during the development of equine laminitis</field><field name="creator">Michelle Visser</field><field name="description">It is well established that failure of the lamellar basement membrane (BM) occurs during the development of equine laminitis. This is due to loss of the crucial BM components; laminins and collagens along with loss of attachment complex, the hemidesmosome, of the basal cell to the underlying BM. Previous studies have suggested that Ln-332 may be the primary protein involved in lamellar failure. However, the details of the progression and mechanism involved in this pathology are not currently fully known. This thesis aimed to refine the proteolytic processes and mechanisms occurring during the development of oligofructose induced laminitis. Through the use of novel temporal lamellar biopsies obtained during the development of laminitis induction, it was determined that loss of both Ln-332 and collagen type IV occurs as early as 12 hours post induction. This loss of reactivity initially occurred in a focal pattern with increasing loss as the disease progressed in severity. At the later stages of laminitis, separation of the basal epithelial cell from the dermal tissue was also observed, however at these points the BM still appeared intact. This suggests that more than one mechanism may be involved in disease pathology; one resulting in fragmentation of the BM while a second results in loss of the cell attachment allowing the intact BM to slip away. Immunohistochemical analysis of lamellar tissue revealed a unique pattern of reactivity for the Ln-332 &#947;2 antibody D4B5, in which no reactivity was observed in normal lamellar tissue, yet the epitope recognized by this antibody becomes apparent during disease development. This initially led to the hypothesis that cleavage of the &#947;2 subunit and the release of biologically active fragments may occur. However, at the molecular level, no &#947;2 fragments were detected by western blotting. In vitro cleavage of partially purified equine Ln-332 revealed that both MMP-2 and MT1-MMP were able to process the molecule to produce fragments corresponding to the biologically active counterparts. This suggests that the change in reactivity with this antibody may be due to other mechanisms such as decreased interaction of Ln-332 with other BM components resulting in loss of structural stability of the BM allowing for a change in the orientation of Ln-332. Increased MMP-2, MMP-9 and MT1-MMP expression has been demonstrated in laminitis and this was assumed to be the causative agent resulting in tissue destruction and failure. However, work in this thesis found no increase in gene expression of MMP- 2 and MT1-MMP, as well as no activation of pro MT1-MMP. Increased pro MMP-9 gene and protein expression was observed early in the disease progression yet no MMP- 9 activation occurred. Additionally, activation of MMP-2 was found to occur late in laminitis progression at least 12 hours following BM degradation, thus MMP-2 activation is a secondary effect of laminitis development. Thus, other proteases are expected to result in BM processing. Gene expression of the metalloprotease ADAMTS-4, was observed to increase early during laminitis development, suggesting this is a putative factor involved in intensifying the degradation of the lamellar BM. Work in this thesis also revealed that both Ln-332 and collagen type IV are widely distributed throughout organs in the equine body and localized primarily to BM structures. A novel finding of this thesis is that not only does BM degradation occur in the lamellar BM, it also occurs in organs remote from the hoof. At both the onset of lameness and the acute phase of laminitis, fragmentation of both Ln-332 and collagen type IV also occurs in both the skin and stomach. Recent studies have indicated that both leukocyte emigration and increased cytokine expression occurs in the lamellar tissue during laminitis. Work in this thesis added to this knowledge as leukocyte infiltration into the lamellar tissue occurs early during oligofructose laminitis induction as does increased IL-6 gene expression. Overall, work conducted in this thesis has added to the knowledge of the events occurring during laminitis development. Even though the complete mechanism of tissue destruction and lamellar failure was not established, the progression of events is now more clear in that BM degradation is one of the first events to occur, while MMP-2 activation occurs secondarily. Thus, other mechanisms must be at work early during laminitis development and discovering what they are must remain a research priority for the realization of effective therapeutic strategies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Laminin</field><field name="subject">collagen</field><field name="subject">Basement Membrane</field><field name="subject">matrix metalloprotease</field><field name="subject">Hemidesmosome</field><field name="subject">Laminitis</field><field name="subject">Equine</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177564</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Imagining the Tree of Life: the language of trees in Renaissance literary and visual landscapes.</field><field name="creator">Victoria Bladen</field><field name="description">In Renaissance culture there was an iconographic and literary language of trees, related to the motif of the tree of life, an ancient symbol of immortality associated with paradise. The properties of trees were used to express a range of ideas, including the death and resurrection of Christ, the fall and regeneration of political regimes, and virtue and vice within the individual soul. The juxtaposition of the tree of knowledge with the tree of life, as motifs of sterility and fertility, expressed aspects of the human condition and constructions of spiritual history and destiny. This thesis explores the language of trees in visual art and a range of English Renaissance texts from the late-sixteenth to the mid-seventeenth century: two plays by Shakespeare, two country-house poems, and a prose treatise on growing fruit-trees. Each of the writers drew on arboreal metaphors and motifs in unique and innovative ways. However there are numerous parallels and connections between the texts, and with contemporary and antecedent visual art, to justify considering these works together. In Shakespeare&#8217;s tragedy Titus Andronicus (1594) Lavinia, when she has her hands cut off, is metaphorically described as a tree with lopped branches and linked with the stricken political entity of Rome. Shakespeare evokes the tree of virtue, the classical myth of Daphne, and the arboreal language of virtue and vice. In the late tragicomedy Cymbeline (1610), the king is symbolized in a dream vision as a tree, with its cut branches representing the princes who are initially stolen but then reunited with the king. The tree represents the family tree as well as the political state, two interlinked concepts in the play and in contemporary iconography and ideology. Since Cymbeline&#8217;s reign heralded the Nativity, the prophecy of the lopped and regenerated tree invokes the idea of Christ as the tree of life and the fruit of the tree of Jesse. In both plays, Shakespeare&#8217;s tree imagery comments on the exercise of political power and the resultant health of the state. Shakespeare&#8217;s contemporary Aemilia Lanyer wrote &#8220;The Description of Cooke-ham&#8221; (1611), part of a published volume of poetry entitled Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum. In the poem she imagines a prominent tree on the estate as the tree of life. An abstract metaphor is envisaged as part of the physical landscape. The motif transforms the estate to sacred terrain, enabling her to claim access to a space she is otherwise excluded from by class and gender. Lanyer links the sap from the tree of life with her writing, seeking to legitimize her claim as a female poet. Such strategies are part of her bid for patronage from the Countess of Cumberland, her primary dedicatee. In another country-house poem, Andrew Marvell&#8217;s &#8220;Upon Appleton House, to my Lord Fairfax&#8221; (1651), the poet creates a forest of the mind in which he explores different aspects of the language of trees. The speaker imagines himself encircled by vines and crucified by thorns, in imitation of Christ as the tree of life, while a fallen oak tree suggests the regicide. He takes on various roles including that of the enigmatic Green Man. I place Marvell&#8217;s imagery in the context of the Civil War and the relationship with his employer Lord Fairfax. Marvell&#8217;s exploration of arboreal motifs also subjects Christian tree of life imagery to the challenge of its pagan antecedents and reflects anxieties over the natural processes that threaten metaphors of regeneration. Lastly, in Ralph Austen&#8217;s A Treatise of Fruit-trees and Spiritual Use of an Orchard (1653), the author blends advice on horticultural practices in growing fruit-trees with religious metaphors. For Austen, gardening is both a physical and a metaphysical pursuit. His readers are expected to plant fruit-trees in orchards that evoke the idea of Christ as the tree of life and related ideas. His use of the motif is part of his advocacy of agricultural and social reform, motivations that were part of those in the circle surrounding Samuel Hartlib. Austen&#8217;s text is situated at the end of the English Renaissance and at the beginnings of the Scientific Revolution, when emblematic and symbolic frameworks for interpreting the natural world were subject to new pressures derived from empirical and rationalistic outlooks. What becomes apparent from these works is that tree metaphors were literalized, just as they had been in visual art, and given a new naturalism as they were projected onto landscapes. Symbolic trees merged with botanical trees in imagined landscapes, creating hybrid terrains that were both descriptive and mythical. Recognition of the language of trees in Renaissance culture opens up new readings of both canonical and lesser-known texts and highlights the porous disciplinary border between literature and art. Our historical readings are richer for understanding the potent language of trees. Overall the thesis highlights the importance and cultural preoccupation with trees in European visual and literary traditions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">renaissance literature, iconography, shakespeare, lanyer, marvell, austen, tree of life, dry tree, green man, tree of jesse</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177578</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biology, demography and conservation of rays in Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia.</field><field name="creator">Simon Pierce</field><field name="description">Thirteen elasmobranch species were collected during a four year seine-net survey of the intertidal margins of Moreton Bay, a large subtropical embayment in southeast Queensland, Australia. The inshore elasmobranch fauna of Moreton Bay is relatively species rich in comparison to sites elsewhere in Australia, emphasising the regional importance of this ecosystem. Stingrays were the most common large predators in the intertidal, with overall catches dominated numerically by the blue-spotted maskray Neotrygon kuhlii (53.8%) and the estuary stingray Dasyatis fluviorum (22.2%). The biological and demographic characteristics of these two species were examined in detail. Neotrygon kuhlii ranged in size from 11.5 &#8211; 46.5 cm disc width (WD), with 50% maturity in females at 31.4 cm WD and 6.32 years old and at 29.4 cm WD and 3.95 years in males. Neotrygon kuhlii has a synchronous annual reproductive cycle, producing one litter of 1 &#8211; 3 pups (mean of 1.67 &#177; 0.71 S.D.) in the late Austral summer after a four month gestation. Maximum age estimates of 13 and 10 years were obtained from females and male N. kuhlii, respectively. Annual band pair deposition was confirmed through the recapture of four wild calcein-injected individuals from 22.7 to 30.2 cm WD. A three parameter power function provided the best statistical fit to age-at-size data for both sexes, providing parameter estimates of y0 = 163.13, a = 58.52 and b = 0.58 for females and y0 = 165.13, a = 59.02 and b = 0.54 in males. Individual growth rates obtained from tagged specimens were not qualitatively different to modelled growth predictions. Tagging studies produced a total recapture rate of 16.1%, with individual rays at liberty for up to 1081 days. Direct estimates of instantaneous mortality for N. kuhlii were derived by creating catch curves for both sexes from age-frequency keys. Mortality was estimated at 0.171 &#177; 0.024.yr-1 S.E. in females, corresponding with a population growth rate of 1.00.yr-1 based on deterministic matrix demographic model predictions, and 0.345 &#177; 0.022.yr-1 S.E. in males. Seven age-independent and two age-dependent indirect mortality estimates produced negative population growth rates of 0.84 to 0.98.yr-1. Elasticity results were relatively robust to mortality estimates, with juvenile survivorship contributing 74-75% of total elasticity under all scenarios. Dasyatis fluviorum is endemic to near-shore, estuarine and riverine habitats along the eastern coast of Australia. Previous records of the species from northern Australia and New Guinea appear to be misidentifications of other, similar species. Dasyatis fluviorum was caught at 15.5 cm to 76.2 cm WD in Moreton Bay, with 50% maturity occurring at 63 cm WD (13.40 years) in females and 41.2 cm WD (6.97 years) in males. Maximum age estimates of 21 and 16 years were obtained from females and males, respectively. The Gompertz growth function provided the best fit to estimated age data in female D. fluviorum, providing parameter estimates of WD&#8734; = 100.3 cm, k = 0.09.yr-1 and t0 = 5.66. The modified two-parameter von Bertalanffy growth function provided the best fit to male size-at-age data, providing parameter estimates of WD&#8734; = 73.4 cm, k = 0.10.yr-1 and b = 0.86. An annual reproductive cycle in female D. fluviorum was hypothesised based on preliminary reproductive data. Fecundity estimates were derived from the related D. americana for input into deterministic and stochastic demographic models. Six out of nine indirect mortality estimates produced positive population growth in deterministic models, with a probabilistic estimate of 1.02.yr-1. Elasticity results were robust to model structure, mortality and fecundity estimates, with juvenile survivorship comprising 74-78% of total elasticity under all scenarios. Both N. kuhlii and D. fluviorum provide interesting case studies in elasmobranch conservation. Neotrygon kuhlii is a common bycatch of demersal prawn-trawl fisheries in Australia. Although mandatory turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) exclude most large vertebrates from trawl catches in Australian waters, their benefits in the reduction of smaller elasmobranch bycatch has not been empirically tested. The results of deterministic demographic models show that TEDs can, in principle, mitigate the impacts of trawl fisheries by partially excluding highly-elastic large juvenile age-classes. However, N. kuhlii is the largest of the four Neotrygon species found in Australian waters and bycatch of the three smaller species may be less reduced by current bycatch reduction technologies. Dasyatis fluviorum is affected by a suite of anthropogenic threats in its near-shore and estuarine habitats including commercial and recreational fisheries, habitat modification and pollution. Within Moreton Bay, 10.8% of the surveyed population bore evidence of past interactions with fisheries as evidenced by retained hooks or mutilated tails. Deep-hooking resulted in significant pathological effects including fibrocollagenous scar tissue masses, peritonitis and hepatitis. Stochastic demographic scenarios were created to model the potential effects of low (0.02 yr-1), medium (0.05 yr-1) and high (0.10 yr-1) rates of additive anthropogenic mortality to simulate stage-specific conservation interventions on D. fluviorum. Removing anthropogenic mortality on juvenile age-classes provided the largest benefits in terms of reducing population decline.

This thesis explores the evolution of the vision and values of the Congregation of the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart and its contribution to Catholic education in Queensland during the years 1870 to 1970. During this period the institute gained official recognition within the Catholic Church, established an innovative vision and method of Catholic education for the working class and clarified for its memebers the style of spirituality that was to underpin their lives. The main contention of the thesis is that this Australian institute of women religious can claim a place not only in religious history but also in the secular history of Australia. The influence of the Josephites can be found in community history, education history and the history of women, but as Keating stated: 'Their contribution has not always been acknowledged'. The Congregation of the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart,one of the first institutes of women religious founded in Australia, was invited to Queensland in 1869 by Bishop James Quinn, the first Catholic bishop of Brisbane. At the time of the foundation of the institute in 1866, there was growing support within Australia for liberal democracy and state-controlled, general secular education. The founders of the institute, Mary MacKillop and Julian Tenison Woods fashioned the Josephites to meet the Catholic educational needs of the working class in the rural townships and in the poorer sections of the cities. In the parish schools the Sisters of St Joseph offered the children an education that gave a priority to the practical, sought to situate the subject matter within an Australian context and integrated the religious and the secular. The egalitarianism that they fostered in the organisation of their schools had become by 1920, the model for the organisation of the Catholic parish schools in Queensland. When the government withdrew its support for some Catholic parish schools in the colony during the 1870s, the Sisters of St Joseph, supported by the generosity of the laity, proved that it was possible for these schools to continue. By 1970 the Josephites had opened 69 Catholic parish schools in the state. This thesis is the first to use the many archival documents in a research that covers the period 1870 to 1970 in the history of the Sisters of St Joseph in Queensland. Historians have attempted to throw light on the tangle of issues that influenced the dramatic event, the total withdrawal of the Sisters of St Joseph from Queensland after ten years of productive ministry during the period 1870-1880, but no study has been made into the subsequent history of the institute in Queensland. In the period under discussion women were beginning to claim a place of equality in society. Mary MacKillop, in her manner of claiming the rights of the Josephites, offered a role model to the women in the institute she founded. In turn the Sisters of St Joseph showed other women the effectiveness of collaborative effort. The history of the Congregation of the Sisters of St Joseph in Queensland shows the strengths and weaknesses of this community of women, described by MacKillop as 'courageous, cheerful, very hopeful and not easily disheartened', as they endeavoured to espouse her vision and values in their lifestyle and apostolate.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Religious Institutes, religious institutes, women</field><field name="subject">Catholic Church, education, Catholic Education</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177588</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constraining short B cell epitopes as alpha helices</field><field name="creator">Dhiraj Hans</field><field name="description">The host adaptive immune response to a pathogen infection comprises both cell mediated and antibody dependent components. Antibody mediated neutralization is a key component of protection against viruses and is the primary focus of this thesis. Antibodies recognize structurally defined epitopes within the context of native proteins. These may be represented by a simple linear sequence of amino acids or a discontinuous sequence of residues brought together by the conformational constraints of the protein. Many protein epitopes recognized by antibodies have been shown to be short &#945;-helices of 3-5 turns. However corresponding synthetic peptides of this length have no structure in water because solvent competes strongly for the hydrogen bonding amides otherwise required to hydrogen bond one another to define an &#945;-helix. This thesis is aimed primarily at (1) synthetically constraining short peptide sequences (9-13 residues) into stable &#945;-helices of 3-4 turns; (2) structurally characterizing such constrained &#945;-helical structures by circular dichroism and 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy; and (3) evaluating these helix mimetics for serum stability, immunogenicity, antigenicity as well as the biological relevance of the antibodies they induce. The overall aim was to demonstrate that constrained short peptides more effectively structurally and functionally mimic known &#945;-helical B cell epitopes from native proteins than unconstrained short peptides of the same lengths. The primary focus of Chapter 2 was to optimize in vitro ELISA conditions and immunization protocols for potentially assessing antibody responses in mice to short peptides corresponding to segments of important dengue virus proteins (NS1 and the envelope fusion protein, E). The NS1 peptide investigated had been suggested to be an &#945;-helical epitope, but my investigations reveal that it is more likely a turn rather than a helix. While the E protein epitope chosen was not a viable epitope for testing a helix-constraining strategy, it was evaluated as a constrained turn mimic of a viral fusion epitope. Although the constrained peptides from both proteins (NS1 and E) elicited stronger antibody responses in mice than their unconstrained analogues, they still induced relatively poor antibody levels. Interestingly, mouse antibodies raised to the constrained peptide (&#946;-turn analogue) from NS1 protein also reacted with the native protein. To evaluate a helix-constraining strategy for short peptides (less than 15 residues) that have no helix structure in water, an epitope of the HPV E7 protein was selected for mimicry. A short peptide sequence corresponding to this B cell epitope had previously been reported to have &#945;-helical propensity but only in trifluoroethanol-water mixtures, and my initial work showed that it had no detectable helical structure at all in water. Chapter 3 presents an example of a short helical peptide as a B cell epitope, constrained into an &#945;-helix by a side chain to side chain lactam bridge. The constraint involved cyclizing the peptide by specifically linking together side chains of lysine and aspartic acid inserted in the sequence three amino acids apart. CD and NMR structural studies highlighted significant &#945;-helicity in the constrained short peptide, whereas the corresponding unconstrained short peptide had no structure in water. Both unconstrained and constrained short peptide epitopes were injected into mice and antibodies raised were quantified ex vivo by peptide ELISA. The helix-constrained epitope elicited higher antibody titres than the unconstrained peptide which was relatively non-immunogenic. Importantly, antibodies raised to the constrained synthetic &#945;-helical peptide also reacted with the native E7 protein, suggesting that the helical constraint conferred on the peptide a structure analogous to that seen in the protein. In Chapter 4 a constrained &#945;-helical peptide corresponding to a crystallographically defined &#945;-helical sequence in the fusion, F protein of respiratory syncitial virus (RSV) was investigated for its potential to induce an antibody response. Again, while the helix-constrained peptide clearly had &#945;-helicity by CD and NMR studies, the unconstrained short peptide had no detectable helical structure in water. To potentially boost antibody responses, relative to those generated against the dengue virus peptides examined in Chapter 3, both unconstrained and constrained peptides were coupled to the carrier protein KLH before immunizing mice. Significant levels of peptide reactive antibody were generated to both the unconstrained and constrained peptides. However, when investigated in a viral neutralization assay, the antibodies raised to the unconstrained peptide showed a higher neutralization potential than those raised to the constrained peptide. We attribute this unexpected difference to the fact that the region of the F protein corresponding to the epitope chosen, undergoes dramatic conformational changes during the viral fusion process and it is only in its post-fusion form that this helix has been observed. It is possible that the inherent flexibility of the linear, unconstrained counterpart of this epitope may more effectively mimic the conformational intermediates of the native structure on presentation to the immune system. Chapter 5 began an examination of the effects of three different adjuvants on antibody induction by short peptides. They were compared using a candidate peptide vaccine for malaria as a model system. As before, a helix-constrained peptide was compared with its unconstrained peptide sequence in immunization experiments. Higher titres of antibodies were raised to the constrained versus unconstrained peptides. In the second part of this chapter, a putative cancer vaccine peptide was similarly constrained via an ester linkage or a helix-inducing lactam bridge but both methods induced only low T-cell responses compared to their corresponding unconstrained sequences, possibly because the incorrect structure had been stabilized. The focus of this thesis was to evaluate a helix stabilization strategy for its possible application to short peptide vaccines. Using extensive circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy measurements, we have shown in all cases that helix-constrained peptides were much more &#945;-helical in solution than their corresponding unconstrained short peptide sequences that tended to have no or negligible &#945;-helix structure in water. In some examples, we have compared serum stability and found that constrained peptides have higher serum stability than unconstrained peptides, a difference attributed to their greater stability towards proteolytic degradation &#8211; proteases being unable to recognize helices. We have also proven that the helix-constrained peptides induced higher mouse antibody titres than unconstrained peptides. Several attempts were made to boost antibody responses to the peptides by varying either immunization protocols, adjuvant or by attaching a carrier molecule. Further work is needed to optimize this promising new approach to short peptide vaccines.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">peptide</field><field name="subject">B cell epitope</field><field name="subject">vaccine</field><field name="subject">alpha helix</field><field name="subject">adjuvant</field><field name="subject">antigen</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177598</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Advances in Cross-Entropy Methods</field><field name="creator">Thomas Taimre</field><field name="description">The cross-entropy method is an established technique for solving difficult estimation, simulation, and optimisation problems. The method has its origins in an adaptive importance sampling procedure for rare-event estimation published by R. Y. Rubinstein in 1997. In that publication, the adaptive procedure produces a parametric probability density function whose parameters minimise the variance of the associated likelihood ratio estimator. This variance minimisation can also be viewed as minimising a measure of divergence to the minimum-variance importance sampling density over all members of the parametric family in question. Soon thereafter it was realised that the same adaptive importance sampling procedure could be used to solve combinatorial optimisation problems by viewing the set of solutions to the optimisation problem as a rare-event. This realisation led to the debut of the cross-entropy method in 1999, where it was introduced as a modification to the existing adaptive importance sampling procedure, with a different choice of directed divergence measure, in particular, the Kullback-Leibler cross-entropy. The contributions of this thesis are threefold. Firstly, in a review capacity, it provides an up-to-date consolidation of material on the cross-entropy method and its generalisations, as well as a collation of background material on importance sampling and Monte Carlo methods. The reviews are elucidated with original commentary and examples. Secondly, two new major applications of the cross-entropy methodology to optimisation problems are presented, advancing the boundary of knowledge on cross-entropy in the applied arena. Thirdly, two contributions to the methodological front are (a) an original extension of the generalised cross-entropy framework which enables one to construct state- and time-dependent importance sampling algorithms, and (b) a new algorithm for counting solutions to difficult binary-encoded problems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="subject">cross-entropy</field><field name="subject">importance sampling</field><field name="subject">rare events</field><field name="subject">optimisation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177603</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene expression in the alcoholic brain</field><field name="creator">Rosemarie Kryger</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT Alcoholism inflicts great suffering on individuals and their families and constitutes a huge financial and health burden for society. Current treatments are only partially effective and not adequate because the extraordinary complexity of the condition has, to date, precluded a sufficient level of understanding for specific and successful treatments to be developed. Since alcoholism is a heterogeneous disorder there is unlikely to be a single effective therapeutic, necessitating the development of a range of options. Fortunately addiction neuroscience is a dynamic field and the quality and quantity of information that is now generated gives hope for the development of more useful treatments in the near future. Alcoholism causes long-lasting neuroadaptations resulting in poor health, brain damage, lost productivity, increased incidence of accidents and injury, violence, loss of social and occupational function and premature death. Ethanol alters brain structure and function in numerous and fundamental ways which persist during abstinence. Each of these long-term neuroadaptations is initiated by changes in gene expression which, with repeated alcohol use, become more permanent. The study of alcohol-induced changes in gene expression can aid in the identification of the molecular targets of ethanol and thereby advance our understanding of this disease. The aim of this thesis was to examine differences in gene expression in the brains of alcoholic and non-alcoholic human subjects. The first part involved the investigation of differentially expressed cDNA fragments identified by a PCR-differential display of the cortex of human alcoholics and controls. This led to the unexpected discovery of an upregulated non-coding RNA (ncRNA) in hippocampus, cerebellum and brainstem of human alcoholics and in hippocampus, cerebellum and cortex of alcohol-treated rats. RNA transcripts which do not encode protein but function as ncRNAs play a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression. Thus the increased ncRNA expression suggests that alcohol may influence the regulation of gene expression via its action on ncRNAs. In recent years the crucial importance of the amygdala in drug-seeking and relapse has been increasingly recognized. The wealth of information generated by microarrays can give a more detailed picture of the molecules which participate in the processes underlying the different forms of synaptic plasticity, so that more comprehensive and sophisticated models of the events underlying the development of alcoholism can be formed. For the second part of this work a 19K microarray was used to compare gene expression in the amygdala of alcoholic patients and control cases. The results show that alcoholism affects a broad range of genes and many systems in the amygdala including genes involved in glutamatergic function, synaptic transmission, structural plasticity, metabolism, transcription and RNA processing, energy metabolism, neurodegeneration, chromatin remodeling and the circadian cycle. The glutamate system is profoundly affected by alcoholism and in the amygdala it is involved in associative learning which plays an important role in alcoholism and other addictions. Downregulation of the excitatory amino acid transporters 1 (GLAST) and 2 (GLT-1) and the AMPA glutamate receptor 2 (GluR2) subunit revealed by the microarray were confirmed quantitatively by Western blots and qualitatively by immunohistochemistry. The decreased expression of GLAST, GLT-1 and GluR2 in the alcoholic patients may increase glutamate tone and activity in the amygdala and this may contribute to neurodegeneration as well as the expression of associative memories and anxiety which underlie continued drug-seeking and chronic relapse.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">brain, alcohol, gene expression</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177605</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Taxing Taxis&#8217;&#8212;Limits and Possibilities for Regulating Tax Compliance Behaviours of Taxi-Drivers: An Australian Case Study</field><field name="creator">Maarten Rothengatter</field><field name="description">Abstract This thesis is both an empirical and theoretical contribution to the study of tax-compliance by taxi-operators and drivers. The exploratory case-study adopts a critical sociological perspective in assessing the limits of both the currently dominant academic literature and the industry-specific legislation on tax conformity, including the most recent strategies and explicit tax-compliance measures from the Australian Tax Office (ATO) with regard to Australian cab-drivers. The core premise of this thesis is that the social and economic activities (both legal and illicit) of cab-drivers are embedded within unique networks of social relations. The study utilises focus-group interviews to explore cabbies&#8217; views on taxation, their perceptions of fairness and trust, and to elucidate how individual taxi-workers justify circumvention of Australian tax laws and regulatory measures in their actual work-practices. This exploration is achieved by analysing the verbal accounts and conversations among cab-drivers that involve their guilt-free justifications for non-compliance. The analysis presents further insights into their &#8220;vocabulary of motives&#8221; and &#8220;aligning actions&#8221; vis-&#224;-vis non-compliant tax behaviour. The respondents&#8217; views and perceptions about trust, and distributive and procedural justice, are compared and contrasted against the tax-regulator&#8217;s views and the ATO&#8217;s current enforcement measures. This study is semi-grounded and qualitative in approach, and is a first contribution to a field of inquiry that appears to be dominated by quantitatively-oriented criminological and social-psychological approaches. In contrast, the case-study presents a sociologically-inspired inquiry, by emphasising that cab-drivers are subjected to a multitude of structural arrangements and social control mechanisms, which influence their attitudes and actions with regard to non-compliance. Moreover, current regulatory initiatives towards diminishing non-compliance in the taxi-industry tend to neglect the concept of &#8220;mixed-embeddedness&#8221; and the inter-relatedness between tax rules, concomitant enforcement practices, and the nation&#8217;s broader legislative framework. The state&#8217;s regulation of tax-compliance behaviour of taxi-drivers cannot strictly be detached from other laws and regulatory measures in areas such as taxi-cab licensing, occupational health &amp; safety (OH&amp;S) or industrial &amp; workplace relations, which affect every taxi-operator and contracted driver, albeit in different ways. A social-action approach that grasps more comprehensively the rich contexts and complexities involved in the informal behaviours of cabbies may be regarded as an additional and powerful information tool in the governance of modern taxation systems. The study will demonstrate how serious tensions and contradictory forces arise when tax regulators attempt to enforce a National Compliance Model which is, of itself, inherently mal-integrated and underpinned typically by a bureaucratic &#8216;one-size-fits-all&#8217; enforcement approach in regard to local networks of taxi-drivers. It will be argued that legislative changes to the (legal) employment status of Australian taxi-drivers may produce a far more expedient and cost-effective way for curtailing the enduring and deeply imbued tax non-compliant modus operandi within this particular sector of Australia&#8217;s transport-services industry.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Keywords: Economic sociology; cash-economy; distributive justice; focus-group interviews; mixed-embeddedness; social networks; tax-compliance; taxi-drivers.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177636</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of a bioinformatic/biochemical hybrid approach to determine the structure of protein complexes and multi domain proteins.</field><field name="creator">Dmitri Mouradov</field><field name="description">A recent shift towards proteomics has seen many structural genomics initiatives set up for high-throughput structure determination using traditional methods of x-ray crystallography and NMR. The next step in the proteomic revolution focuses on the interplay of multi-protein complexes and transient protein-protein interactions, which are involved in many cellular functions. Greater understanding of protein-protein interactions will inevitably lead to better comprehension of the regulation of cellular process, which has implications in biomedical sciences and biotechnology. Even though many high-resolution initiatives focus on proteins and protein complexes, their structure-determination success rates are still low. An emerging approach uses chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry to derive a set of sparse distance constrains, which can be used for building models of proteins and to map out residues in protein interaction interface based on partial structural information. This technique allows low-resolution identification of protein structures and their interactions in cases where traditional structure determination techniques did not produce results. Chemical cross-linkers have been successfully used for many years in identifying interacting proteins. However, recent advances in mass spectrometry have allowed the identification of exact insertion points of low-abundance cross-links and hence has opened up a new perspective on the use of cross-linkers in combination with computational structure prediction. For protein interaction studies, the approach uses chemical cross-linking information with molecular docking, so that the cross-links are treated as explicit constraints in the calculations. This study focuses on a low-cost and rapid approach to structure prediction, where partial structural information and distance constraints can be used to obtain the relative orientation of interacting proteins and domains, specifically as a rescue strategy where traditional high resolution structure determination methods were unsuccessful. This hybrid biochemical/bioinformatics approach was applied in the determination of structure of the latexin:carboxypeptidase A complex, and succeeded in achieving 4 &#197; rmsd compared to the crystal structure determined subsequently (Mouradov et al., 2006). Application of the bioinformatics/biochemical approach to multi-domain proteins was carried out on murine acyl-CoA thioesterase 7 (Acot7). X-ray crystallography provided structures of the two separate domains of Acot7, however the full length protein did not crystalise. Combining chemical cross-linking, mass spectrometry, molecular docking and homology modeling we were able to reconstruct how the two domains are arranged in the full length protein (Forwood et al., 2007). Limitations of this technique caused by the enormous complexity of the cross-linking reaction mixtures were identified and emphasized by analysing a large (four protein) complex of DNA polymerase III, where only one inter-protein cross-link was identified. A rapid and cost-effective method for identification of cross-linked peptides using a commercially available cross-linker was developed as part of the overall aim of streamlining the hybrid biochemical/bioinformatics in order for it to become a generally applicable technique for rapid protein structure characterisation (King et al., 2008). Finally an in-house software package was developed for assignment of cross-linked peptides based on m/z values.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Cross-linking; mass spectrometry; molecular docking; low resolution structure determination</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177658</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Balance of Control between Users and Context-Aware Pervasive Systems</field><field name="creator">Bob Hardian</field><field name="description">Context-awareness in pervasive computing environments can reduce user interactions with computing devices by making applications adaptive and autonomous. Context-aware applications rely on information about user context and user preferences to guide their own behaviour. However, context-aware applications do not always behave as users expect due to imperfection of context information, incorrect user preferences or incorrect adaptation rules. This may cause users to feel loss of control over their applications. To mitigate these problems, context-aware systems must provide mechanisms to strike a suitable balance between user control and software autonomy. Allowing users to scrutinise the system and allowing the system to sometimes include users in the adaptation decision making, can provide a balance of user control. This thesis addresses the shortcoming in development of context-aware pervasive systems with regard to providing balance between user control and software autonomy. The thesis shows that rather than making a context-aware application a complete black box, it is possible to allow user control of application adaptations. The system can reveal to the user what context information the system uses and how it arrives at adaptation decisions if the user requests such information. The user may decide to alter the adaptive behaviour of the system to achieve desired outcomes. Hence, a context-aware application becomes a closed loop system where the user is put into the loop if requested. The proposed approach is developed under an assumption that users differ in the level of their technology expertise and therefore the system has to provide explanations that are suitable for a particular level of user expertise. The thesis makes two important research contributions: design of the architectural framework and development of the platform exposing autonomic behaviour of context-aware applications. The architectural framework supports developers of context aware-applications in providing balance of control between users and software autonomy. The framework describes a set of models that allow revealing the adaptation behaviour of context-aware applications in a way suitable for users with various levels of expertise. The framework consists of: (i) a model for exposing elements that influence the context-aware behaviour, (ii) a generic architecture for providing balance of control, (iii) a user model, and (iv) a context graph based overview of context-aware adaptations. The platform exposing autonomic behaviour of context-aware applications is a proof of concept prototype of a software infrastructure (middleware) providing balance of control. The software infrastructure includes: (i) a Semantic Manager, developed to serve the description of elements required for explanations of the application behaviour; (ii) an extension of the PACE Middleware, to enable the middleware to expose the context information, preferences, adaptation rules and their evaluation traces, respectively. (iii) supporting tools for the application designer to prepare the overview of context-aware adaptations and review the evaluation traces. Finally, this thesis presents a case study that illustrates and evaluates the system supporting balance of control. This evaluation involves the existing application which is developed using the previous version of the PACE middleware. The case study validates the architectural framework and illustrates the process and issues involved in developing context-aware application that are able to expose elements that influence context-aware behaviour.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">balance of control</field><field name="subject">context awareness</field><field name="subject">autonomic computing</field><field name="subject">pervasive systems</field><field name="subject">user interaction</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177659</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Courting Controversies: Salman Rushdie, the Novelist and Intellectual Complicities</field><field name="creator">Sui-sum-grace Wong</field><field name="description">Salman Rushdie is one of the world&#8217;s most pre-eminent writers of contemporary literature. He is best known as a literary author who has written the controversial religious satire in The Satanic Verses, which brought him a prolonged death threat imposed by Islamic authorities. The novel Midnight&#8217;s Children won the prestigious Booker of Bookers prize in 1993 and the Best of the Booker award in 2008. Throughout his writing career, however, he has exceeded his role as a novelist and shown his commitment to using his fame and cultural authority to open debates and publicize his opinions on social and religious issues and world politics. This thesis analyses the various aspects of controversies surrounding Rushdie, as an elite transnational author, a literary celebrity, a public intellectual and an outspoken critic on sensitive topics. It comes to examine the social significance of public personas and the nature of complexity embedded in their career. Rushdie&#8217;s presence draws the media&#8217;s attention, and more often than not, instigates international disputes and contentions. By looking at different aspects of Rushdie&#8217;s identity, the thesis addresses controversies raised by his diverse roles and his traversing of spaces in the cultural industry &#8211; in academia, the book market, public forums, talk shows, celebrity jamborees and even fashion magazine dinner parties. As an elite postcolonial writer, does his iconic status &#8220;compromise&#8221; him in the literary field by the generation of exotic cultural stereotypes and the exploitation of his Indian upbringing? What can literary and cultural critics do to work beyond condemning this trend? As a literary celebrity and public intellectual, do his involvements in publicity activities and New York&#8217;s celebrity circuit make him abandon the professional integrity and the time-honored &#8220;disinterested&#8221; position of the writer? How should the reader understand the connections between the media and the author, and the novel and popular culture? In addition, given his deeply skeptical position on religious matters, how does the writer understand the world of Islam, and how does this understanding underpin his antagonistic relationship with the fundamentalists? Addressing these questions, the thesis is by no means an account of a single writer&#8217;s life and career, but suggests that the complexity of intellectual life in general is made necessary in a cultural landscape saturated with media hype, publicity maneuvers and commoditization. In such contexts, writers exploring their time must, in different degrees, participate actively in what they write against, and be implicated in these processes. Under the influence of the market, the change in social trends and with their aspired career in mind, it seems that there can be no non-involvement for these individuals. Yet, by taking the case of Rushdie, I also argue that implicit in the novelist&#8217;s self-conscious manipulation of his diverse roles and the parodic metafiction in his work are important indications about the image construction of controversial public personas, the cultural meaning of the novelist as a public intellectual, and the implicated career that a writer may have at the turn of the century.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">420000 Language and Culture</field><field name="subject">Controversies</field><field name="subject">Salman Rushdie</field><field name="subject">Novelist</field><field name="subject">Intellectual Complicities</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177662</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impact of a Large Scale Mine Development on the National Economy of Fiji -Issues raised by the proposed Namosi mine-</field><field name="creator">Yoshitaka Hosoi</field><field name="description">Minerals are important natural resources and their development is a historically old, yet new, idea for creating economic prosperity in developing countries. Various researchers have evolved several arguments regarding the impact of mineral resources on development and growth, but they have yet to furnish a practical method of economic evaluation of mineral resources development. This thesis focuses on the economic impact of mineral resource development in a small developing country in the South Pacific Region, namely Fiji. Fiji has expectations and faces challenges in its natural resources development. The Namosi project, a large copper-gold mine development, has been proposed and is under consideration by the Fijian government, who is deliberating on whether mining resources should be developed as a means to add to its prosperity and economic growth or alternatively conserved from the standpoint of the environment and stability. In this study, four significant issues are analyzed viz.: 1) Whether the Namosi mine development project gives a positive net private return. 2) Whether the predicted amount of revenue flowing to the Fijian government from the Namosi mine development exceeds the estimated external cost (in this case, environmental cost) from its development. 3) The impacts of the project on various levels of the Fijian economy, and whether the mine development in Fiji results in an enclave industry; and whether mining has strong or weak backward and forward production linkages with the rest of the Fijian economy. 4) Whether &#8220;Dutch disease&#8221; will ensue from mining development in Fiji and its level of severity. Regarding issue 1) above, Private Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) is conducted by applying the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method to evaluate the Namosi mining project based on financial projections. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is conducted in order to allow for possible variations in copper and gold prices. This analysis indicates that given the anticipated metal prices, private returns from this mining development are likely to be positive. Indeed, the current high metal prices would lead to high private returns. Regarding issue 2) above, Social Cost-Benefit Analyses are attempted. Under the given circumstances, the results show that the benefits of the mine project, as a whole for its 29-year life, substantially outweigh the environmental costs of the project to Fiji. However, due to a lack of available data on the economic magnitude of environmental spillovers, only estimates of environmental costs of the Namosi mining development could be made. Regarding issue 3) above, Input-Output model analysis is performed. Fiji&#8217;s total output (without production from the Namosi mine) is found to be F$5,529.917 million. It is estimated that the Namosi project will increase the output of Fiji directly by F$465.574 million (which includes the production inducement effect) and will result in an increase of F$543.788 million in overall Fijian output (GDP). This increase will also be followed by an increased output of about F$10-30 million in related industries, such as in the commerce, transport, and insurance sectors. Based on this Input-Output analysis, it is found that Fiji&#8217;s mining sector is an export-oriented enclave industry and that the mining industry itself has very little influence on economic activity in other sectors of the economy. Regarding issue 4) above, the Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model analysis is applied. Evidence of the likely occurrence of Dutch disease can be detected from output indicators of each industry, consumer prices and exports. Examples of Dutch disease are as follows: a decrease in output of agricultural industries and in export-oriented domestic industries; an increase in consumer prices (inflation); a decrease of exports both in exportable agricultural products and in manufactured products oriented to exports. However, several macro-variables improve, such as employees&#8217; income, trade (exports and imports), tax revenue, tariff revenue, VAT revenue, government account (savings and expenditure) and GDP etc. These results suggest that there could be a major increase in national welfare. Thus, from an economics point of view, it has been found (by comparing gains in Fijian government revenue with potential Fijian environmental costs) that it is very likely that development of the Namosi mine will result in a net social gain to Fiji. These results are based on the application of principles of social cost-benefit analysis and indicate that a Kaldor-Hicks improvement (a potential Pareto improvement) is likely for Fiji as a result of the mining development. This means that from the predicted net revenue gains of the Fijian government from mining, those who suffer environmental losses would be compensated and the government would still have some extra revenue left over. An actual Paretian improvement is also possible.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">340000 Economics</field><field name="subject">natural resources, mineral resource development, economic development, economic impact, environmental impact, resource curse, Dutch disease, cost-benefit analysis, input-output model analysis, computable general equilibrium model analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177663</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of Patched1 in Epidermal Homeostasis</field><field name="creator">Rehan Villani</field><field name="description">Abstract &#8211; The Role of Patched1 in Epidermal Homeostasis Hedgehog (Hh) signalling is a critical pathway involved in the development of many, if not all, organ systems. However the abnormal activation of Hh signalling in fully developed adult organs leads to cancer. Mutation of the Hh signal receptor, Patched1 (Ptc1), causes Naevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome, which presents with developmental defects and cancer predisposition. The activation of Hh signalling is seen in a wide range of non-inherited cancer types also, including Medulloblastoma and Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) of the skin. BCC is the most common form of human cancer and over 90% of cases are linked to abnormally high Hh signalling. Hh signalling is known to regulate hair follicle morphogenesis during development and more recently has been linked to modulation of the embryonic epidermal stem cell compartment. However both the mechanisms behind this process and the mechanism behind its induction of BCC are still uncharacterised. The aim of this project was to determine the role of Ptc1 in the skin, particularly the adult stem cell compartment, and the role of Hh signalling in BCC formation. The deletion of Ptc1 specifically in the adult epidermis was enabled by the creation of a K14-Cre Recombinase induced Ptc1 Conditional (K14-Cre:Ptc1C/C) transgenic mouse line. Proliferation was increased throughout the epithelia and BCC-like lesions developed within 4 weeks of Ptc1 deletion. This indicates that Hh signalling plays a critical role in repressing cell turnover in the interfollicular epithelium (IFE) and bulge region in the adult despite being previously reported not to play a role in this area. Ptc1 deletion in the epithelia was also found to promote the IFE lineage over hair follicles and expand the expression of many proposed stem cell markers, including K15, Sox9 and p63. K14-Cre:Ptc1C/C transgenic mice also exhibited a severe growth defect, linked to low levels of Igf1 hormone in the serum. Igf1 binding protein alteration in the skin was determined to be the most likely cause and prompted the investigation of Igf axis signalling in Ptc1 deleted epidermis. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 was found to localise to the bulge or stem cell region of the hair follicle, and was increased in K14-Cre:Ptc1C/C epidermis. Igfbp2 was coincident with a loss of PI3K/Akt signal translation. The majority of human BCC samples also expressed Igfbp2 at much higher levels than surrounding normal tissue indicating these results are relevant to the human BCC condition also. Interestingly Hh activation was also shown to increase p38 MAPK throughout the epidermis indicating it is a universal target of Hh signalling in the skin. In summary we have found that Hh signal activation in the epidermis promotes the bulge/stem cell and interfollicular lineages of the skin at the expense of hair follicles. Finally the modulation of PI3K/Akt signalling by Igfbp2 in the bulge is perhaps mediating the effect of Hh signalling via the promotion of the bulge lineage leading to the development of BCC.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">patched1</field><field name="subject">skin</field><field name="subject">hedgehog</field><field name="subject">epidermal</field><field name="subject">homeostasis</field><field name="subject">insulin-like growth factor</field><field name="subject">tyrosine kinase</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177768</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cognitive training, conflict resolution, and exercise: Effects on young adolescents' well being</field><field name="creator">Mark Taylor</field><field name="description">Abstract By 2020 the World Health Organisation has predicted that depression will be the largest cause of disease burden in the world (Ellen, 2002). This study investigated the effects of three interventions (Explanatory Style, Conflict Resolution, and Exercise) on the level of well-being of adolescents from the middle years of schooling. The research consisted of three studies. Study 1 involved the design of a Student Perception Questionnaire. The 28&#172;&#8211;item Student Perception Questionnaire was created to measure the outcomes of the three interventions and was trialled on 215 Middle School students. A Principal Components analysis with Varimax rotation was performed on the data retrieved from the respondents, and all items were retained on the questionnaire, although four factors did not show a .30 loading. Study 2, a Pilot Study, was conducted with three students to trial the interventions and measures in preparation for the final study. It included the collection of qualitative and quantitative data. The qualitative data was gained from interviews held with the students, parents, and teachers. Study 2 revealed that the interventions and the measures used to determine the effectiveness of the interventions would be suitable for Study 3. Study 3 was the full intervention that involved 25 students in an intervention group and six students in a no-intervention group. The 25 students were allocated to six groups that were engaged in a counterbalanced design study using the Explanatory Style, Conflict Resolution, and Exercise interventions. The group of six students was used as a comparison group. The results showed that students in the intervention group experienced a reduction of internalising behaviours such as withdrawal and depressive symptoms following all three interventions. The program as a whole was successful in reducing depressive symptoms and the interventions individually also significantly reduced depressive symptoms. The intervention group developed more optimistic thinking styles following the explanatory style intervention. Analysis of parent data revealed that parents of the intervention group were experiencing significant feelings of incompetence and guilt towards themselves as parents. In the members of the no-intervention group, having good social skills and a strong support network of friends and family were protective factors against depressive symptoms. The thesis showed that interventions can be used with adolescents that are effective in reducing depressive symptoms and do not have negative side effects, such as those associated with medications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Cognitive training, conflict resolution, exercise, adolescents, well being</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177781</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coping with miscarriage: Australian women's experiences</field><field name="creator">Ingrid Rowlands</field><field name="description">This thesis combines quantitative and qualitative methods to examine both women&#8217;s psychological wellbeing after miscarriage and the specific coping strategies that are associated with coping well with this event. Chapter 1 reviews the ways in which miscarriage has been defined and its estimated prevalence. As definitions of miscarriage tend to vary across Western countries, the research implications of this are discussed. Chapter 2 reviews the literature related to women&#8217;s psychological responses following miscarriage, discussing the main outcomes which have been examined, including depression, anxiety, stress and grief. As the literature is relatively small, and current research is limited by small and non-representative samples, Chapter 3 takes an epidemiological approach by cross-sectionally investigating the psychological correlates, and relevant sociodemographic, reproductive and health-related variables associated with miscarriage using a large population sample of young Australian women. Sociodemographic and reproductive variables most strongly predicted membership of the Miscarriage and No Miscarriage groups, while psychological wellbeing did not distinguish the two groups in the stepwise logistic regression. Using the same data but applying longitudinal methods, Chapter 4 examined whether trajectories of Mental Health, Stress and Optimism varied over time and according to women&#8217;s miscarriage status. Relevant sociodemographic and reproductive variables identified in Chapter 3 as possible confounding variables were controlled in these analyses. Miscarriage was found to affect trajectories of Mental Health, Stress and Optimism, with poorer outcomes on all variables for women reporting miscarriage by comparison to women who had never miscarried over a seven-year period. Because miscarriage has significant effects on women&#8217;s mental health and wellbeing, the next part of the thesis was dedicated to examining the predictors of, and coping strategies related to, coping well after miscarriage. Since the term coping well is not easily defined, Chapter 5 is a critical review of the theoretical frameworks of coping, with an emphasis on identifying the conceptualisation and measurement problems which have limited advancements in the field. Chapter 6 is a review of the psychological, reproductive and sociodemographic predictors of adjustment to miscarriage, highlighting the conflicting evidence and the need for multivariate methods when analysing these relationships. Using the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women&#8217;s Health data, Chapter 7 uses longitudinal methods to investigate predictors of Mental Health among young women reporting miscarriage. Optimism, social support and the number of miscarriages were strong predictors of Mental Health among women reporting miscarriage. Chapter 8 is a review of the research which has examined the coping styles and strategies that women use to cope with miscarriage. The majority of this research tends to be of a qualitative nature, and therefore the next step was to complete interviews with nine women to gain a more in-depth understanding of the specific coping strategies related to positive outcomes after miscarriage. Social support was reported as facilitating adjustment to miscarriage, consistent with the quantitative analyses. Acknowledgement and support from health professionals was also described as facilitating adjustment. While the quantitative analyses had also initially suggested that satisfaction with the general practitioner was an important predictor of adjustment, this variable did not reach significance when other reproductive and psychological variables were controlled for. Taking all the results into consideration, it appears that changes to social norms and attitudes regarding miscarriage may help women to cope with this challenging and distressing experience. Interventions to help women cope with miscarriage need to be grounded in an understanding of women&#8217;s need for social and family support, and understanding from health professionals. However, it is essential that interventions should be comprehensively evaluated, and future research in this area is warranted.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Miscarriage</field><field name="subject">coping</field><field name="subject">Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health</field><field name="subject">mental health</field><field name="subject">Stress</field><field name="subject">Optimism</field><field name="subject">qualitative</field><field name="subject">Social support</field><field name="subject">multilevel modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177791</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measuring and Improving Performance in Facilities Management: The Complex Case of Satisfying Stakeholders in Shopping Centres</field><field name="creator">Wing-lun Arnold Kwok</field><field name="description">Abstract Facilities management (FM) has been identified as a significant contributor to the overall economy of Australia. Its focus is not only the maintenance of property but also the operation of business. Measuring and improving performance in the FM of buildings is becoming important for organisations to create stakeholder satisfaction. Among various FM performance indicators and measurement approaches, choosing the right ones is always difficult. Besides, FM lacks a commonly-agreed or generally-accepted definition of what it entails and a theory of what it does. Its unclear scope and activities are a clear gap in the current state of knowledge. The recognition of the interrelatedness of these aspects is important and leads to the research question for the current project, namely: How can performance be measured and improved in the FM of buildings to satisfy different stakeholders? The project&#8217;s aim is to answer this research question by broadening the traditional scope of FM to acknowledge the situation of various relevant stakeholders (people); by offering a new demand-side approach (process) to measure performance; and demonstrating ways to use that means to improve the FM of the built environment (space). Acknowledging the importance of independent research skills and the ability to relate a specific topic to a broad framework of knowledge, this project contributes specific knowledge about the FM industry. A new approach (a virtuous cycle of integrated FM) is developed not only to link the input of facilities and services with the output of business operations, but also to allow multiple stakeholders to participate in decision-making. As demonstrated by the theoretical outcomes, customers are central among other stakeholders to business operations and they have patently different views and management outlooks on FM from the supply-side parties, namely, owners, managers and some tenants. Thus, a balanced approach for all stakeholders in an organisation is required to minimise the effect of asymmetric, imperfect and incomplete information. In addition to &#8220;best practice&#8221; reckoning which has been widely applied in organisations for years, this research recommends a &#8220;best match&#8221; approach. The answer to the research question emerges in the form of a performance flowchart with a list of operational tasks, which act as guidelines to acknowledge the situation of various relevant stakeholders, measure performance, and demonstrate ways to improve the FM of the built environment. Importantly, the research is not only directed at grounded theory-building; it acts as a pioneering pilot study to stimulate discussion among professionals and specialists, contribute to the current FM field and provide a basis for future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="subject">facilities management, performance measurement, stakeholders, stakeholders satisfaction</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177800</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of Lifestyle and Metabolic Factors in Renal Transplant Recipients</field><field name="creator">Linda Orazio</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT Introduction: Renal transplant recipients (RTR) with abnormal glucose tolerance (AGT) are at an increased risk of graft failure and cardiovascular disease (CVD). CVD is the major cause of death in RTR. Whilst there are numerous known risk factors for AGT in RTR, it is unknown whether lifestyle factors are found in the presence or play a role in the development of AGT in RTR. The nutritional status of RTR in an Australian population has also not been extensively investigated. Investigation into these areas could help identify modifiable areas for change in the RTR population. Multidisciplinary lifestyle modification, including diet and physical activity (PA) advice from a dietitian, may help reduce modifiable risk factors for CVD in RTR with AGT. Aims: The principle aims of this thesis are to; 1) assess the incidence of obesity and central obesity in RTR and compare to rates in the general Australian population, 2) investigate and compare modifiable lifestyle factors and adipokine levels in RTR with AGT and normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and 3) investigate the effect of a multidisciplinary lifestyle intervention (including dietetic advice) on modifiable CVD risk factors in RTR with AGT. Methods: Chapter 1 presents a review of the literature describing the main nutritional challenges in RTR, cardiovascular risk factors in RTR including adipokine profiles and the role of body composition, diet and PA in RTR. Chapter 2 details the clinical, biochemical, nutritional, body composition, PA and statistical methodologies used in this thesis. In Chapter 3 a descriptive analysis of the anthropometry and cardiovascular risk profile of RTR in an Australian setting is investigated. Chapter 4 investigates the nutritional status of RTR with NGT and AGT in more detail, assessing diet, PA, adipokines and body composition. In Chapter 5, the current literature on lifestyle intervention management (including nutritional management) for obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus in the general population is discussed. Building on previous chapters, Chapter 6 investigates the effect of a multi-disciplinary lifestyle intervention (with dietetic input) on modifiable cardiovascular risk factors in RTR with AGT. Results: In Chapter 3 it was found that RTR are significantly more centrally obese than those in the general population, and this was particularly the case in younger RTR. Central obesity was associated with CVD risk factors in RTR. Chapter 4 found that a lower level of PA, obesity and central obesity are associated with AGT in RTR, whereas no difference in adipokines or dietary intake was found. In Chapter 6, multidisciplinary lifestyle intervention with dietetic input was found to improve certain risk factors for CVD in RTR with AGT, such as dietary factors (total fat and saturated fat intake) and lipid levels. Conclusions: Central obesity is a common problem in RTR, particularly in those with AGT. Higher levels of PA are associated with lower risk of AGT in RTR, and may help reduce the incidence of central obesity in RTR. Multidisciplinary lifestyle intervention, with dietetic input, can improve some modifiable CVD risk factors in RTR with AGT, however more intensive intervention is required to significantly reduce the incidence of obesity.

They fulfill various functions in human beings, which makes them a long studied substance in medicine and biology. Furthermore they possess a set of rare and special physico-chemical properties which include featureless broad band absorption in the UV-Vis spectrum and condensed phase electrical conduction. Many scientists have interpreted their findings in terms of an amorphous semiconductor model, but this was done under the a priori assumption that charge transport in melanin is electronic. However, a very strong dependence of melanin&#8217;s electrical properties on its level of hydration has recently led to speculations that the dominant charge carrier for high hydration is of protonic rather than electronic nature. This thesis will present direct evidence for electronic charge transport, found by investigating the influence of different environmental parameters on the conductivity of melanin. It will furthermore be shown that the hydration dependent conductivity of melanin can be understood in terms of a dielectric response model for an amorphous semiconductor. This establishment of the major charge carrier is an important step in the on-going effort to fully map the structure-property relationship of melanin and will help to understand its function in vivo. With the ultimate goal to make use of melanin&#8217;s fascinating properties, thin films, a new class of device has been characterized and investigated. These thin films, while exhibiting melanin&#8217;s characteristics, show improved mechanical stability, a very uniform morphology and a much faster response than standard pellet samples. They are furthermore applicable to standard polymer processing techniques which brings technological applications within reach.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Melanin</field><field name="subject">thin film</field><field name="subject">van der Pauw measurement</field><field name="subject">Electrical Properties</field><field name="subject">Percolation Concepts</field><field name="subject">charge transport</field><field name="subject">eumelanin</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177880</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From Son to High Priest: The Christological Rhetoric of Hebrews</field><field name="creator">David Thiele</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with the Christology of the book of Hebrews, specifically the relationship between the Christological categories of "Son" and "high priest". It is argued here that the rationale for the introduction of a priestly Christology has been insufficiently considered in previous scholarly work on Hebrews Furthermore, in previous studies insufficient consideration has been given to the way in which the interrelationship of the categories of sonship and priesthood functions in the rhetorical structure of Hebrews. This thesis argues that a form of "second Adam" Christology lies behind the Christological thought of Hebrews. It consequently endeavours to establish the rationale for the introduction of priestly Christology by exploring those "second Adam" ideas. Until the 1970s historical-critical methodologies dominated in the study of Hebrews. This is one of the reasons for the lack of scholarly consideration of the interrelationship of the priestly and filial Christological categories in the rhetoric of Hebrews. This thesis underscores the deficiencies of the historical-critical approaches to Hebrews as highlighted by the paucity of results such approaches have produced. It is argued that rhetorical criticism is an appropriate methodology for supplementing more historical-oriented methodologies. A survey of previous rhetorical-critical work on Hebrews is undertaken with a view to showing the potential of rhetorical-critical study of the book. It is argued that the rhetorical purposes of Hebrews is the bolstering of the community's confidence in their confession of faith. Acceptance of such an understanding of purpose leads naturally to the further question of the content of that confession, and specifically to the issue of whether or not it contained a statement of the priesthood of Christ. It is argued that the confession of the Hebrews did not refer to the priesthood of Christ, but can rather be summarized as "Jesus is the Son of God". The core of this thesis is found in a careful exegesis of Heb 2 which is crucial for understanding the relationship of the sonship and priesthood of Jesus in Hebrews. This chapter is introduced by explicit references to Jesus as Son (in Hebrews 1:5-14) and ends with the first explicit application of the word "priest" to him (2:17). It is argued that the underlying Adamic and Edenic themes in the chapter provide the key to understanding the relationship. The significance of such Adamic/Eden themes lies at the heart of this thesis. The rest of Hebrews is then examined with a view to ascertaining if such Adamic/Edenic themes are utilized elsewhere in the work. The rhetorical significance of the Adamic/Edenic allusions found throughout Hebrews is also explored. It is argued that the pattern of usage strongly suggests that Adamic/Edenic themes constitute "common ground" between Auctor and his recipients, which is presupposed in the overall argument of Hebrews rather than being argued in detail. The thesis concludes with a summary of the work as a whole, a statement of conclusions arrived at and an outline various implications arising from it.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Christology, sonship, priesthood, Adam, Adamic, rhetoric, rhetorical, eschatology, eschatological, Hebrews</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177931</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Brominated flame retardants - sources and exposure pathways</field><field name="creator">Leisa-Maree LeontjewToms</field><field name="description">Summary Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are a class of brominated flame retardants. The addition of these chemicals to electrical and electronic equipment, building materials, carpet and textiles reduces flammability and therefore harm and destruction caused by unwanted fire. These chemicals are now internationally ubiquitous in the environment and humans because of their increased usage and physical and chemical properties of persistence and lipophilicity. Although Australian data on both the concentrations and the sources and exposure pathways was limited, a preliminary study of PBDEs in 10 pools of human blood serum revealed that concentrations of PBDEs in Australia were comparatively higher than most countries with the exception of Canada and the USA. The aim of this project was to determine the concentrations of PBDEs in the Australian population and to examine the possible sources and pathways of exposure in humans. Experimental evaluation of PBDE exposure matrices included samples of: sediment (n=46), air (n=19), dust (n=19), surface wipes (n=10) and human milk (157 samples combined into 17 pools, n=10 individual samples); and the general population using human blood serum (10552 samples combined into 169 pools). With accumulating evidence regarding age differences in PBDE concentrations, the scope of this project was broadened to include a focus on infants and young children. This study found that PBDE contamination was widespread in the Australian environment and human population. In sediment, PBDEs were relatively low at the majority of sites with mean &#177; standard deviation and median &#931;PBDE concentrations across all sites of 4707 &#177; 12580 and 305 pg g-1 dw, respectively. There were elevated concentrations found downstream of sewerage treatment plants; in areas dominated by industrial and urban land-use types; and in estuarine compared to freshwater environments. PBDEs were detected in air, dust and surface wipes. Concentrations on the whole were found to be higher indoors compared to outdoors and in offices compared to homes. &#931;PBDE concentrations ranged from 0.5 -179 pg/m3 for homes and 15 - 487 pg/m3 for offices and at the two outdoor sites the concentrations were 1.7 and 6.8 pg/m3. PBDEs were detected on 9 out of 10 surfaces (e.g. television, refrigerator, DVD player) sampled and ranged from non-detectable to 5985 pg/cm2 while in dust, &#931;PBDEs ranged from 87 - 733 ng/g dust in homes and 583 - 3070 ng/g dust in offices. PBDEs were detected in all individual and pooled samples of human milk and blood serum and the &#931;PBDE and BDE-47 concentrations ranged from 5.5 to 103 and 0.6 to 55 ng/g lipid, respectively. There were no regional differences in concentrations in human milk or blood serum and in general PBDE concentrations were higher in males than in females. Although no temporal trend was apparent in samples of human milk or blood serum collected between 2002 and 2008, the ban on penta- and octa-BDE commercial products in several countries has only been in place since 2004. Hence, effects of the ban may not be reflected in human body burden for several years. The concentrations of PBDEs were found to be highest in young children aged 2 &#8211; 5 years of age where concentrations were up to 10 times greater than those detected in adults. Congener profiles for sediment, air, dust and surface wipes were mostly dominated by BDE-209. In human milk and serum, BDE-47 was dominant while BDE-209 contributed only 3% in human milk and was not determined in serum. Concentrations of PBDEs found in Australian human and environmental samples were lower than those reported from North America but higher than those reported from Europe and Asia. The results of modeling and the assessment of matched samples of human milk, indoor air and dust showed that body burden could be partly explained by exposure via food, air, dust and human milk as well as clearance (half-life) data. However, the higher than expected concentrations in young children indicated that there are likely to be missing sources and exposure pathways and/ or the clearance data is inaccurate. The results of this thesis provide baseline data on PBDE concentrations in Australia and will prove important for long term monitoring of the effect of changes in usage rates of these chemicals. It is important to understand the specific sources and exposure pathways of PBDEs in infants and young children in order to identify intervention methods whereby exposure to this vulnerable population can be reduced. In terms of the future use of PBDEs or other flame retardant chemicals, it is important that the risk-benefit ratio is regulated so that the minimization of human exposure and potential associated negative health effects is balanced with the reduction of harm caused by fire.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brominated flame retardants</field><field name="subject">Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers</field><field name="subject">PBDEs</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">sources</field><field name="subject">exposure pathways</field><field name="subject">human intake</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177933</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of Fucoidin efficacy in A&#946;-peptide induced Alzheimer&#8217;s disease rodent model</field><field name="creator">Aarti Patel</field><field name="description">Abstract Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) is a major public health concern worldwide, with an increasing prevalence in the elderly population. AD is a progressive neurological disorder of multi-faceted origin, where factors such as genetic mutations, biochemical changes, along with inflammatory cascade and soluble beta amyloid (A&#946;) peptide, are thought to play a pivotal role in synaptic failure and neuronal death, ultimately leading to cognitive and neuropsychiatric decline in patients suffering from the disease. At present, there is no long-term cure for the disease, although there is access to pharmacotherapy that might improve cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms early in the course of the disease. The current pharmacological therapy for AD only provides symptomatic relief for a very short period of time. It is therefore of utmost importance to discover other pharmacological strategies that might delay the development of AD and slow down the disease progression in terms of cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Elucidating the pathogenic mechanisms involved in AD neuropathogenesis is a major goal to find efficacious disease-modifying treatments. What remains to be understood completely are the intracellular pathways affected by A&#946; protein which may lead to neurodegeneration in AD. Since phosphorylation and dephosphorylation mechanisms are crucial in the &#946;-amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, protein kinase C has emerged as one of the key regulators of the APP metabolism. Indeed, dysregulation of the PKC pathway might play a role in the intracellular mechanisms of neurodegeneration, but their effective involvement still remains elusive. Therefore, a detailed analysis of PKC pathways in established models of AD neurodegeneration is necessary and will form part of this work. Fucoidin is a sulphated polysaccharide extracted from edible brown seaweed, which has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects as well as being a neuroprotectant in various inflammatory diseases including hypoxic ischemia, atherosclerosis and Heyman nephritis. Therefore, fucoidin may have an inhibitory effect on the inflammatory mechanisms of AD. Little is known, however, about the effect of fucoidin on AD. Animal models of AD are extremely valuable for the discovery and development of new treatments. Rodents have been one of the preferred models for pharmacological and behavioural studies in AD. In this thesis, first aim was to establish a non-transgenic A&#946;-induced AD model in rats. AD was induced utilising a published protocol which involved the bilateral injection of aggregated A&#946; (1-42) into the CA3 subfield of the hippocampus in rat brain. Behavioural assessment with well defined tools such as the Morris water maze and T-maze were utilised to assess the impairment in spatial working memory in rats. Behavioural impairments along with increased astrocytosis and microgliosis were observed in this particular A&#946;-induced AD model. In the established disease model, fucoidin (50 mg/kg/day and 25 mg/kg/day) and ibuprofen (50 mg/kg/day) were shown to provide a partial protective effect on impairment in memory function in the MWM behavioural task in rats treated prior to disease initiation and throughout the course of the study. In addition, the histopathological and quantitative analysis of AD brain sections showed a marked reduction in reactive glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and microglia in fucoidin (low and high dose) and ibuprofen treated A&#946; injected rats compared to untreated A&#946; injected rats. These results indicate that fucoidin may serve as a possible effective therapeutic approach to improve AD symptoms. There is strong evidence that PKC &#945; and &#949; signalling pathways regulate important molecular events in memory impairment and neurodegenerative pathophysiology in AD. A possible neuroprotective mechanism of fucoidin involving attenuation of an A&#946;-induced decrease in PKC &#949; phosphorylation using cultured SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells as a model system was examined. Co-administration of fucoidin (2&#956;M and 5 &#956;M) with A&#946; (1&#956;M) abolished the inhibitory effect of A&#946; on the phosphorylation of PKC&#949; in a concentration-dependent manner as revealed by western blot analysis. These findings suggest that a possible mechanism underpinning the neuroprotective effect of fucoidin may be through prevention of A&#61538;-induced inhibition of PKC phosphorylation and may serve as a possible therapeutic approach to improve AD symptoms. As cellular events that involve PKC are affected by A&#946; in in vitro systems, it was necessary to examine whether PKC activity is also modulated by the A&#946; treatment in vivo in our A&#946;-peptide induced AD model. Therefore, the next aim was to assess the potential for fucoidin use as an intervention therapy in an established disease stage in the A&#946;-peptide induced AD model. Intervention with fucoidin (50 mg/kg/day, i.p.) in the established disease stage partially prevented A&#946; (1-42) mediated damage with respect to memory impairment, neuroinflammation and PKC &#949; phosphorylation in the in vivo AD model consistent with the in vitro findings in SHSY5Y cells.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alzheimer Disease, amyloid beta peptide, fucoidin, PKC</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177944</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ovarian cancer and diet: from nutrients to lifestyle</field><field name="creator">Fariba Kolahdooz</field><field name="description">Abstract Ovarian cancer is the 6th most common cancer in women worldwide and mortality from this cancer is high, because early diagnosis is difficult (Sankaranarayanan et al. 2006). Thus, identification of modifiable factors contributing to its aetiology is important in reducing the burden of a very fatal form of women&#8217;s cancer. The overall aim of this thesis was to investigate the association between diet and ovarian cancer risk within the context of a framework &#8216;from nutrients to lifestyle&#8217;. The study examined dietary and lifestyle factors that had not previously been investigated comprehensively in four main areas: nutrients (retinol, beta-carotene, vitamins E, C, and B), foods (fruit, vegetables, dairy products, eggs, meat and liver), diet patterns and lifestyle (smoking, alcohol, and body-mass-index). The study used the data from two population-based case-control studies of women aged 18-79 years conducted in Australia 10 years apart; the Survey of Women&#8217;s Health (SWH, 1990-1993) involves 683 cases and 777 controls, and the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study (AOCS, 2002-2005) includes 1329 cases and 1397 controls. Cases were recruited from gynaecological oncology treatment centres and controls were selected at random from the electoral roll. Detailed information on non-dietary risk factors was obtained using a questionnaire and dietary information was obtained via a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) (adjusting for age, parity, oral contraceptive use, education, and energy intake) for ovarian cancer risk were estimated separately for each study with logistic regression modelling and weighted pooled risk estimates for the two studies were calculated using fixed-effects models. Principal components analysis of around 40 food groups was performed to identify dietary patterns in each study separately. There was an increased risk of ovarian cancer associated with retinol intake in both studies (combined OR for the highest vs. lowest quartile =1.42, 95%CI 1.19-1.69), while intake of beta-carotene was inversely related to cancer risk (combined OR=0.80, 95%CI 0.67-0.96). The associations between retinol and beta-carotene and risk appeared to be independent. Liver was also associated with an increased risk; however this association seemed to be explained by the high levels of retinol in liver. Dairy products and eggs are other good sources of retinol, but no clear relations were seen and additional adjustment for saturated fat further attenuated the associations. High vitamin E intake (combined OR=0.73, 95%CI 0.61-0.87) was associated with a decreased risk, but no overall association was seen for vitamin C (combined OR=1.06, 95%CI 0.89-1.27). It is noteworthy that vitamin C seemed to be more beneficial for current smokers than for never/past smokers. For the B vitamins, a significant inverse association was apparent only for niacin intake (combined OR=0.69, 95%CI 0.58-0.82). While there was no association between cancer risk and sources of niacin such as total meat and red meat, other niacin-rich foods such as poultry (combined OR=0.77, 95%CI 0.66-0.89) and fish (combined OR=0.83, 95%CI 0.71-0.97) were significantly inversely associated with risk. In contrast to poultry and fish, high consumption of processed meat was associated with a 24% increase in risk (combined OR=1.24, 95%CI 1.06-1.45). Total fruit (combined OR=0.75, 95%CI 0.60-0.94) and total vegetables (combined OR=0.69, 95%CI 0.52-0.92), specifically cruciferous vegetables (combined OR=0.79, 95%CI 0.63-0.98) and green leafy vegetables (combined OR=0.79, 95%CI 0.67-0.94), were associated with a modestly decreased risk, whereas the inverse association between red/yellow vegetables and risk did not quite reach statistical significance (combined OR=0.84, 95%CI 0.64-1.08). High fruit intake was, like vitamin C intake, somewhat more beneficial for current/past smokers than for never smokers. Exclusion of women who took dietary supplements did not substantially change the observed associations between nutrients and risk. Three major eating patterns were identified: &#8216;snacks and alcohol&#8217;, &#8216;fruit and vegetable&#8217;, and &#8216;meat and fat&#8217;. Significant inverse associations between the snacks and alcohol pattern and risk were attenuated after further adjustment for white/red wine intake in both studies; it thus appeared that the observed association was at least partly due to wine intake. A significant association between the fruit and vegetable pattern and risk was seen only in the more recent study. A diet characterized by high meat and fat was associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer, although the observed association was stronger in the SWH There was no evidence that the associations between diet pattern and cancer risk varied by women&#8217;s lifestyle. Although there was some variation in the analyses stratified by the histologic subtype of ovarian cancer, no consistent patterns of variation were observed for either study. These findings provide additional evidence that a healthy diet defined by high intake of fruit, vegetables, particularly cruciferous and green leafy vegetables, white meat and fish and low in meat and fat, especially processed meats might be beneficial against ovarian cancer.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">diet, nutrient, food group, diet pattern, lifestyle, ovarian neoplasm, cancer</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177954</field></doc><doc><field name="title">BRAIN MAPPING OF ACUPUNCTURE EFFECTS USING FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING</field><field name="creator">Mark Strudwick</field><field name="description">There remains a high degree of scepticism about acupuncture since its theoretical basis has no clear reference in Western medical and scientific terms, making any associations between neurophysiology and specific acupuncture concepts difficult to determine. Using neuroimaging and engineering approaches to understand its physiological basis may engender greater acceptance of and improvement in the clinical application of acupuncture. Research into the efficacy of acupuncture has raised a number of difficult methodological issues, particularly in relation to the selection of appropriate controls. Separating specific effects from non-specific effects is complex because acupuncture is a physical, invasive, manual procedure involving time and ritual. Sham acupuncture results show only the difference between sham and real acupuncture not the real affect of acupuncture, and other controls may produce distinct subjective and objective effects. Point injection (the injection of a small amount of a substance at an acupoint), a recent innovation of traditional acupuncture, aims to enhance and prolong the stimulation effect in a standardised, reproducible manner. By providing precise, measurable acupoint stimulation applied incrementally in a specifically designed paradigm, an acupoint could act as its own control. This firstly requires injection to be validated against traditional needling. Aims 1. To develop an instrument for reproducible saline delivery at an acupoint. 2. To cross-validate saline acupoint injection (PI) with traditional needle acupuncture (TA). 3. To demonstrate central nervous system (CNS) effects of acupuncture both in health and chronic pain. Hypothesis The primary hypothesis is that stimulation of specific acupoints with linearly incremental saline injection produces differential effects within the CNS observable with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allowing investigation of acupuncture in health and chronic pain. Novelty As neuroimaging has not yet clearly defined the brain structures that may be modulated by acupuncture, this project is exploratory in nature. It is expected that acupuncture effects can be robustly imaged with fMRI in healthy subjects and those suffering chronic pain. The demonstrated effects will result from the acupuncture process of progressive point stimulation by tissue distension rather than needle insertion or biological noise. It is proposed to examine the putative modulation of pain by acupuncture within the extensively mapped neuromatrix of cortical and subcortical regions, including the somatic, insula, and limbic cortices, and thalamus. Detailed information regarding differences in brain response between acupuncture in normal and diseased states will expand understanding of acupuncture as a clinical tool. The dilemma of sham stimulation or arbitrary controls will be addressed by confirming PI as a valid, reproducible stimulation method. Methods and Results A series of empirical experiments was designed and conducted to determine the effects of stimulation of different acupoints. 1. Chapters 1 and 3 outline the current understanding of acupuncture in the Western milieu and a review of the neuroimaging literature respectively. 2. In Chapter 2, the report of PI tested against TA in healthy volunteers to determine equivalence of physiological effect demonstrates no statistically significant differences between the methodologies. 3. Chapter 4 reports the design and validation of a task specific microprocessor controlled syringe driver. 4. Four differing acupoints were tested during an fMRI experiment described in Chapter 5; different activation areas were demonstrated across the acupoints providing early support for the hypothesis that different acupoints may have different effects. A subset of brain areas recognised within the pain neuromatrix was delineated, congruent spatially and directionally with those reported in pharmacological analgesia studies. 5. As outlined in Chapter 6, heart rate variability can be measured rapidly in a stressful environment to provide meaningful data on the response of the autonomic nervous system to acupuncture stimulation. 6. The hypothesis of different acupoints having different effects was tested in subjects suffering chronic pain by contrasting an accepted and a neutral acupoint, the results being reported in Chapter 7. Conclusion Despite a long history of clinical usage, appropriate scientific studies have not yet addressed the basic effectiveness and efficacy of acupuncture. This thesis presents a series of empirical studies designed to address a number of the questions arising in the literature and provides converging evidence of the manner in which different acupoints modulate the CNS, specifically within the pain neuromatrix.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acupuncture</field><field name="subject">complementary medicine</field><field name="subject">functional magnetic resonance imaging</field><field name="subject">magnetic resonance imaging</field><field name="subject">Neuroimaging</field><field name="subject">central nervous system</field><field name="subject">Peripheral Neuropathy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177977</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Generation and characterization of a life-shortening Wolbachia infection in the dengue vector Aedes aegypti</field><field name="creator">Conor James McMeniman</field><field name="description">Abstract The age of an adult female mosquito is a critical determinant of its ability to transmit a range of human pathogens such as the dengue viruses. Since most pathogens require a relatively long period of development in their mosquito vector before they can be transmitted to a new host, only older insects are of epidemiological importance. It has been proposed that life-shortening strains of the inherited bacterial symbiont Wolbachia may be potentially useful to shift mosquito population age structure towards younger individuals, thereby reducing pathogen transmission without eradicating the mosquito population. However, life-shortening Wolbachia strains do not occur in mosquitoes naturally. To facilitate the evaluation of this potential strategy, the major aim of this project was to transfer a life-shortening Wolbachia strain, wMelPop, from the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to the dengue vector, Aedes aegypti. After successful transinfection, I then characterized the wMelPop infection in this mosquito species, and the associated phenotypic effects of this Wolbachia strain on several aspects of Ae. aegypti life-history. The horizontal transfer of the obligate intracellular bacterium Wolbachia pipientis between invertebrate hosts hinges on the ability of Wolbachia to adapt to new intracellular environments. Previous attempts to directly transfer wMelPop from D. melanogaster to Ae. aegypti have been unsuccessful, presumably due to mal-adaptation of wMelPop to this novel mosquito host. In an attempt to adapt wMelPop to the mosquito intracellular environment to facilitate transfer, we serially passaged this infection for 3 years in Aedes cell culture. After long-term serial passage in mosquito cell lines, wMelPop was then initially reintroduced into its native host, D. melanogaster, by embryonic microinjection to examine the phenotypic outcome of this process. The cell line-adapted wMelPop strains were characterized by a loss of infectivity when reintroduced into Drosophila, grew to decreased densities, and had reduced abilities to cause life-shortening infection and cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), when compared to the original wMelPop strain. These results were suggestive of adaptation of this Wolbachia strain to the mosquito intracellular environment. Subsequently, we successfully established wMelPop in Ae. aegypti using embryonic microinjection. Two independently transinfected Ae. aegypti lines, PGYP1 and PGYP2, were generated. Analogous to infection in Drosophila, the presence of wMelPop in both of these lines halved adult mosquito lifespan under a range of laboratory conditions. The new association is stable, and wMelPop is maternally inherited with high fidelity across Ae. aegypti life span. It is capable of inducing near perfect CI that does not diminish as male Ae. aegypti age, which should facilitate its invasion into natural field populations and persistence over time. Fecundity assays using young PGYP1 females revealed that wMelPop infection induced minimal costs for reproductive fitness for females during their first gonotrophic cycle. The phenotypic effects of wMelPop on several aspects of Ae. aegypti life-history were additionally characterized. Overall, minor costs of wMelPop infection for pre-imaginal survivorship, development and adult size were observed. However, wMelPop infection decreased the viability of quiescent Ae. aegypti eggs over time. Similarly, the reproductive fitness of wMelPop-infected Ae. aegypti females declined with age. These results revealed a general pattern associated with wMelPop pathogenesis in Ae. aegypti, where host fitness costs incurred by this infection increase during aging of both immature and adult life-history stages. We also discovered that wMelPop-infected Ae. aegypti have a reduced ability to utilise blood from non-human hosts for egg development. Blood feeding by wMelPop-infected females on mouse, guinea pig or chicken hosts resulted in a near complete abolishment of reproductive output associated with both a decline in the numbers of eggs oviposited as well as the hatching rate of successfully laid eggs. In contrast, the reproductive output of wMelPop-infected females fed human blood was normal, with intermediate effects observed with other vertebrate blood sources. Removal of Wolbachia from mosquitoes using antibiotic treatment restored egg development to standard levels on all blood sources. Further blood feeding assays over two reproductive cycles definitively illustrated a nutritional interaction between host blood source and egg development in wMelPop-infected Ae. aegypti. This dramatic phenotype may provide new insights into the nutritional basis of mosquito anthropophily. The results presented in this thesis highlight several important parameters required to theoretically model the infection dynamics of wMelPop, and its potential impacts on Ae. aegypti populations. Moreover, the successful establishment of wMelPop in Ae. aegypti forms the primary basis for further field-based evaluations, which will ultimately determine the viability of this Wolbachia-based strategy as an applied tool to reduce dengue transmission.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wolbachia</field><field name="subject">mosquito</field><field name="subject">Aedes aegypti</field><field name="subject">dengue</field><field name="subject">symbiosis</field><field name="subject">Drosophila melanogaster</field><field name="subject">adaptation</field><field name="subject">vector-borne disease</field><field name="subject">disease control</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177990</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of the rumen microbial community degrading the non-protein amino acid ADAB from Acacia angustissima</field><field name="creator">Erin Collins</field><field name="description">The tropical legume Acacia angustissima exhibits remarkable drought tolerance and can thrive in extreme environments. A. angustissima has been proposed as a protein supplement to improve the nutrition of livestock in Africa, South-East Asia and Northern areas of Australia. The widespread implementation of such supplementation practices with A. angustissima have been impeded due to adverse effects of its consumption in animal feed trials. The amino acid content of the plant has been investigated to assess the putative anti-nutritive factors, as a number of non-protein amino acids are known to result in ill effects in livestock. The non-protein amino acid &#947;-acetyl-2, 4-diaminobutyric acid (ADAB) was determined to comprise above 60% of the total amino acid fraction and this equates to between 1.8 and 2.9% dry matter of the plant. In similar cases where anti-nutritive properties of plants have had deleterious effects on livestock, inoculation with and/or transfers of rumen microorganisms have conferred tolerance. Therefore microorganisms with the ability to degrade ADAB were the target of this research. A polyphasic approach combining both culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques was adopted. Initially rumen contents were enriched to select for ADAB degrading microorganisms using the amino acid containing fraction of A. angustissima, and these enrichment cultures provided the basis for investigation into the members of this community responsible for ADAB degradation. A dilution series of an ADAB degrading enrichment culture was carried out in order to provide a source of the enrichment where ADAB degradation was and was not occurring, allowing direct comparison. 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene clone libraries were constructed to compare representatives of the ADAB degrading and ADAB non-degrading enrichment cultures with a view to discern the identity of microorganisms integral to ADAB degradation. A defined group of sequences belonging to the cluster IV of the clostridia within the Firmicutes phylum were found only in the ADAB degrading 16S rRNA gene clone library, and were the target of probe design. The 16S rRNA targeted oligonucleotide probe ADAB1268 was designed to target this group of microorganisms specifically. The ADAB1268 probe was synthesised with a fluorescent label and optimised for use in the fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) procedure. Cells hybridising the ADAB1268 probe were numerically dominant within the ADAB degrading enrichment cultures, adding further weight to the hypothesis that this group of microorganisms were involved in ADAB degradation. Attempts to isolate microorganisms that can degrade ADAB in pure-culture were carried out and the phylogeny of the resulting isolates investigated. One isolate PC13 was found to cluster with the 16S rRNA gene clones from the ADAB degrading library targeted by the ADAB1268 probe. Therefore isolate PC13 was the subject of further research. It was found that isolate PC13 carried out complete degradation of up to 10 mM ADAB in growing culture, deaminating the compound. Isolate PC13 is a rod-shaped microorganism that utilises acetate and produces butyrate. Additional experiments using cell extracts were carried out to examine whether this microorganism degraded a range of other substrates, in an attempt to elucidate the process of ADAB degradation. The isolation and identification of an isolate with the ability to degrade the non-protein amino acid ADAB was a significant finding. Little is known about the degradation of non-protein amino acids by rumen microorganisms, and thus this isolate provides opportunities for further investigation into this process. Attaining this isolate also allows us to explore avenues for manipulation of rumen populations to provide protection against the anti-nutritive property of ADAB.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178000</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creation and Implementation of a Great Ape Welfare Index</field><field name="creator">Amanda Fernie</field><field name="description">This thesis has the overall aims of creating a welfare-sensitive additive index of captive great ape husbandry using the expert opinion of relevant stakeholders, highlighting the aspects of husbandry requiring most improvement and allowing enclosures in different zoos and wildlife parks to be ranked in a uniform way. I investigated the attitudes of experts on the management of captive great apes to gain a greater understanding of the features of their environment that may be critical in maintaining a high standard of welfare. From the experts ranking of the different Levels of facilities offered to the great apes I constructed an additive index with 17 key attributes with between two and four Levels for each. The Great Ape Welfare Index (GAWI) derived from expert opinion has Social structure, Enclosure appearance, Group size, Enclosure furnishings and Avoidance provision as the most important attributes of a management system. The GAWI was then validated by recording the behaviour of the captive great apes housed in Australian and overseas zoos, and comparing their activity budgets to wild individuals. Using a Penrose Distance Statistic a significant negative correlation was found between Index score and the departure from wild activity budgets. Additionally I found a significant negative correlation between the change in the proportion of time spent resting and the welfare Index score achieved indicating that those great apes housed in enclosures achieving higher Index scores are more active in general. Finally the husbandry and management systems for great apes currently used by zoos globally were investigated and their ranking in the Index were calculated. This allowed the particular aspects of great ape management requiring improvement to be identified for each enclosure. Comparisons of regional means showed that Australian zoos achieved significantly higher Index scores than those in other parts of the world. The proportion of great apes housed in New Zealand zoos reported as displaying an abnormal behaviour was significantly higher than all other regions with the proportion of great apes housed in Australia displaying significantly less abnormal behaviour when compared to the US. The highest index achieved by any enclosure was 97.5 for an enclosure that housed a group of gorillas, with the lowest index allocated was 52.2 for an orangutan enclosure. The presence of abnormal behaviours was also investigated with the most common abnormal behaviours reported being regurgitation and re-ingestion (15.8%), hair plucking (10.2%) and begging (7.9%) with some animals reported as exhibiting four different abnormal behaviours. The GAWI has the potential to improve the captive environments provided to great apes through highlighting the most critical aspects of their husbandry requiring improvement. This should encourage zoos to aim higher than just complying with minimum standards set by their regional zoological associations. As the index correlates with the behaviour of the great apes housed, their behaviour may more closely resemble wild individuals if improvements are made. The GAWI has been compared to two alternative models to investigate whether the methods used to create the index could be simplified while still allowing adequate discrimination between enclosures and species. This index can be adapted for use in other institutions housing great apes and can act as a model to create indices for other species. The index has been submitted to the primate Taxon Advisory Group of the Australian Regional Association of Zoological Parks and Aquaria for their consideration of its use in their accreditation scheme or husbandry guidelines.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Great Apes</field><field name="subject">Husbandry</field><field name="subject">Index</field><field name="subject">Welfare</field><field name="subject">Zoo</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178019</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preventing anxiety and promoting social and emotional strength in early childhood: An investigation of aetiological risk factors</field><field name="creator">Kristine Pahl</field><field name="description">Anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents, with ten to fifteen percent of young children experiencing internalising problems (Briggs-Gowan, Carter, Irwin, Wachtel, &amp; Cicchetti, 2004; Egger &amp; Angold, 2006). Researchers have indicated that clinically significant anxiety can exist in preschool aged children and can be sub-typed into patterns similar to that of older children. This early identification of anxiety has lead researchers to recommend that prevention efforts occur early in the life course (Beinvenu &amp; Ginsburg, 2007), before the onset of disorder(s). Research remains scarce as to when the ultimate time to intervene would be, as anxiety research with young children is minimal. The studies presented in this thesis attempt to expand the current literature within in the area of early childhood anxiety. The first objective of this thesis was to extend the literature in the field of early childhood anxiety by examining the aetiology of anxiety and behavioural inhibition (BI) through the investigation of potential risk factors. This study (Study One) represents one of the first investigations within the research to examine risk factors for early childhood anxiety. Two hundred and thirty-six children aged four to six years participated in this study. Parents of the children completed self-report questionnaires at one time point. Results revealed that BI did not significantly predict anxiety, nor did any of the risk factors significantly predict BI. Significant predictors of anxiety included mother&#8217;s negative affect and mother&#8217;s parenting stress. Father&#8217;s parenting stress was found to play a mediating role between mother&#8217;s parenting stress and child anxiety. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of both parents (directly or through mediation) in the aetiology of early childhood anxiety. The findings of Study One provide important information regarding the aetiology of early childhood anxiety and provide important implications for the development of preventative intervention programs. Study Two sought to examine the efficacy of a preventative intervention program (Fun FRIENDS; Barrett, 2007a) for preschool aged children, delivered as a school- based, universal intervention. This was the first study conducted evaluating the Fun FRIENDS program and was one of only a few prevention trials cited within the literature examining early childhood anxiety. The study involved a cohort of 263 children enrolled in one of 16 preschool classes. Children were aged between four and six years. Schools were randomly allocated to either an intervention group (IG) or a waitlist control group (WLG). Parents of the children and teachers completed self-report questionnaires at preintervention, postintervention, and at 12-month follow-up (parents in the IG only). Parent report data revealed no significant differences between intervention conditions on anxiety at postintervention, although participants in the IG experienced larger reductions in anxiety than participants in the WLG. Children in both conditions decreased in BI symptoms at postintervention, except for boys in the IG. Significant increases in social-emotional strength were found for girls in both conditions, but not for boys. When examining the IG only over the long-term (pre, post, 12 month follow-up), nearly significant decreases in anxiety were found at postintervention and significant decreases were found again at 12-month follow-up. Improvements in BI were found at all time points for girls but not for boys and improvements on social-emotional strength were found from preintervention to 12-month follow-up, with girls scoring significantly higher than boys. For teacher report, children in the IG improved significantly more on BI compared to the WLG at postintervention indicating that the intervention program may have had a positive impact on these children in learning strategies to manage BI symptoms. However, at pr-intervention, scores on BI were significantly different between the IG and the WLG. Similar to parent report, girls in the IG experienced the largest decrease in BI symptoms at postintervention. On social-emotional strength, children in the IG improved significantly more than children in the WLG at postintervention with girls in the IG experiencing the largest improvement from pre to postintervention. Overall, these findings suggest that the intervention program had a positive impact on some children as evidenced by improvements in anxiety, BI, and social-emotional strength at postintervention and at 12-month follow-up. Parent report indicated that children in the WLG also improved on these measures, making it difficult to contribute positive changes solely to the program. However, teacher report did indicate that children in the IG improved significantly more than children in the WLG. The improvements gained at 12-month follow-up highlight the potential long-term impact of the program although, without a comparison group, it is unknown whether significant differences would exist between both conditions. Implications of these results are discussed along with limitations and directions for future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">anxiety, prevention, social-emotional competence, resilience, universal prevention, risk factors, protective factors</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178027</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behavioural Inhibition in Children with ADHD: Does Stimulant Medication Eliminate Potential Deficits?</field><field name="creator">Caroline Johnson</field><field name="description">Attention-Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is characterized by higher than normal levels of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. Behavioural inhibition is proposed to be a primary deficit in children with ADHD, and is included as a component of a number of models accounting for the core behavioural symptoms of ADHD. Children with ADHD often show deficits in their performance on behavioural inhibition tasks relative to typically developing children of the same age, although inconsistent findings have been observed. Stimulant medication is associated with reduction in the core symptoms of ADHD in the majority of children. The primary goal of this thesis was to examine the effects of stimulant medication on behavioural inhibition in children with ADHD. Furthermore, this thesis sought to determine whether children with ADHD who have, and have not taken stimulant medication differ from normally developing children in terms of behavioural inhibition. In order to achieve these aims, it was necessary to firstly determine which tasks provide the best measures of behavioural inhibition. While many tasks have been used to measure inhibitory control amongst children with ADHD, it was unclear from previous research which tasks measure the same constructs. Study 1 investigated relationships in task performance among seven measures of inhibitory control, including the Stop-Signal task, Go / No-go task, Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART; analogous the not-X Continuous Performance Task), Eriksen Flanker task, Stroop, Opposite Worlds task and Task-Switching task. Significant developmental changes in a variety of cognitive abilities occur across childhood and adolescence. To limit the possibility that developmental changes in task performance would be observed, the age range for children included in the study was restricted to seven to 10 years. Nevertheless, to interpret correlations among inhibition measures from the tasks, it was necessary to determine whether children showed comparable developmental trends in their performance across tasks. Study 1A investigated developmental changes in the performances of the seven tasks purported to measure inhibitory control in normally developing children aged seven to 10 years. The results of this study suggested that the tasks chosen were appropriate for use among this age group, and that there is little change in behavioural inhibition across the seven to 10 years age range. In Study 1B, inhibition measures from each of the tasks were included in an exploratory factor analysis to determine those tasks measuring the same constructs. The results of Study 1B suggested that the Stop-Signal, Go / No-go and SART tasks provided the best measures of the behavioural inhibition construct. Performance on the Eriksen Flanker task was also related to the performance on these tasks, but in a direction contrary to that predicted. The Stroop and Opposite Worlds tasks measured the same construct, which appeared to be interference control. Performance on the Task-Switching task was not related to the performance on any other task, suggesting that this task did not measure behavioural inhibition or interference control. Study 2 investigated the performance of children with ADHD on the three tasks shown to be the best measures of behavioural inhibition in Study 1B (i.e., the Stop-Signal task, Go / No-go task and Sustained Attention to Response task). Children with ADHD were aged from seven to 11 years, and were tested both when they had, and had not taken their regularly prescribed stimulant medication. The performance of children with ADHD on these tasks was compared to that of normally developing children matched in age. The results of Study 2 suggested that stimulant medication leads to significant improvement in behavioral inhibition amongst children with ADHD, such that children with ADHD do not differ from matched controls. However, this effect was not observed across all three tasks.

Dwarfing genes in sorghum have not been accompanied by such increases in grain production. On the contrary, some of the commercially employed dwarfing genes in sorghum have been associated with negative effects on grain yield. A positive correlation between plant height and grain yield was also observed in trial data for a diverse range of hybrids tested within the Queensland Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries Sorghum Breeding Program in north-eastern Australia. No attempts have previously been made to examine the physiological basis of the relationship between plant height and grain yield in sorghum. The dwarfing genes that are commercially used in wheat, Rht-B1 and Rht-D1 (formerly known as Rht1 and Rht2, respectively), on the other hand, have been studied extensively. They have been shown to have substantial and positive effects on grain number and harvest index, while not considerably reducing plant biomass, increasing grain yield. Our objective in this study was to examine the effect of height on the physiological and genetic determinants of growth and yield in sorghum to determine whether there was scope to improve yield by increasing the height of sorghum. A positive correlation between plant height and yield was observed in a population that was fixed for the major dwarfing genes, but showed variation in peduncle and panicle length, which are under control of minor dwarfing genes. To study the effects of a single major dwarfing gene (dw3) on biomass production and grain yield, 2- and 3-dwarf isogenic contrasts were developed in three different genetic backgrounds (R931945-2-2, R955343-1, R955637). In some cases, dw3 led to a significant reduction in plant biomass, which was not sufficiently offset by increase in harvest index to avoid yield reduction. This is contrary to the situation in wheat. The observed reductions in plant biomass in sorghum were associated with reduced tiller number and a reduction in radiation use efficiency (RUE) in the short types. Subsequent experiments suggested that an increase in allocation of biomass to the roots, rather than differences in photosynthetic capacity or respiration, was the main cause for the apparent reduction in RUE. However, due to plant-to-plant variability and the difficulty in accurately measuring root-total biomass ratio, studies with greater replication are required to confirm this hypothesis. It was also found that interactions with genetic background (and environment) moderated the effects of dw3, resulting in smaller height, biomass and grain yield reductions in some isogenic pairs. The effects of dwarfing genes on grain yield therefore need to be assessed separately for different genetic backgrounds. As lodging may be controlled by means other than height reduction (e.g. stay-green), we suggest that yield of standard sorghum types used in industrialised countries may benefit from moderate increases in plant height.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sorghum bicolor, dwarfing genes, yield, radiation use efficiency, respiration, photosynthesis.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178056</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the lifelong learner qualities of post-diploma learners pursuing a degree</field><field name="creator">Yuen Lie Lim</field><field name="description">Rapid technological advances and globalization have resulted in the rise of the information era and with it, the emergence of knowledge economies and the call to lifelong learning viewed as necessary for producing skilled workers. This study examines the characteristics of lifelong learners in different environments, in order to understand how education contributes to the development of the lifelong learner, as well as how active pedagogical approaches, namely problem-based learning, may be especially beneficial for developing the lifelong learner. Using a mixed-methods research approach, this exploratory study was conducted on a sample of polytechnic graduates from Singapore who were continuing their learning in bachelor degree programs at different universities. It was guided by a framework of four main attributes which were identified as possible descriptors of the lifelong learner: capacity for self-directed learning, motivation, metacognitive awareness, and learner disposition. Quantitative data were collected via responses to an instrument, the Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS), while quantitative data were collected through interviews, to capture in-depth information about individuals&#8217; lifelong learner attributes as well as to probe into their experiences in Singapore&#8217;s formal education system that enabled (or hindered) their lifelong learner development. The data generated from the survey and interviews indicated that this group of young learners from Singapore who were continuing their learning journey did manifest some of the qualities of effective lifelong learners. However, there was also some suggestion that their engagement in lifelong learning was not so much from an intrinsic love for learning, but more out of compulsion because of the better job prospects that came with it. Also, despite the aim of the Singapore Ministry of Education to develop lifelong learners under the policy umbrella of Teaching Schools, Learning Nation (TSLN), learners&#8217; experiences suggest that reforms have not reached all secondary schools to the same extent, and that many government schools were still using more didactic teaching rather than learner-centred pedagogies. Cross-case analyses found that the experience of problem-based learning seemed to equip learners with more self-direction in learning, more intrinsic motivation to learn, and a greater metacognitive awareness. At the same time, the positive outcomes of this pedagogy appear to be mediated by the learner&#8217;s own readiness for self-directed learning: learners with lower readiness for self-directed learning appeared to be less able to enjoy the learning benefits of problem-based learning. The study concluded with implications of these findings for the Singapore education system, as well as on problem-based learning as a pedagogy for developing lifelong learners.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lifelong learning</field><field name="subject">problem-based learn</field><field name="subject">Educational Policy</field><field name="subject">knowledge economy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178057</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification and Characterisation of Novel Autotransporters of Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7</field><field name="creator">Timothy Wells</field><field name="description">Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) are a subgroup of Shiga toxin producing E. coli that cause gastrointestinal disease with the potential for life-threatening sequelae. Cattle serve as the natural reservoir for EHEC and outbreaks occur sporadically as a result of contaminated beef products and other farming products. E. coli O157:H7 was the first EHEC strain described and has been responsible for hundreds of outbreaks in Canada, Europe, Japan and the U.S.A. since 1982. While certain EHEC virulence mechanisms have been extensively studied, the factors that mediate host colonisation are poorly defined. Autotransporter (AT) proteins have been identified in many Gram-negative pathogens and are unique in that their primary sequence is sufficient to direct their transport across the bacterial membrane system. Many characterised members are associated with virulence. Using conserved AT motifs as a search tool five putative AT proteins were identified in the EHEC O157:H7 EDL933 genome. The genes encoding these proteins (z0402/ehaA, z0469/ehaB, z3487/ehaC, z3948/ehaD and z5029/ehaG) were PCR amplified, cloned and expressed in an E. coli K-12 MG1655flu background. Characterisation revealed that ehaA, ehaB, ehaD and ehaG encode proteins associated with an increase in biofilm formation. EhaA, EhaB and EhaG were found to mediate biofilm formation under continuous flow conditions when expressed in E. coli K-12. Over-expression of either EhaA or EhaG in E. coli K-12 resulted in the formation of large cell aggregates. Three of the AT proteins were found to mediate adhesion when over-expressed in E. coli K-12. The EhaA AT protein mediated binding to primary epithelial cells of the bovine terminal rectum. EhaB promoted adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins laminin and collagen I and was recognised by IgA serum taken from calves challenged with E. coli O157:H7. EhaG is a member of the trimeric autotransporter adhesin (TAA) sub-group of AT proteins and mediated adhesion to colorectal adenocacinoma (Caco-2) epithelial cells. Our results suggest that EhaA, EhaB, EhaD and EhaG may contribute to adhesion, colonisation and biofilm formation by E. coli O157:H7. This study also used a bioinformatic approach to identify AT encoding genes in available E. coli genomes. We identified 156 AT encoding genes in 18 E. coli genomes queried. Alignment and analysis of these proteins identified three broad groups, the serine protease autotransporters of enterobacteriacae (SPATEs), the trimeric autotransporter adhesins (TAAs) and AIDA-I type AT vii proteins. The latter group consisted of a further ten sub-groups. The results demonstrated that E. coli strains encode multiple AT proteins, many of which may have some degree of functional redundancy.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">O157 : H7</field><field name="subject">Autotransporter</field><field name="subject">EHEC</field><field name="subject">Biofilm</field><field name="subject">Adhesion</field><field name="subject">Adhesin</field><field name="subject">Aggregation</field><field name="subject">Escherichia coli (E. coli)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178070</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metallurgical Influences on the Stress Corrosion Cracking of Rock Bolts</field><field name="creator">Ernesto Villalba</field><field name="description">The influence of steel metallurgy on rock bolt SCC was studied using a series of commercial carbon and low-alloyed steels. The chemical composition, their mechanical properties and the microstructures of these steels varied considerably in order to gather information for the discussion of the metallurgical influences under Hydrogen Embrittlement (HE) and Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) conditions. In order to understand the metallurgical influences on Rock Bolt SCC, an evaluation was carried out to fifteen commercial steels. The experiments reproduced the Stress Corrosion Cracking condition at which commercial rock bolts had failed in Australians mines. Due to the selected materials, stress and electrolyte condition it is expected that Hydrogen Embrittlement (HE) will affect the steel failure. The approach was to use the Linearly Increasing Stress Test (LIST) and exposing the sample to a dilute pH 2.1-sulphate solution, in accordance with prior studies. Stress Corrosion Cracking was evaluated by analysing the decrease in tensile strength, loss of ductility and fractography observed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The initial series of test to the fifteen steels were performed at the free corrosion potential (f.c.p.) vs. Ag/AgCl. From this initial test only five steels (AISI 1008, AISI 4140, AISI 4145H, pipeline X-65 and X-70) did not show Stress Corrosion Cracking features. These five steel were tested in accordance with the Linearly Increased Stress Test (LIST) in the dilute pH 2.1 sulphate solution at different electronegative applied potential to minimum value of -1500mV. The experimental procedure tried to reproduce the Stress Corrosion Cracking condition to identify the most aggressive condition the steel is able to support before failing due to Stress Corrosion Cracking to then compare the theory of SCC and HE in low carbon and low alloy steel with the obtained experimental results. The investigation compared the well-known theory of SCC and HE in low carbon and low alloy steel with the obtained experimental results. Surprisingly, the experimental result did not always agree with the theory.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stress Corrosion Cracking</field><field name="subject">rock bolt</field><field name="subject">Hydrogen Embrittlement</field><field name="subject">High strength steel</field><field name="subject">LIST</field><field name="subject">scanning electron microscopy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178116</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rejection Sensitivity, Information Processing Deficits, Attachment Style and Empathic Accuracy in Violent Relationships</field><field name="creator">Laurance Robillard</field><field name="description">Relationship violence is a serious social problem. Given the prevalence and detrimental effects of relationship violence, much research has been undertaken to investigate the various risk factors that may be associated with this type of violence. In the present research, I examined the interrelationships among several correlates of violence (including rejection sensitivity, cognitive biases, decoding deficits and attachment style) in order to understand what differentiates physically abusive from non-abusive individuals. Hence, the current program of studies examined aggressive behaviours between partners with a focus on risk factors for violent behaviour in men and women and in particular on the role of rejection sensitivity in physically aggressive behaviour. In order to examine these constructs, the thesis includes six chapters. Following a review of the literature, a rationale was provided for the creation of an amended measure of rejection sensitivity as Downey and Feldman&#8217;s (1996) Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire was not suitable for the purposes of the current thesis. Hence, a series of validation studies were conducted in Chapter 2 to test and develop a revised measure of rejection sensitivity that would be applicable to a wider range of intimate relationships (dating, cohabiting and married) and contexts. The study reported in Chapter 3, investigated the role of rejection sensitivity, hostile attributions and attachment patterns in the etiology of intimate partner violence. This study provided preliminary support for insecure attachment and negative attributions as the link between expectations of rejection and intimate partner violence, with a stronger link for male-perpetrated violence compared to female-perpetrated violence. Consistent with the marital violence literature, when mediator and moderator relationships existed, these occurred predominantly in married relationships (as opposed to dating or defacto relationships). The studies reported in Chapters 4 and 5 built on the foundations of Chapter 3 by incorporating two constructs, the &#8216;overattribution bias&#8217; and empathic accuracy into the investigation of the associations between rejection sensitivity and violence. Specifically, the study reported in Chapter 4 examined the decoding deficits and inferential biases of maritally-violent and maritally-violent rejection-sensitive men when interpreting their own partner&#8217;s messages whilst engaging in a laboratory-based decoding task. Overall, results showed that maritally-violent partner rejection-sensitive men were less accurate than were maritally non-violent partner rejection-sensitive men when interpreting their wives&#8217; positive messages and more accurate when interpreting their wives&#8217; negative messages. Likewise, maritally-violent rejection-sensitive men displayed an inferential bias to perceive their wives&#8217; messages as being more negative, critical and rejecting in intent than did maritally non-violent rejection-sensitive men. In addition, maritally-violent men as a group were less accurate for their own partner&#8217;s positive and neutral messages than were maritally non-violent men and more accurate for their own wives&#8217; negative messages than were maritally non-violent men. Finally, maritally-violent men tended to attribute their wives&#8217; messages as being significantly more negative, critical and rejecting in intent than did maritally non-violent men. Overall, the data suggested that both rejection sensitivity and marital violence were key factors that were associated with married men&#8217;s decoding problems and biased interpretation of their own wives&#8217; messages. In extending the previous findings, the study reported in Chapter 5 examined the decoding accuracy and inferential biases of both maritally-violent and maritally-violent rejection-sensitive men and women in relation to female strangers&#8217; messages. There were no differences between maritally-violent rejection-sensitive women and maritally non-violent rejection-sensitive women on decoding deficits and inferential biases for female strangers. However, there was a trend for maritally-violent women to be more negatively biased than were maritally non-violent women when interpreting female strangers&#8217; messages. Additionally, in contrast to the findings of Chapter 4, the data pointed to independent relationships among rejection sensitivity, violence and married men&#8217;s decoding deficits and biases for female strangers&#8217; messages. In particular, there were no differences in decoding deficits or inferential biases between maritally violent rejection-sensitive and maritally non-violent rejection-sensitive men when decoding female strangers&#8217; messages. Instead, the data revealed that maritally-violent men were poor decoders of female strangers&#8217; positive messages compared to maritally non-violent men and maritally-violent women. In relation to negative messages, maritally-violent men were more accurate for female strangers&#8217; negative messages than were maritally non-violent men. Maritally violent men had the highest decoding accuracy for negative messages. Maritally-violent men also tended to attribute female strangers&#8217; messages as being significantly more negative, critical and rejecting in intent than did maritally non-violent men and maritally-violent women. Finally, the results showed that maritally-violent rejection-sensitive men&#8217;s decoding deficits and biases were relationship specific whereas maritally-violent men&#8217;s decoding deficits and cognitive biases were global deficits that extended to women other than the men&#8217;s wives. Implications of the findings were discussed, as well as the strengths and limitations of the study.

Providing shelter, food, monetary value, and a vast resource of ecological wealth, the corals of the reefs underpin an entire ecosystem. Climate change, driven by increased greenhouse gases, is raising the temperature of Earth&#8217;s waters and atmosphere, while making the planet&#8217;s oceans increasingly acidic. Brightly lit and increasingly warm tropical waters present a potentially challenging environment in which scleractinian corals grow. In attempting to cope with the competing stresses of intense photon flux density (PFD) and anomalously high sea surface temperatures, corals and dinoflagellates exhibit myriad biochemical and physiological adaptations. Pocilloporins, a diverse group of non-fluorescent green fluorescent protein (GFP) homologs found across Cnidaria and beyond, are one such adaptation within the tissues of heavily pigmented scleractinian corals. Chemically unique amongst pigments, GFP-like pigments exist as pure protein chromophores and exhibit little to no cytotoxicity when naturally occurring. This non-fluorescent class of GFP-like pigments has found popularity in biochemical and biotechnological applications, though an ecological and evolutionary explanation for the heavy conservation of pocilloporins across a broad range of scleractinian corals and related cnidaria is still a subject of scientific research and debate. This thesis supports the hypothesis that pocilloporins act as a naturally occurring photoprotective pigment in reef-building corals, specifically acting to filter and regulate the light environment within coral polyps. In examining the role of pocilloporins in Scleractinia, the need to examine environmental sources of pigment production induction and suppression, the localization of pigments within coral tissues and cells, and the ability of coral colonies to direct resource allocation with regards to pocilloporin production were identified as lines of inquiry. Briefly, for experiments examining either pocilloporin induction or suppression, the following aspects were studied: holobiont responses in the form of mRNA signal expression, host pigment isolation and analysis, dinoflagellate density and pigmentation sampling, and chlorophyll fluorescence of live corals. Blue morph Acropora aspera, common to the reef flat of Heron Island (Great Barrier Reef, Australia), were subjected to 99% shade and thermal bleaching threshold temperatures in separate attempts to suppress pocilloporin expression, while red morph Montipora monasteriata was transplanted at equivalent depth from their natural cave environments to exposed portions of the spur and groove formations of the northern face of Wistari Reef (Great Barrier Reef, Australia). Both ambient temperature and heat-stressed A. aspera were concurrently collected during the thermal stress experiment and placed in preservatives for immuno-histochemical localization of pocilloporins with their tissues. Finally, radio-labelled glycine, a very common amino acid in the primary sequence of pocilloporin, was injected into artificially injured tan morph Montipora monasteriata, also on the northern face of Wistrai Reef to study the uptake of dissolved organic materials (DOM) and incorporation of metabolic resources into newly generated pigments. Pocilloporins proved easier to induce in this work than suppress, and the location of these pigments in A. aspera tissues suggests a potential mechanism. The data demonstrated the presence of pocilloporins in the most directly exposed epidermal and gastrodermal tissues of the coral polyp, specifically the outermost layers of epidermis and gastrodermal layers bordering directly upon the gastrovascular cavity. Closer inspection through anti-pocilloporin-gold stained TEM images was highly suggestive of pocilloporin secretion in coral mucus, a theory separately supported by observations of coral mucus in collected live corals. Neither suppression experiment induced heavy mucus sloughing in A. aspera, so despite multi-fold reductions in pocilloporin mRNA as a result of applied stimuli, the continued presence of pocilloporin aaCP592 in blue morph A. aspera is not surprising. Conversely, pocilloporin msCP576 in plating Montipora monasteriata was induced in response to both general increases in PFD and specific increases of PFD at the sites of physical injury. Additionally, tan morph Montipora monasteriata demonstrated the capacity to collect and allocate DOM from the environment to assist in the production of new pigments and tissues, an energetically expensive process. The reduction of the orange-red spectrum in favour of the blue light ranges is generally beneficial to the photosynthetic systems of both higher plants and the resident dinoflagellates of corals. msCP576 and aa592, both positively identified as pocilloporins within this work, absorb within the orange-red region and apparently act as a photoprotective filter in all exposed surfaces of heavily pigmented corals, enhancing the blue spectrum of incident and reflected PFD and generally regulating the internal light environment.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Green Fluorescent Proteins</field><field name="subject">Pocilloporin</field><field name="subject">Reef Coral</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Instrumentation and Monitoring of a Large-Scale, Potentially Contaminating Trial Waste Rock Dump</field><field name="creator">Timothy Rohde</field><field name="description">Between 2004 and early 2006 a large-scale, instrumented, potentially contaminating trial waste rock dump was constructed and monitored at Cadia Hill Mine, in NSW, Australia. The trial waste rock dump was instrumented with lysimeters to measure rainfall infiltration and seepage through its base, and temperature sensors and gas sampling tubes to evaluate oxidation of the waste rock, together with three instrumented trial store and release covers on the surface. This thesis describes the construction and instrumentation of the trial waste rock dump and the monitoring results obtained to date, and applies unsaturated soil mechanics principles to understanding the early performance and predicting the future performance of the trial waste rock dump and trial store and release covers. For a given rainfall regime, the rate and quantity of rainfall infiltration into a waste rock dump of a given height, the wetting up of the dump over time, and the occurrence of base seepage will largely be dictated by the particle size distribution of the waste rock delivered to the dump, and the stratigraphy of the dump. The particle size distribution of the waste rock delivered to the dump will depend on the fragmentation of the rock due to blasting and the degree of weathering and hence breakdown on handling of the rock. A waste rock dump constructed by conventional loose end-dumping from haul trucks from a tip-head, as was the case for the trial waste rock dump, consists of a trafficked surface layer extending to a depth of approximately 1 m, underlain by discontinuous alternating coarse and fine-grained layers raveling at the angle of repose of the waste rock, with a base rubble zone of boulders which ravel to the toe of the dump on end-dumping. Trafficking of the surface of the dump by dozers and haul trucks leads to the breaking down, burial and side-casting of the rock to form a well-graded material typically finer than 100 mm in particle size, with a moderate to high water storage capacity. The underlying coarse-grained angle of repose layers serve as air pathways during dry conditions and preferred seepage pathways during and following periods of heavy rainfall resulting in base seepage. The fine-grained angle of repose layers have a moderate to high water storage capacity and largely retain water in storage rather than generating base seepage. The base rubble zone may contain boulders up to 1 m in size, depending on the fragmentation of the rock due to blasting and the degree of weathering and hence breakdown on handling of the rock. It serves largely as a pathway for air during dry conditions, while passing base seepage during and following periods of heavy rainfall. As the dump wets up, partially saturated &#8220;fingers&#8221; develop and extend into the dump. Partially saturated fine-grained layers, having a medium to high water storage capacity, largely retain their partial saturation, while coarse-grained layers drain resulting, in base seepage. Plugs of water temporarily stored within the dump drain down through the dump, so that the base seepage that emerges is &#8220;old&#8221; water, not the rainfall infiltration (&#8220;new&#8221; water) that generated it. The size of the rainfall event required to generate base seepage will decrease as the dump wets up and the partially saturated fingers extend closer to the base of the dump. The residence time of water within the dump that passes along preferred seepage pathways will be relatively short and will become shorter as the dump wets up, while the residence time of water stored within the fine-grained layers will be very long, and possibly indefinite in a dry climate. The ingress of air through the base rubble zone, up the coarse-grained angle of repose layers, through the sides of the dump, and to a lesser extent through the trafficked layer, by the processes of convection, advection and diffusion, respectively, results in the exposure of reactive waste rock to oxidation. The fine-grained reactive waste rock, presenting a far greater surface area per unit volume than the coarse-grained waste rock, and typically having a greater proportion of fresh surfaces, is by far the most reactive. The ingress of air into the fine-grained layers is largely by diffusion from the adjacent coarse-grained layers. The transport of oxidation products from the dump largely occurs during and following periods of heavy rainfall, when preferred pathway flow is mobilised and base seepage occurs. The main exposure to preferred pathway flow is along these pathways, where the surface area per unit volume and hence the proportion of oxidation products are low, with much of the oxidation products formed on the fine-grained particles retained within the dump along with stored water. Due to the discontinuous stratigraphy of a waste rock dump, the preferential pathways for flow are randomly located within the dump. In addition, preferential pathways evolve over time as the waste rock weathers, settles, and as fines are transported with the flow. The trafficked surface of the dump also evolves over time, becoming more heterogeneous as the surface settles differentially, generating internal rainfall runoff and the transport of fines, and the development of &#8220;sinkholes&#8221; for the preferred entry of ponded rainfall. The principle purpose of cover systems over waste rock dumps is to restrict net percolation into the dump, so that percolation through the reactive waste rock is minimal in the longer term. The approach used to design any cover system is dominated by climate. Semi-arid environments are conducive to store and release cover systems which take advantage of well-graded oxide materials to provide high storage capacities, low percolation and stability. Three trial store and release covers, each comprising a sealing layer overlain by a thick mounded rocky soil mulch layer, were installed at Cadia Hill Mine in 2005-2006 to assess their feasibility to limit net percolation under the climatic conditions encountered at Cadia. This research described in this thesis has demonstrated a number of key issues that should be considered in the management and closure of waste rock dumps: &#8226; the initial moisture condition of the end-dumped waste rock will effect its early ability to store incidental rainfall; &#8226; the available water storage capacity of the waste rock will affect the size of the triggering rainfall event and the base seepage response time, with the storage capacity being taken up as the dump wets up, reducing both the size of the triggering rainfall event and the response time; &#8226; iterative modelling and calculations using HYDRUS-2D suggest that the trial waste rock dump will take between 3 years and 6 years to become sufficiently saturated that it will pass any rainfall infiltration, depending on the extent to which the waste rock weathers over time; and &#8226; all three trial store and release covers have demonstrated good performance over the monitoring period, and this has been verified using HYDRUS-2D, , with any net percolation being the result of an initial high placement moisture content of the cover materials.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cover design</field><field name="subject">Landform design</field><field name="subject">infiltration</field><field name="subject">seepage</field><field name="subject">acid rock drainage</field><field name="subject">unsaturated soil mechanics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178416</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Arriving at a New Beginning: Redefining Socratic Pedagogy</field><field name="creator">Sarah Davey</field><field name="description">The Socratic Method has been an educational tool ever since Socrates himself turned the marketplace of Athens into a classroom, enticing his interlocutors into dialogue whereby they could have their assumptions questioned and learn to journey towards new conceptions of knowledge and understanding. This concept has been reflected recently in a current proposal by UNESCO for educators and philosophers to find ways in which philosophy and philosophical inquiry may be approached in current education practices to enhance democratic ways of life. I draw on the UNESCO idea of philosophy as a &#8216;school of freedom&#8217; and contend that not only is dialogical inquiry useful to teaching and learning, but that it is necessary. Inquiry is viewed in this way as necessarily dialogical and I draw on both Charles Peirce&#8217;s and John Dewey&#8217;s views on inquiry as being situated within the community if it is to satisfy some of the aims of the UNESCO report. This dissertation proposes a framework for Socratic pedagogy, a collaborative inquiry-based approach to teaching and learning suitable not only for formal educational settings such as the school classroom but for all educational settings. The term is intended to capture a variety of philosophical approaches to classroom practice that could broadly be described as Socratic in form. I explore three models that, I argue, make a significant contribution to Socratic pedagogy: Matthew Lipman&#8217;s Community of Inquiry, Leonard Nelson&#8217;s Socratic Dialogue, and David Bohm&#8217;s Dialogue. I also draw on the metaphors used by each of the proponents because they give an additional insight into the theoretical underpinnings of their models of dialogue for the development of Socratic thinking. Socratic pedagogy is multi-dimensional, which I argue is underpinned by generative, evaluative, and connective thinking. These terms are better placed to describe Socratic pedagogy than creative, critical, and caring thinking, because they are defined by the function they perform. It is hoped that this dissertation offers some way to show how philosophy as inquiry can contribute to educational theory and practice, while also demonstrating how it can be an effective way to approach teaching and learning.

Spores and pollen grains are also recorded, but these are, with some exceptions, subordinate to the dinoflagellate components.In the systematic section, one new dinoflagellate cyst genus, Kipatimudinium, is formally described and nine new species are established: Amphorulla ruvuense, Dichadogonyaulax mandawaense, Egmontodinium annaiae, Hystrichodinium playfordii, Kipatimudinium foliatum (type species), Limbodinium patulum, Pseudoceratium redactum, Sentusidinium tanzaniensis, and Yalkalpodinium africanum.&#160;Six, informal, stratigraphically successive dinoflagellate assemblages are distinguished:Assemblage I (Bajocian-Bathonian); Assemblage II (Callovian); Assemblage III (Oxfordian); Assemblage IV (Kimmeridgian-Tithonian); Assemblage V (Berriasian-Barremian); and Assemblage VI (Aptian-Cenomanian).Coastal Tanzania appears referable to the Austral dinoflagellate realm due to the presence of, inter alia, Broomea ramosa, Komewuia glabra, Wanaea clathrata, and Wanaea digitata. Some minor biostratigraphic anomalies are noted, including the introduction of Glossodinium dimorphum; this is datable as early Oxfordian in Tanzania whereas in Australasia the species appears earlier (in the Callovian). A few noteworthy quantitative phenomena are evident; for instance, the abundance of Lithodinia jurassica in the vicinity of the Callovian-Oxfordian boundary and the marked increase of Wanaea spp. in the Oxfordian, specifically in the Ruvu Basin of the northern coastal belt. These events are of chronostratigraphic significance and could be applicable to regional correlation. Middle-Late Jurassic assemblages show a conspicuous degree of cosmopolitanism, and include some species previously considered to be restricted to certain regions in the low and high latitudes.The Early Cretaceous (Berriasian-Barremian) assemblages show close affinity to the Tethyan Realm. The latest Early Cretaceous (Albian) to earliest Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian) strata are allied to the Albian-Cenomanian Elaterates province. The presence of elater-bearing pollen in offshore and onshore sections of Tanzania indicates that the elaterates had a wider geographic distribution than previously reported: i.e., extending beyond the northern part of the African and South American continents.The lower part of the Kipatimu Formation, which contains Assemblage IV, yielded Komewuia glabra, Broomea ramosa, and Rigaudella aemula and their presence precludes the Early Cretaceous age previously ascribed to this part of the formation. Likewise the Makonde and Mkindani Beds have yielded typically Early Cretaceous pollen grains including Classopollis braziliensis, Retitricolpites vulgaris, and Elaterocolpites castelainii.The Jurassic/Cretaceous boundary is coincident with the upper limit of Assemblage IV based on the last appearances of, in particular, Komewuia glabra and Rigaudella aemula. Within the Kipatimu Formation (as represented in wells SS-5 and SS-7), the systemic boundary appears conformable. But elsewhere in the coastal belt, the boundary is clearly unconformable.On the basis of palynostratigraphic data, significant biostratigraphic events, such as introductions and exits of certain dinoflagellate species often match sequence boundaries.From palynofacies analyses and palynostratigraphic data the Kipatimu Formation is dominated by phytoclasts indicating high terrestrial inputs during its deposition. Abundance of black wood (of high buoyancy) in the majority of samples implies high energy settings and abundance of brown wood (less buoyant) is an indication of a sudden terrestrial input into the marine system.&#160;The organic composition of sedimentary rocks is an important means of which the depositional history of the enclosing sediments can be understood. Different environmental settings clearly influence the character of palynofacies. For example, abundant chorate cysts (e.g., Systematophora spp.) in samples from the upper sections of SS-5 suggest open marine settings. Therefore, palynofacies analyses can be viewed as providing useful pointers to interpreting the environmental circumstances in which the rocks, in this case the Kipatimu Formation, were deposited.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260000 Earth Sciences</field><field name="subject">Key words: Coastal Tanzania, palynology, systematics, Middle Jurassic, Cretaceous, biostratigraphy, palynofacies</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178439</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on phosphine toxicity and resistance mechanisms in Caenorhabditis elegans</field><field name="creator">Qiang Cheng</field><field name="description">Phosphine, hydrogen phosphide (PH3), gas is a fumigant that is used worldwide to protect stored grain from infestation by insect pests. Despite a long history of phosphine use, little is known about either the mode of action of this compound or the mechanisms whereby insect pests have become resistant. To better understand phosphine toxicity and resistance mechanisms, a genetically well-characterised model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans, was used in my PhD project. Three previously created phosphine resistant C. elegans mutants (pre-1, pre-7 and pre-33) developed from the wild type N2 strain were used in this study, though analysis of pre-33 was the primary focus. The three mutants were determined to be 2, 5 and 9 times more resistant toward phosphine than was the parental N2 strain by comparison of LC50 values. Molecular oxygen was shown to be an extremely effective synergist with phosphine as, under hyperoxic conditions, 100% mortality was observed in wild-type nematodes exposed to 0.1 mg/l phosphine, a non-lethal concentration in air. All three mutants were resistant to the synergistic effects of oxygen in proportion to their resistance to phosphine with one mutant, pre-33, showing complete resistance to this synergism. I take the proportionality of cross-resistance between phosphine and the synergistic effect of oxygen to imply that all three mutants circumvent a mechanism of phosphine toxicity that is directly coupled to oxygen metabolism. Compared with the wild-type strain, each of the three mutants has an extended average life expectancy of 12.5 to 25.3%. This is consistent with the proposed involvement of oxidative stress in both phosphine toxicity and ageing. Indeed, a correlation between phosphine resistance and resistance to other stressors (e.g. heavy metal, heat and UV) was also detected. On the other hand, no significant difference in methyl viologen sensitivity was found between pre-33 and N2 strains, suggesting that pre-33 mutant does not seem to provide resistance to phosphine via protection against oxidative damage. Additionally, to test for possible involvement of the DAF-2/DAF-16 signalling pathway in the phosphine response, the levels of phosphine sensitivity of mutants in this pathway were tested. Phosphine resistance levels were increased in daf-2 and age-1 mutants but decreased in daf-16 nematodes, which mirrors the longevity phenotypes of these mutants, suggesting some congruence in glucose signalling between the phosphine resistance and longevity traits. In contrast, no congruence is observed between phosphine resistance and oxidative metabolism as the clk-mutation, which disrupts oxidative metabolism does not cause phosphine resistance and neither do the phosphine resistant mutants cause the severe developmental delay of the clk-1 mutation. The phosphine induced time-dependent mortality was assessed in both N2 and pre-33 nematodes at two fixed phosphine concentrations (0.3 and 3.0 mg/l), allowing the determination of minimum exposure periods required for any mortality as well as the exposure time required to achieve 50% mortality. As a result, it was determined that 15 hours of exposure was needed for significant mortality in N2 and pre-33 strain when exposed to 0.3 and 3.0 mg/l of phosphine, respectively; whereas this period is 5 hours for N2 when treated with 3.0 mg/l phosphine. The fact that the LT50 value for N2 at 0.3 mg/l phosphine is indistinguishable from that of pre-33 at 3.0 mg/l (24.6 and 24.5 respectively) suggests that 0.3 and 3.0 mg/l of phosphine have the same toxic effects on N2 and pre-33 nematodes respectively. This result is consistent with the finding that pre-33 is ~9 fold more resistant to phosphine than is the N2 strain. Moreover, the LT50 was determined to be 8.4 hours for N2 when treated with 3.0 mg/l of phosphine, which is only three times faster than pre-33 when exposed to the same level of phosphine. In contrast to the differential toxicity of phosphine between the N2 and pre-33 lines, the delay in reaching reproductive maturity caused by phosphine exposure is indistinguishable between WT and pre-33 nematodes. This indicates that the phosphine induced delay in maturation is independent of the toxic effects of phosphine. Since the inhibition of complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) in the mitochondrial electron transport chain has been proposed as a mechanism of phosphine toxicity, the phosphine effects on cellular ATP metabolism, presented as ATP+ADP content and ATP/ADP ratio, were also assessed. Phosphine exposure (0.3 mg/l, 25 hours) led to a significant decrease in ATP+ADP levels as well as the ATP/ADP ratio in N2 nematodes. Similar results were also detected in pre-33 nematodes when exposed to 3.0 mg/l phosphine for 25 hours. These observations indicate that phosphine can interrupt cellular ATP metabolism, which is associated with phosphine induced mortality. Additionally, the fact that mutant pre-33 can maintain its ATP levels under phosphine exposure at 0.3 mg/l suggests it has a greater ability to maintain mitochondrial function than does the N2 strain. To better understand the mechanism of phosphine toxicity in the wild type N2 strain, gene expression profiling by DNA microarray analysis was employed. A significant overlap between phosphine and DAF-16 regulated genes was detected, supporting the previous finding that the DAF-2/DAF-16 pathway can contribute to phosphine resistance. Phosphine exposure also strongly induced xenobiotic detoxification and stress responses, indicating nematodes are able to sense phosphine induced toxic effects and protect themselves by switching on native detoxification mechanisms. Furthermore, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis were also up-regulated by phosphine, possibly due to an increase in energy demand caused by increased xenobiotic detoxification activities. Consistent with the previous findings that phosphine delays median reproductive age and reduces fertility, expressions of a large number of genes involved in growth, embryonic development and reproduction were suppressed by phosphine. Moreover, the microarray results of seven genes whose expression levels were significantly altered by phosphine were validated using RT-PCR, confirming the robustness of the microarray results. The most direct way to determine the phosphine resistance mechanism in mutant pre-33 is to identify and characterise the mutation itself. Using a classic F1 test, the resistance mutation in pre-33 was determined to be incompletely recessive. Additionally, using three mapping strategies, the resistance mutation was mapped to Chromosome IV between 12,591,683 and 12,879,637 bp with 45 genes located in this small region. In an attempt to identify the resistance gene, the effect of suppressing each of 28 of the 45 genes in the interval was determined using a commercially available gene suppression library. It was observed that only knockdown of gene vha-7 resulted in a slight decrease in phosphine sensitivity (84.6%) compared to N2 (97.6%). However, this result does not clearly implicate vha-7 as the resistance gene in pre-33. The microarray results indicated that linoleate and arachidonate signalling pathways might be activated by phosphine. This was observed as induction of a phospholipase A2 gene that regulates the release of arachidonic acid from the C-2 position of membrane phospholipids, as well as several CYP genes predicted to catalyse the oxidation of linoleate and arachidonate. Therefore, phosphine effects on the linoleate and arachidonate dependent signalling pathways were assessed. It was found that, in the presence of phosphine, the pre-33 mutant has a greater ability to transform linoleate and arachidonate epoxides to diols than does N2. This activity may help pre-33 to better maintain mitochondrial function and, therefore, ATP metabolism than N2 during phosphine exposure. The microarray results also showed that phosphine exposure caused up-regulation of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, indicating phosphine regulation of carbohydrate metabolism. As expected, a preliminary metabonomic analysis by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) into the effect of phosphine exposure on metabolism in N2 nematodes revealed significant alteration of the metabonomic profile.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oxidative Stress</field><field name="subject">Longevity</field><field name="subject">Microarray</field><field name="subject">Metabonomics</field><field name="subject">Mitochondria</field><field name="subject">ATP metabolism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling of Ore Floatability in Industrial Flotation Circuits</field><field name="creator">Kym Runge</field><field name="description">Ore floatability is defined as the propensity of particles to float within a flotation environment and any effective mathematical model of the flotation process must incorporate its effect. The objective of this thesis was to review the ore floatability models in the literature and for those considered appropriate: &#8226; investigate their basic assumptions, &#8226; evaluate the type of experimental data required to derive model parameters, &#8226; and test their predictive capability. A review of the literature identified three different methods of representing ore floatability in flotation circuit models. Two approaches were studied within this thesis, namely the empirically derived floatability component model and the property based floatability component model. The third shaped distribution modelling approach was considered too inflexible a methodology to represent all types of ore floatability distributions. Ore floatability cannot be directly measured but must be inferred from a flotation response. In this thesis, it was investigated using batch laboratory flotation tests which, for a particular system, were all performed using the same set of operating conditions. Any difference in response between tests performed in this way was attributed to a change in ore floatability. Within this thesis, hundreds of batch laboratory flotation tests were performed using samples collected from the streams of seven different industrial flotation circuits. These tests, in combination with circuit survey data, were used to investigate various assumptions underpinning the ore floatability models. The tests also provide the experimental information required to derive the flotation properties of the two chosen ore floatability models. Both the two models investigated in this thesis assume the floatability of a particle in a flotation circuit to remain the same before and after processes in the circuit. A nodal analysis technique was developed by the author to compare the floatability in the feed and product of a flotation circuit process using batch laboratory flotation test information. This technique was used to show that ore floatability is a conserved property across most flotation, mixing and cycloning processes. In the cases where floatability was not conserved, it is suspected that the surfaces of the particles have changed due to oxidation, adsorption of hydrophilic species or decomposition of reagent surface species. Ore floatability was usually not conserved across processes which are designed to change particle properties (e.g. reagent addition and regrinding). An additional requirement of the ore floatability models is that all particles assigned to a particular component must float with a similar flotation rate. Sizing and liberation analysis of batch laboratory flotation test data showed that property based floatability component models based on size and liberation alone do not satisfy this criteria. It was concluded that a property based model would need to include information about the chemical state of the particle surfaces. As this type of measurement was considered beyond the scope of this thesis, no further analysis of this type of model was possible. Techniques for determining the empirically derived floatability component model parameters were studied using statistical techniques. This analysis showed that unique, stable parameters could be obtained by fitting the models to match multiple batch flotation test data collected at the same time as a circuit survey. It was found that a minimum of four batch laboratory flotation tests were required to derive statistically stable parameters. The use of one laboratory batch flotation test (the traditional method of parameter derivation) results in parameters which are highly sensitive to the error in the batch laboratory flotation test data. A methodology to simulate and predict ore grade and recovery in a flotation circuit based on different ore floatability particle groupings was developed by the author. A theoretical analysis was performed using this algorithm which showed that a two floating component and one non-floating component model produced similar predictions to a multi-component model developed using size and liberation information in a circuit subject to changes in cell operation, residence time and circuit configuration. It was therefore concluded that a discrete floatability component model has the ability to represent, what is in reality, a more complex particle floatability distribution. The analysis performed in this thesis shows that the empirically derived ore floatability component model is a valid method of representing ore floatability within a flotation circuit model which does not contain grinding or reagent addition processes. Parameters of the model can be derived with statistical confidence using multiple batch flotation test data. To effectively model ore floatability in circuits containing regrinding or staged reagent addition, ore floatability models need to be developed which incorporate parameters related to the physical properties of the ore. It is therefore recommended that research be performed to determine the effect of size, liberation and chemical conditioning on the ore floatability of a particle and how these effects are best incorporated into an ore floatability model.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">flotation</field><field name="subject">ore floatability</field><field name="subject">modelling and simulation</field><field name="subject">floatability components</field><field name="subject">particle size</field><field name="subject">liberation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178444</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Agronomic, physiological and genetic studies on a dwarf mutant of cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.)</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) is an important cash crop in the coastal areas of Papua New Guinea (PNG). In 2000, a mutant cocoa genotype MJ 12-226, with abnormal growth characteristics was identified at the Cocoa and Coconut Institute of PNG. The mutant, found among progenies of the cross Scavina 12 x Nanay 149, was characterized by dwarfing, small and narrow leaves, a small root system and strong branching habit. This study was designed to improve the understanding of the dwarf cocoa mutant and identify its relevance to future cocoa farming. The specific objectives are to investigate the feasibility of using a dwarf mutant of cocoa as a commercial rootstock for various hybrid cocoa clones, to study the genetics of this dwarf mutant and the role of plant hormones in differentiating this mutant from the normal phenotype. This study was carried out at the Cocoa and Coconut Institute of PNG, Rabaul, Papua New Guinea, and at the University of Queensland, Gatton Campus, Australia. The comparative study of mutant and normal cocoa seedlings revealed distinct vegetative differences between the two genotypes at the nursery stage. The largest effects of the mutant genotype are on stem elongation, short internodes, multiple stems, root growth and leaf growth. The agronomic results indicated that the mutant rootstock significantly reduced tree vigour at least in the early years. When used as a rootstock, the mutant had a significant dwarfing effect on scion growth of cocoa clones in the nursery and persisted in the field 12 months after planting. After that, the cocoa clones grafted on mutant rootstock reverted to normal growth. It was postulated that the accumulation of endogenous growth substances and cambial activity between the scion (normal) and the rootstock overcame the dwarfing effect of the mutant genotype. Yield and vegetative data collection from this trial ceased on May 2006 and recommenced in May 2007 to allow trees to recover from heavy canopy pruning due to cocoa pod borer attack. This resulted in one year loss of yield and vegetative data from this experiment. The first two years&#8217; yield data indicated no significant differences between mutant, normal segregants and commercial rootstocks. However, cocoa clones bud grafted on these mutant rootstocks produced significantly greater yield at higher planting density compared with lower densities and this was sustained for two years. However, it might be expected that competition among cocoa trees would increase with increased size of trees, favouring low density planting and reducing the differential performance of the trees under high density planting with time. The major advantages of reducing tree vigour are to improve the harvest index, ease of harvesting, pruning and overall management of the trees. The continuation of this study to collect mature tree yield data (from fifth to eighth years) would confirm these results. This work has also demonstrated for the first time that cocoa clones grafted on mutant rootstock can produce similar yields to clones grafted on normal or commercial rootstocks. Moreover, this study has also established that cocoa clones derived from orthotropic scions can yield the same as plagiotropic scions when grafted on to either mutant or normal rootstocks. Therefore, it is proposed that mutant rootstocks and orthtropic scions should also be considered for future use in cocoa farming. The strong branching habit and dwarfing stature of the mutant suggested that the mutation affects the quantity or the balance of plant growth hormones, or both. The effect of exogenously applied gibberellic acid (GA3) on developmental processes in dwarf mutant and normal cocoa seedlings was studied. Both dwarf mutant and normal one month old cocoa seedlings responded to gibberellic acid (GA3) by accelerated longitudinal growth, especially seedling height. Paclobutrazol (PBZ) applied to normal cocoa seedlings altered the growth so that they almost resembled the mutant phenotype. It was postulated that PBZ prevented GA biosynthesis in the normal cocoa seedlings and therefore decreased bioactive auxin (IAA) which, in turn, then promoted lateral shoot growth; PBZ also slightly retarded plant growth. Synthetic auxin (IBA/NAA) significantly inhibited lateral bud sprouting and growth of intact, decapitated and nodal segments of mutant and normal cocoa seedlings compared with control and those treated with IAA. It appears that the mutant and normal cocoa genotypes have a similar capacity to metabolize IAA and this capacity was much greater than for synthetic auxins. The results suggested that auxin levels in the mutant seedlings were probably limiting, and therefore affected biosynthesis of gibberellic acid thus resulting in the dwarfing characteristics of the mutant cocoa genotype. However, analysis of endogenous IAA and GA1 levels at four months old did not reveal differences between the mutant and normal seedlings. The present genetic studies which included backcrossing, test crossing and selfing of F1 progenies confirmed earlier work on the mutant and showed that the mutant was probably heterozygous (Dd). The allele (DD) in mutant cocoa is probably lethal in nature because the phenotype of the homozygote was not observed amongst the mutant progenies. Mutant segregants were obtained in a 1:1 ratio only when the mutant clone was used as the female; however, when the mutant was used as male, very few mutant segregants were obtained. This suggested selective pollen viability (pollen grains carrying the D allele are nonviable) or an incompatible reaction between pollen tubes (D carrying pollen) and style or ovule. The selfing and test-crosses of F1 progenies resulted in deviation from the expected 3:1 segregation ratio to a 1:1 ratio.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/uq:178454</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Agronomic, physiological and genetic studies on a dwarf mutant of cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.)</field><field name="creator">Eremas Tade</field><field name="description">Cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) is an important cash crop in the coastal areas of Papua New Guinea (PNG).

It made use of the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study (AusDiab). The AusDiab study is a cross sectional study where baseline data on 11,247 participants were collected in 1999-2000. Participants were recruited from a stratified sample of Australians aged &#8805; 25 years, residing in 42 randomly selected urban and non-urban areas (Census Collector Districts) of the six states of Australia and the Northern Territory. The AusDiab study collected an enormous amount of clinical and laboratory data. During the 2004-05 follow-up AusDiab survey, questions about birthweight were included. Participants were asked to state their birthweight, the likely accuracy of the stated birthweight and the source of their stated birthweight. Four hundred and twelve chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients were approached, and 339 agreed to participate in the study. The patients completed the same questionnaire. Medical records were reviewed to check the diagnoses, causes of kidney trouble and SCr levels. Two control subjects, matched for gender and age, were selected for each CKD patient from participants in the AusDiab study who reported their birthweight. Among 7,157 AusDiab participants who responded to the questionnaire, 4,502 reported their birthweights, with a mean (standard deviation) of 3.4 (0.7) kg. The benefit and disadvantages of these data are discussed in chapter three. The data were analysed for the relationship between birthweight and adult body size and composition, disorders of glucose regulation, blood pressure, lipid abnormalities, cardiovascular diseases and glomerular filtration rate. Low birthweight was associated with smaller body build and lower lean mass and total body water in both females and males. In addition low birthweight was associated with central obesity and higher body fat percentage in females, even after taking into account current physical activity and socioeconomic status. Fasting plasma glucose, post load glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin were strongly and inversely correlated with birthweight. In those with low birthweight (&lt; 2.5 kg), the risks for having impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes and all abnormalities combined were increased by 1.75, 2.22, 2.76 and 2.28 for females and by 1.40, 1.32, 1.98 and 1.49 for males compared to those with normal birthweight (&#8805; 2.5 kg), respectively. Low birthweight individuals were at higher risk for having high blood pressure &#8805; 140/90 mmHg and &#8805; 130/85 mmHg compared to those with normal birthweight. People with low birthweight showed a trend towards increased risk for high cholesterol (&#8805; 5.5 mmol/l) compared to those of normal birthweight. Females with low birthweight had increased risk for high low density lipoprotein cholesterol (&#8805; 3.5 mmol/l) and triglyceride levels (&#8805; 1.7 mmol/l) when compared to those with normal birthweight. Males with low birthweight exhibited increased risk for low levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (&lt;0.9 mmol/l) than those with normal birthweight. Females with low birthweight were at least 1.39, 1.40, 2.30 and 1.47 times more likely to have angina, coronary artery disease, stroke and overall cardiovascular diseases respectively, compared to those &#8805; 2.5 kg. Similarly, males with low birthweight were 1.76, 1.48, 3.34 and 1.70 times more likely to have angina, coronary artery disease, stroke and overall cardiovascular diseases compared to those &#8805; 2.5 kg, respectively. The estimated glomerular filtration rate was strongly and positively associated with birthweight, with a predicted increase of 2.6 ml/min (CI 2.1, 3.2) and 3.8 (3.0, 4.5) for each kg of birthweight for females and males, respectively. The odd ratio (95% confidence interval) for low glomerular filtration rate (&lt;61.0 ml/min for female and &lt; 87.4 male) in people of low birthweight compared with those of normal birthweight was 2.04 (1.45, 2.88) for female and 3.4 (2.11, 5.36) for male. One hundred and eighty-nineCKD patients reported their birthweight; 106 were male. Their age was 60.3(15) years. Their birthweight was 3.27 (0.62) kg, vs 3.46 (0.6) kg for their AusDiab controls, p&lt;0.001 and the proportions with birthweight&lt;2.5 kg were 12.17% and 4.44%, p&lt;0.001. Among CKD patients, 22.8%, 21.7%, 18% and 37.6% were in CKD stages 2, 3, 4 and 5 respectively. Birthweights by CKD stage and their AusDiab controls were as follows: 3.38 (0.52) vs 3.49 (0.52), p=0.251 for CKD2; 3.28 (0.54) vs 3.44 (0.54), p=0.121 for CKD3; 3.19 (0.72) vs 3.43 (0.56), p= 0.112 for CKD4 and 3.09 (0.65) vs 3.47 (0.67), p&lt;0.001 for CKD5. The results demonstrate that in an affluent Western country with a good adult health profile, low birthweight people were predisposed to higher rates of glycaemic dysregulation, high blood pressure, dyslipidaemia, cardiovascular diseases and lower glomerular filtration rate in adult life. In all instances it would be prudent to adopt policies of intensified whole of life surveillance of lower birthweight people, anticipating this risk. The general public awareness of the effect of low birthweight on development of chronic diseases in later life is of vital importance. The general public, in addition to the awareness of people in medical practice of the role of low birthweight, will lead to a better management of this group of our population that is increasingly surviving into adulthood.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">birth weight</field><field

accurate record or true record?</field><field name="creator">William A. Park</field><field name="description">The Australian Government Internet database, the World War Two Nominal Roll, is problematised and then analysed as a document of patron-sponsored alternative journalism as described by Atton and Hamilton, because it attempts to fulfill functions previously completed in Australia by newspaper publishers and television producers. These functions &#8211; of discovering, establishing, editing, contextualizing, recording and publishing memory &#8211; have long been regarded as roles of journalism. Later they have been seen as roles also of literary publishing and documentary filmmaking, and most recently of online records management. They became especially evident in the 1990s, the decade of the 50th anniversary of many World War II events, during which many anniversary supplements were published in Australian newspapers and in television documentaries. Partly as a result of this major anniversary, the Australian Government undertook the tasks of discovering, establishing, editing, recording, contextualizing, and publishing World War II military memories as an online database known as the World War Two Nominal Roll. The enactment of this large task required the engagement of a subcontractor who tendered on the basis of skills in records management, and the adoption of a methodology which offered some level of quality assurance of the outputs. The problematisation of this project suggests that the engagement of the subcontractor and the methodology adopted for the World War Two Nominal Roll are analogous to the engagement of professionalized journalists, and the adoption of recognised journalistic methods, for the publication of a media artifact such as an anniversary supplement. In that light, this thesis compares the error rates evident in the Nominal Roll with the literature of error rates in contemporary newspapers, and compares some of the audience effects of publishing the Nominal Roll with those of publishing newspapers. This involves a comprehensive examination and critique of the physical nature of the Roll and the processes of its production. The analysis in the first place suggests that the database Roll is overall more trustworthy than established journalism artifacts but in detail more susceptible to errors of fact and context and less likely to be corrected. This leads to the second assessment that the publication of the database Roll is less effective than newspapers as a means of memorialisation. Finally, the findings suggest that the processes deployed in the compilation of the database Roll would have benefitted from the adoption of aspects of ordinary journalistic routines not used by the database publishers. Reasons for this are proposed and discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">400000 Journalism, Librarianship and Curatorial Studies</field><field name="subject">Records</field><field name="subject">Alternative journalism</field><field name="subject">Journalism</field><field name="subject">Newspapers</field><field name="subject">Accuracy</field><field name="subject">World War 2 Nominal Roll Database</field><field name="subject">Veterans</field><field name="subject">Commemoration</field><field name="subject">Retention</field><field name="subject">Military recruitment</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How do we respond to &amp; cope with (repeated) exposure to death in TV news? Desensitisation or Personalisation: An application of Terror Management Theory</field><field name="creator">Zoe Nielsen</field><field name="description">Abstract This thesis addresses the issue of the effects of (repeated) exposure to death-related news content systematically and programmatically through a four-phase research project using a Terror Management Theory (TMT) framework. The central research questions that are posed include, &#8216;What are the effects for individuals of exposure to death in TV news?&#8217;; &#8216;When will individuals personalise death-related TV news as opposed to feel desensitised to it?&#8217;; and, &#8216;How do individuals cope with repeated exposure to death in TV news?&#8217; The first three chapters provide an extensive literature review that integrates current research from the media effects and mass communication literature with that of experimental findings based on TMT. This leads to an overview of the research program. Then, a series of empirical chapters present findings from six experiments, using a mixed methods approach that incorporates both quantitative and qualitative data and analyses. Finally, in Chapter 9 trends within the quantitative and qualitative data across the studies are discussed along with the theoretical and broader implications of the findings. Overall, there are three primary aims of the research. (1.) To examine a) whether death in news media can prime personal mortality salience, thus eliciting death thought accessibility and cultural worldview fluid compensation defensive outcomes as theorised by TMT (increased nationalism, endorsement of affiliation needs and self-esteem bolstering), and b) whether it is only particular portrayals of death in news media that work this way (i.e., whether there are critical factors such as viewer-victim similarity or level of exposure, as identified in the media effects literature) that play a significant moderating role. (2.) To explore whether it is necessary for the outcomes of exposure to death in news media to be defensive or whether there are alternative and more pro-social outcomes related to the extent that the viewer elaborates cognitively on the content or views more rationally (as implicated in Cozzolino, Staples, Meyers, &amp; Sambceti, 2004). This could be as a function of individual differences (e.g., in cognitive thinking style) or as a function of the situational or contextual factors that prompt one to consider death-related news content more personally (emotionally) versus rationally. (3.) To ask about the &#8220;repeated&#8221; nature of death primes in news media, given that news media is unique in its daily emphasis on death-related content. Towards this aim we seek to answer the following: Does repeated exposure lead to accentuation of the defensive fluid compensation effects or does it lead to diminished effects because of desensitisation and depersonalisation? This third aim is potentially the most complex and is an under-researched area with important real-world implications. Specifically, Study 1 addresses reactions to death in TV news using a written stimulus task for a range of dependent variables&#8211; namely, death thought accessibility, cultural worldview endorsement, and cultural worldview defence. Examining the same dependent variables, Studies 2 and 3 explore the effects of actual TV news footage of a bus crash with multiple fatalities and the role of viewer-victim similarity. Study 4 examines what happens when explicit instructions to imagine your own death are given while watching the same TV news footage. Next, Study 5 examines whether more pro-social effects rather than the typical TMT defensive reactions are possible when a method by Cozzolino et al. (2004) that involves deeper death reflection and the role of cognitive elaboration are explored. Finally, Study 6 addresses the question of repeated exposure to death in TV news, with a focus on whether prior death exposure leads to attenuation or heightening of typical TMT defensive outcomes. Together, results from the six studies indicate that exposure to death-related TV news does not lead inevitably to defensive reactions. While there is strong evidence that death in TV news increases death thought accessibility (especially compared to a non-death TV news control), critically, whether personal mortality salience (as evidenced by self and other death thoughts) is resultant is more variable. Qualitative data shows that people have a range of defensive strategies and resources available to them and that we are honed at detecting personal relevance. Rather than viewing desensitisation as a negative by-product of TV news consumption it seems that the self-protective features of desensitisation are note-worthy. Detachment or neutrality seems to help individuals cope with the barrage of death-related images and sound bytes broadcast via TV news. Conversely, a sensitivity to detect personal relevance helps serve an important surveillance function also geared towards self-protection and meaning making. When there is maximal similarity with the victims of TV news stories portraying death, we can expect viewers to perceive high personal relevance, to personalise news content and to process the content more emotionally, as opposed to feeling desensitised. Although the buffering role of high rational thinking was weak overall, contrary to TMT-based predictions higher rational thinkers were found to be more prone to cultural worldview defence in a number of instances. The theoretical implications for TMT, social identity-based theories, Cozzolino et al.s (2004) work, and relevant media effects literature are discussed. The primary implication for TMT is evidence that death-related TV news footage has the capacity to make personal mortality salient and that higher death thought accessibility often can be evoked by death-related TV news. However, when subsequent measurement of cultural worldview defence is undertaken after a three-minute delay, higher death thought accessibility does not necessarily lead to consistent evidence of defensive fluid compensation effects. These two dependent variables have not been measured together in the literature to date, so these findings provide a significant theoretical distinction for TMT. While death in TV news more likely promotes procreation or family-related defensiveness than national bias, a range of factors (such as detecting self-relevance, viewer-victim similarity, and one&#8217;s ability to adopt a rational thinking style) moderate effects in various situations. In particular, factors such as contextual news features, rational thinking, shock value or spontaneous realisation of relevance, and reminders of one&#8217;s own family or of one&#8217;s own or others&#8217; death are important.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Terror Management Theory, death, mortality salience, television news, desensitisation, media effects.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178515</field></doc><doc><field name="title">LEARNING MATHEMATICS WITH TECHNOLOGY FROM A SOCIAL PERSPECTIVE: A STUDY OF SECONDARY STUDENTS&#8217; INDIVIDUAL AND COLLABORATIVE PRACTICES IN A TECHNOLOGICALLY RICH MATHEMATICS CLASSROOM</field><field name="creator">Vincent Geiger</field><field name="description">Abstract The role of collaborative classroom practices, and of technology, in students&#8217; learning of mathematics, is now receiving increased attention in curriculum and policy documents in Australia and internationally. The implementation of pedagogical reforms associated with these areas, however, has been limited due to a range of theoretical and practical concerns. An issue which has emerged from separate interests in technology and collaborative practice is the role of digital tools in enhancing meaningful learning in both individual and collaborative group settings. While the corpus of research literature in the area of technology mediated learning in mathematics is now significant, much of the focus of studies in this area has been concerned with the effect of technology on individual learning outcomes within specific topic domains. Research is needed into the role of digital tools within collaborative classroom environments. This study investigated the various roles of technology in mediating students&#8217; learning, from both individual and collective perspectives, within an authentic, senior secondary classroom setting and sought to identify patterns of student behaviour within this environment. The theoretical framework for the study drew on two bodies of educational research. Firstly, social theories of learning, including Vygotskian socio-cultural ideas, the field of learning discourses, and distributed cognition, were considered. Secondly, research literature associated with approaches to learning mathematics with the assistance of digital technologies, including ideas related to tool co-construction and instrumental genesis, are examined. Because the focus of this study is on authentic systems of activity rather than individual student outcomes, a naturalistic approach to data collection and analysis was employed. Research was conducted in two senior secondary classrooms over a two and a half year period (1997 &#8211; 1999). This involved a pilot study (1997 &#8211; 1998) and overlapping main study (1998 &#8211; 1999) which were conducted with two different cohorts of students. The investigation was carried out by a teacher-researcher with the support of a research assistant. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected using: student surveys; individual and whole class student interviews; stimulated recall procedures; videotaping of episodes of students working as individuals, in small groups and in whole class settings; and longitudinal participant observation. Data analysis techniques were chosen to match the form and nature of available data and were sensitive to the generation and confirmation of categories of emergent student behaviour. This process was iterative and included an additional phase devoted to category refinement and eventually to theory development. Patterns of behaviour for students working with digital technologies were identified and the metaphors of Master, Servant, Partner and Extension-of-self were chosen to describe the categories that emerged. These categories were further developed into a framework which describes students&#8217; interaction with technology while learning mathematics in individual, small group and whole class settings. The theoretical and practical implications of this study include: the identification of the role of digital technologies in mediating the social practices within authentic mathematics classrooms; the potential of technology to empower students as individuals and as collectives of co-dependent learners; and the potential shift in power structures between teachers and students within mainstream classroom when students are so empowered.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">technology</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">computer</field><field name="subject">calculator</field><field name="subject">collaboration</field><field name="subject">community</field><field name="subject">inquiry</field><field name="subject">practice</field><field name="subject">digital</field><field name="subject">tools</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178520</field></doc><doc><field name="title">NUMERICAL METHODS FOR SIMULATING THE FLOW OF DETONATION PRODUCTS WITHIN AN EXPLICIT FRACTURE NETWORK FORMED BY THE COALESCENCE OF CRACKS DURING BLASTING</field><field name="creator">Marc Robert Ruest</field><field name="description">Abstract DEM (Distinct Element Method) models have found numerous applications in a number of engineering disciplines, such as material handling and transport, chemical, industrial, civil, mining and mineral processing. The thesis describes developments using PFC3D (Particle Flow Code in 3D) for simulating rock fragmentation by commercial explosives. Emphasis is on the realistic simulation of explosive detonation in the blasthole as well as the flow of explosive gas from the blasthole, through the fracture network and venting to the atmosphere. Detonation can be initialized at any point along discretized blastholes and proceed up or down the hole according to the Velocity of Detonation of the explosive. Each of the explosive properties (pressure, density, extent of reaction, energy and their time derivatives) is computed according to the conservation equations and the explosive equation of state at any point along the hole. At initiation, the product calculation begins at the sonic locus with input of the detonation product provided by the non-ideal detonation code Vixen-n. The Taylor wave is then computed as a function of the blasthole expansion, which depends on the rock mass response to loading. The explosive gas is treated as a non-steady, compressible fluid and can flow through an arbitrary and evolving fracture network developed in the rock mass as a function of explosive loading. The fracture network (and flow paths) is defined by the coalescence of discrete macro-cracks. The gas has the effect of draining the blasthole and loading the fracture surface by its pressure and drag forces. Fracture intersection with free-surfaces is monitored and venting to the atmosphere is allowed. Validation of the fluid flow scheme is performed by comparing numeric results to analytic solutions for flow in shock tubes. The complete model is demonstrated by simulating stress only models, gas flow models and complete models of field-scale blasts.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Explosive, detonation, gas flow, compressible, blasting, modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178532</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Variable Structure Control based FACTS Controller Design</field><field name="creator">Gang Cao</field><field name="description">Along with the increasing scale of the power system and stressed operation in the transmission network, the stability margin is reduced considerably. As a traditional solution, the constructions of new transmission lines and generators sometimes are constrained by local environmental and regulatory constraints. Another characteristic of a modern network is the higher number of transmission inter-connections which appear in the large-scale power system. As an economic benefit, inter-connection can reduce the cost of electricity and enhance system reliability [1]. Those inter-connected tie lines are operated normally under heavy flow to maximize the usage benefit. This characteristic contributes to the complexity of operating and controlling the system. In recent years, along with the development of power electronic devices, the Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) has been used in the system as an alternative solution. It can maximize the usage benefit of the HV transmission line and make the large-scale power system more controllable. By using FACTS devices, the system can survive serious system contingencies with real-time control action, instead of providing a large steady state stability margin. Therefore, the system transfer capacity can be significantly increased. Electromechanical oscillations are observed in today's power system; such oscillations are recognized as a major concern in power system operation. Once begun, the oscillations may continue for a while before being halted by the damping torque from the system, or they may continue to grow (inadequate damping) and eventually cause system instability by losing synchronicity. The traditional and widely applied solution for oscillation damping is the Power System Stabilizer (PSS), which is efficient in damping local mode oscillation and inter-area oscillation in certain conditions. In recent years, research and development of the application of FACTS devices in suppressing system oscillations, especially for inter-area mode oscillation damping, has attracted increasing interest [1]. The primary objective of this thesis is to design robust FACTS controllers for enhancing power system dynamic stability by damping low frequency electromechanical oscillations. Recently, various nonlinear control techniques have been applied in power system control. The performance of nonlinear controllers is influenced by the parameter uncertainty and external disturbance. This thesis will present a novel approach of a robust Variable Structure Control (VSC)-based FACTS controller for damping multi-mode oscillations. Robust performances of the proposed controllers in different power systems are demonstrated by computer simulation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Power System Analysis</field><field name="subject">Stability</field><field name="subject">FACTS</field><field name="subject">Variable Structure Control</field><field name="subject">Reactive Compensation</field><field name="subject">Oscillation Damping</field><field name="subject">Energy Function</field><field name="subject">Direct Method</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178558</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kleinian Analysis of Organisations: Implications for Employee Health and Well-Being</field><field name="creator">John McManus</field><field name="description">Abstract A Kleinian Analysis of Organisations: Implications for Employee Health and Well-Being. This dissertation considers research that was conducted into the impact of organisational style of operation upon the health and well-being of individual employees. A Kleinian analysis of organisations, from a psychoanalytic perspective, highlights the defining characteristics of different organisations within the study. The intent of the thesis is to argue that the different types of organisations impact upon the health and well-being of their employees. Six organisations were studied using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Extensive interviews were conducted with 120 employees from those organisations. A Kleinian Analysis Questionnaire and a Kleinian Analysis Rating Scale (new psychoanalytic techniques aimed at promoting dialogue with employees) assisted in the analysis and positioning of the organisations. The findings suggested that organisations can be distinguished in Kleinian terms and that these differences produce a range of health effects for employees. In the qualitative parts of this research extensive discussions took place with the employees of organisations considered to be in either the Depressive position or the Paranoid &#8211; Schizoid positions. Using the Kleinian Analysis Questionnaire (KAQ), a great deal was revealed about the emotional lives of their organisations and the impact of these realities on their own individual emotional lives and on their mental and physical health. Organisational employee assistance programs (EAPs) were considered in terms of how support was extended to employees within the studied organisations and how the efficacy and utilization of EAPs were affected by organisational classification of either Depressive or Paranoid-Schizoid. A range of quantitative measures were employed in the study and included the broad health measures SF-36, the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), the Schedule for the Evaluation of Individual Quality of Life - Direct Weighting (SEIQoL-DW) and the Work Environment Scale (WES). Employees in the Depressive organisations described their workplaces as open, encouraging, creative, flexible and democratic in process. They described how the stated values and mission statements of their organisations were consistent with their own personal values and how their work as described by Gabriel (2002) enhanced their sense of self esteem and self image. There were abundant examples of their organisations providing support, described in psychoanalytic terms as &#8216;containment&#8217;. The quantitative results, in part, supported the qualitative results by demonstrating that the employees of Depressive organisations had a better rate of recovery from psychological issues arising from personal and workplace matters. In contrast, employees from Paranoid &#8211; Schizoid organisations described their workplaces as defensive, blaming, scapegoating, rigid and concrete, where organisational behaviour was often inconsistent with the organisation&#8217;s stated values and mission statements. They described some of the competitive activity as inconsistent with their own personal values and at times giving rise to anxiety. This discord had reflections on the emotional health of individuals. This was borne out in the quantitative aspects of the study which also found that the mental health of individuals and their rate of recovery from psychological issues were adversely affected by the lack of &#8216;containment&#8217; afforded to them by their organisations. The results strongly demonstrated the value of EAPs as mechanisms of support for employees and revealed differences in the impact upon health and well-being of employees between the two Kleinian organisational types in addition to differences in the levels of utilization and involvement.

Current gene delivery carriers can be divided into two classes: viral and non-viral delivery systems. Although the viral carriers are highly efficient due to their invasive nature, safety concerns may restrict their application in clinical settings. Synthetic non-viral carriers attract increasing attention because they are less toxic and allow readily modification. Non-viral carrier mediated gene delivery involves several processes. They must condense DNA into small particles, allow membrane penetration and protect DNA from extracellular and intracellular degradative enzymes. In the present study, a small library of carriers containing various combinations of cell penetrating peptide TAT, SV40 large T protein nuclear localisation signal (NLS) and cationic dendrimer of 7 lysine residues (DEN) was synthesised and tested for their ability to deliver DNA to mammalian cells. We evaluated the contribution of each component as well as the combination of the components on DNA condensation, uptake and gene expression. It was found that all carriers condensed DNA and protected DNA from DNase degradation. We showed that the TAT peptide was essential, but not sufficient, for uptake of exogenous DNA. The addition of either NLS or DEN significantly enhanced uptake. The most efficient carrier contained all three components (DEN-NLS-TAT). The carriers were able to deliver DNA in the presence of serum and were non-toxic to cells at up to 30 &#956;M. However, for those peptides that facilitated DNA uptake, the complexes were targeted to intracellular compartments that required a fusogenic agent, such as chloroquine, before gene expression was observed. Modifications were introduced to the initial carrier library in order to circumvent the chloroquine dependence. The addition of cell penetrating peptide penetratin, virus derived fusogenic peptide or lipoamino acid C12 enhanced either DNA uptake or endosomal release. However, none of the modified carriers were able to produce high level transgene expression in the absence of chloroquine. We also found that the carriers containing lipid components were able to deliver DNA to T-lymphocytes derived cells, which are usually resistant to transfection. However, the toxicity of the lipid-based carriers needs to be reduced before further application. We also evaluated the function of chloroquine as a gene expression enhancer. We demonstrated that chloroquine did not enhance expression solely by promoting endosomal release. This was supported by the fact that fusogenic peptide and endosomal disruptive reagents (bafilomycin A1 and monensin) did not improve gene expression. Other properties of chloroquine, such as DNA protection and transcription enhancement, may also contribute to gene expression. We characterised the uptake mechanism of DEN-NLS-TAT in HeLa cell lines. We found that the uptake of DEN-NLS-TAT/DNA complex in HeLa cell line was mainly via receptor-mediated endocytosis and caveolae endocytosis. Moreover, various intracellular processes, such as intact cytoskeleton and microtubule network, tyrosine and PI 3 kinase activity, and membrane cholesterol were also required for the uptake of the carrier/DNA complex. In conclusion, the results from the present study demonstrated that multi-component peptide-based carriers are versatile carriers for the delivery of plasmid DNA in human cells. The results have improved our understanding of the role of chloroquine as a widely used gene expression enhancer which may be useful in the future improvement of non-viral gene delivery carriers. A strategy to overcome the dependence on chloroquine for gene expression or reduce the toxicity of chloroquine will be necessary for further in vivo applications. The current carrier library may also be used to delivery other cargos such as siRNA or protein to human cells.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">non-viral gene delivery carrier</field><field name="subject">cell penetrating peptide</field><field name="subject">dendrimer</field><field name="subject">chloroquine</field><field name="subject">endocytosis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178562</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation and Function of Schlafen in Macrophage Biology</field><field name="creator">Wendy van Zuijlen</field><field name="description">Macrophages are involved in many aspects of both the innate and acquired immunity, and participate in tissue homeostasis, bone remodelling, wound healing, and tissue repair. When their function becomes dysregulated, they contribute to the initiation and progression of inflammatory diseases. Genes expressed in activated macrophages are likely to play an important role in inflammation and/or immunity. One family of genes that is highly expressed in activated macrophages is the Schlafen (Slfn) gene family. Given that very little is known about the function of this family, particularly in macrophages, this study focused on the regulation and function of one family member, namely Slfn-4. The transcriptional regulation of Slfn-4 was characterised in murine macrophages. The expression of Slfn-4 was transiently down regulated during macrophage differentiation and dramatically up regulated in response to activation signals including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and dsRNA Poly(I:C). A potential association with inflammation was further suggested by the enhanced expression of Slfn-4 in a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis. Further investigations into transcriptional regulation of Slfn-4 revealed that it belongs to the subset of genes that are type I interferon (IFN)-inducible. This finding is consistent with the predicted transcription factor binding sites in the putative promoter of Slfn-4, and suggests a role for Slfn-4 in the antiviral response. To gain further insight into the function of Slfn-4 in macrophage biology, in vitro over-expression approaches were undertaken and its cellular localisation in macrophages was characterised. In resting and activated macrophages, Slfn-4 exhibited a cytoplasmic and strong perinuclear localisation. Additional studies were carried out to investigate the in vivo biology of Slfn-4 in macrophages. For this purpose, the Csf1r-GAL4VP16/UAS-ECFP (referred to as &#8220;MacBlue&#8221;) transgenic mouse line was first characterised. Enhanced cyan fluorescent (ECFP) reporter expression in the MacBlue transgenic mice was specifically detected in cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system during embryonic development and adulthood. The MacBlue transgenic mouse line was next used to drive expression of Slfn-4 in cells of the myeloid lineage in vivo, and to examine the phenotype of this line. Specific over-expression of Slfn-4 in cells of the myeloid lineage in vivo altered the percentage of peripheral blood monocytes and caused extramedullary hematopoiesis. In summary, this thesis demonstrated that Slfn-4 expression is dynamically regulated during macrophage differentiation and activation, and the enforced Slfn-4 over-expression in cells of the myeloid lineage perturbs normal monocyte/macrophage development.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Schlafen</field><field name="subject">macrophage</field><field name="subject">Gene Regulation</field><field name="subject">Cell Differentiation</field><field name="subject">Myelopoiesis</field><field name="subject">inflammation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178565</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 Transactivator of Transcription</field><field name="creator">Dhivakaren Sivakumaran</field><field name="description">The transactivator of transcription protein (Tat) of human immunode&#64257;ciency virus (HIV) plays an important role in both viral replication and AIDS pathogenesis. Tat is responsible for enhancing HIV-speci&#64257;c transcription, without which production of infectious virus is severely limited. Ongoing research, however, has identi&#64257;ed a plethora of additional functions attributable to Tat including regulating additional HIV processes, altering the homeostasis of both infected and uninfected cells, and being directly involved in AIDS-related neuropathology and cancer. Tat thus plays a diverse role in both viral replication and pathogenesis. What is the relative importance of Tat&#8217;s additional functions compared to its principle function of transactivation? This question is explored in Chapter 2 in which tat clones from an epidemiologicallylinked transmission cohort were functionally tested. tat sequences were isolated and cloned from the cohort members at various time points and assessed for transactivation potential. The data revealed that transmission of HIV resulted in the selection of mutations in tat that were host speci&#64257;c and that impacted on the Tat clones&#8217; abilities to transactivate. No correlation, however, was observed between the transactivation potentials of the Tat clones and the AIDS progression statuses of the hosts. The host-speci&#64257;c tat mutations may instead re&#64258;ect the selection of variants &#64257;tter in one or more of Tat&#8217;s other functions. This therefore leads to the hypothesis that Tat functions in addition to transactivation are in&#64258;uential in AIDS pathogenesis and are subject to selective pressures during HIV transmission. Tat&#8217;s &#64258;exibility and diversity of functions are mediated by de&#64257;ned functional domains. One of the most important of these is the basic domain, a highly conserved region encompassing a unique nuclear localisation signal (NLS). The NLS allows Tat to localise to the cell nucleus to participate in transactivation. However, many of Tat&#8217;s additional functions require Tat to be outside of the nucleus or even outside of the cell. It is currently unknown how the NLS is modulated to enable Tat nuclear egress, but it may involve post-translational modi&#64257;cations of NLS residues. In Chapter 3, protein arginine methyltransferase 6 (PRMT6) is demonstrated to alter the localisation of Tat within the nucleus and increase the half-life of Tat within the cell. Both of these effects require the methylation activity of PRMT6 and two NLS residues, arginines 52 and 53, previously described to be substrates for PRMT6 methylation. The results suggest that PRMT6 primes Tat for functions outside of the nucleus by altering its subcellular localisation and increasing its stability. The critical role of the basic domain in Tat function is highlighted in Chapter 4 in which mutation of the basic domain led to dysregulation of HIV replication. The mutant, referred to as Nullbasic, has characteristics similar to transdominant Tat mutants, such as suppressing transactivation and localising to the cell cytoplasm. Surprisingly, Nullbasic potently inhibits HIV infectivity by strongly downregulating the expression of envelope, the key molecule involved in cell attachment and entry. Part of this downregulation is attributable to Nullbasic interfering with the nuclear export of envelope-encoding mRNA as a result of altering the subcellular localisation of Rev. However, an additional mechanism of interference is required to fully explain the strong suppression of envelope protein observed in cells. The data allude to a role for Tat in promoting envelope mRNA translation, a role subverted by mutating the basic domain. Taken together, these studies highlight the importance of a diversity of Tat functions to HIV replication and AIDS pathogenesis. Further, they emphasise the critical role of the basic domain to Tat function. Modi&#64257;cations of the basic domain not only in&#64258;uence function, but also regulate Tat spatially and temporally. Dysregulation of the basic domain by mutation not only subverts Tat function, but also elicits antiviral activity at multiple steps of the HIV lifecycle. The study of Tat and its basic domain is crucial in order to understand its role in HIV/AIDS and to recognise Tat as a pathogenic agent in its own right.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HIV</field><field name="subject">Tat</field><field name="subject">Epidemiologically-linked Cohort</field><field name="subject">PRMT6</field><field name="subject">Protein Stability</field><field name="subject">Transdominant Mutant</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178606</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mediated Electrochemistry of DMSO Reductase from Rhodobacter capsulatus</field><field name="creator">Kuan-i Chen</field><field name="description">A series of macrocyclic FeIII/II and CoIII/II transition metal complexes has been selected and tested to serve as artificial mediators in redox potentiometry of proteins and also in catalytic cyclic voltammetry of redox active enzymes. The potentials of these mediators ranges approximately from +200 mV to -600 mV vs the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) at pH 7, which spans the range of most redox active proteins. These coordination complexes are mostly stable in both the oxidized and the reduced forms and show pH-independent electrochemistry within the range 6 &lt; pH &lt; 9. A significant advantage of these mediators is to exhibit very weak visible absorption maxima which enable proteins with low extinction coefficients to be studied by optical potentiometry without spectral interference from the mediators. These mediators have been applied to the catalytic electrochemistry of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) reductase. DMSO reductase isolated from Rhodobacter capsulatus has been studied extensively in this work. It is an 82 kDa monomeric, soluble enzyme found in the periplasmic space of the organism where it is responsible for catalyzing the reduction of DMSO to dimethyl sulfide (DMS). DMSO is a rather inert and difficult to analyse compound, which appears in foods and beverages, such as wine, coffee, and tea. Enzyme based methods offer an effective way to detect DMSO in these samples. Rhodobacter capsulatus DMSO reductase contains only a single molybdenum cofactor which cycles between MoVI and MoIV during catalysis and provides a rare example of a Mo enzyme that has no other cofactors such as hemes, Fe-S clusters and flavins. Previous studies of direct (unmediated) electrocatalysis by DMSO reductase have shown only modest activity in comparison to that of other Mo enzymes. Mediated electrochemistry of DMSO reductase from Rhodobacter capsulatus using low-potential macrocyclic complexes such as [Co(trans-diammac)]3+, [Co(cis-diammac)]3+, or [Co(AMMEsar)]3+ as a mediator has been studied. The normal transient CoIII/II voltammetric response of the complex is converted into a sigmoidal (steady state) waveform in the presence of both DMSO and DMSO reductase. A single set of enzymatic rate and equilibrium constants has been determined through digital simulation (DigiSim) of the cyclic voltammetry performed under conditions where the scan rate, DMSO concentration, DMSO reductase concentration and mediator concentration were varied systematically. This information provides new insight to the kinetics of the DMSO reductase catalytic mechanism that has never before been obtained from steady state or stopped flow kinetics studies. Of note is that lowering the thermodynamic driving force by sequentially raising the redox potential of the mediator ([Co(trans-diammac)]3+ to [Co(cis-diammac)]3+ to [Co(AMMESar)]3+) slows the enzyme-mediator electron transfer reaction in accord with Marcus theory. Finally, preparation of enantiomerically pure sulfoxides by an electrochemical enzymatic system utilizing DMSO reductase from Rhodobacter capsulatus has also been investigated. This method has been performed using the coordination complex [Co(trans-diammac)]3+ as an electron donor during bulk electrocatalysis. The results indicate that DMSO reductase from R. capsulatus prefers to catalyze the reduction of both R-MPTSO (methyl p-tolyl sulfoxide) and R-MPSO (methyl phenyl sulfoxide) over their S-enantiomers. These results have been rationalized on the basis of the published crystal structure of DMSO reductase (R. capsulatus) with DMSO bound at the active site.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="subject">electrochemistry</field><field name="subject">Enzyme</field><field name="subject">Dmso Reductase</field><field name="subject">Mediators</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178609</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Feline immunodeficiency virus: molecular subtyping and evaluation of potential prognostic indicators</field><field name="creator">Rebecca Kann</field><field name="description">Abstract Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is an important infectious agent of domestic cats worldwide. It has been classified into the Lentivirus genus of the Retroviridae family, together with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Five FIV subtypes (A, B, C, D and E) have been described based on sequence variation of the V3-V5 region of the envelope (env) gene. There is considerable sequence diversity within and between subtypes, which has been a major obstacle in the development of a successful vaccine. However, an FIV vaccine that incorporates inactivated whole viruses from subtypes A and D is now commercially available. Although the vaccine has been shown to be efficacious in protecting against challenge with homologous and a heterologous (subtype B) subtypes, its effectiveness against other viral variants is unknown. Therefore, identifying the type and diversity of FIV strains in different regions is important to establish the potential efficacy of the vaccine in areas where vaccination is to be implemented. The proviral DNA sequence of the V3-V5 region of the env gene was determined for 102 FIV-infected cats from locations in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Subtype A was the predominant subtype in Australia and South Africa, although subtype B and C were also identified in each of these countries, respectively. Both subtypes A and C were also present in New Zealand. Of interest, there were some samples in New Zealand and South Africa that demonstrated subtype assignment discrepancies when different regions of the genome were analysed, suggesting co-infection and/or recombination. Cats infected with FIV exhibit varying degrees of immunological impairment. Currently, prognosis for an FIV-infected cat is based on clinical signs alone, which is a relatively subjective measure. In HIV-infected patients it is recognised that viral RNA load correlates with disease stage and prognosis. This PhD research tested whether viral RNA load may be a useful prognostic marker in FIV infection. A real-time PCR assay was developed to quantify plasma viral RNA load in 42 FIV-infected cats at three different clinical stages (1:healthy, 2:unwell without signs of immunodeficiency, 3:unwell with signs of immunodeficiency). In cats older than 5 years of age, log-transformed viral RNA loads were significantly higher in cats in category 3 compared to cats in category 1. There were no significant differences in the viral RNA load of older cats in category 2 compared to category 1. There were no cats younger than 5 years of age in category 3 and there was no significant difference in viral RNA load between young cats in categories 1 and 2. Of the 15 cats for which follow-up data was available, eight showed no change in clinical signs, and seven showed a worsening of clinical signs with six of these showing a progression of clinical category including death. One of the cats in category 2 that progressed clinically had one of the highest viral RNA loads of cats in that category. Three of four cats from category 3 that were followed had either died or been euthanised. Two of these cats had among the highest viral RNA loads in the whole study, while the remaining cat (for which the definitive cause of death was not confirmed) had a relatively low viral RNA load. In summary, measurement of viral RNA load was found to be a potentially useful clinical and prognostic marker but further work is required to better assess its usefulness to veterinarians. Serum acute phase proteins were investigated as possible candidate markers of FIV disease with the aim of developing a more simplified assay that could be used as a prognostic marker for FIV infection. Blood samples from 43 FIV-infected and 25 FIV-negative cats were assayed for the concentration of four acute phase proteins. Both healthy and sick cats were included in the study. Compared to healthy cats, sick cats had significantly higher concentrations of serum amyloid A (P&lt;0.05). Alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and haptoglobin were also found to be in higher concentrations in sick cats (P&lt;0.1). Other variables such as age and gender were also associated with acute phase protein concentrations. With respect to FIV infection, it was found that in sick cats, serum amyloid A, in combination with the age of the cat, was the best predictor of FIV viral RNA load. Alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and haptoglobin were not significantly associated with FIV viral RNA load. Although health status did not influence albumin levels, they were found to be significantly lower in FIV-positive cats in comparison to FIV-negative cats (P&lt;0.05). The frequent monitoring of viral RNA loads and CD4+ lymphocyte counts that is performed on HIV-infected patients is cost prohibitive in veterinary patients. This study showed that there is potential for the use of acute phase protein concentrations (in particular serum amyloid A) as alternative prognostic tools in FIV-infected cats. Further work, particularly longitudinal studies, is required to more definitively define changes in viral RNA load and acute phase protein concentrations throughout the course of FIV infection.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), subtyping/genotyping, env gene sequence, phylogenetic analysis, prognostic marker, real-time PCR, viral RNA load, acute phase proteins</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178610</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spaces of Ageing: the distinctive geographies of residential complexes</field><field name="creator">Maree Petersen</field><field name="description">Abstract Where and how people live in later life is of vital importance to their wellbeing. Yet there has been very little critical attention in gerontology to the growth of large residential complexes being built by developers on urban fringes across Australia. There is no coherent policy relating to older people&#8217;s accommodation, and a general absence in understanding the capacity of these purpose built environments to meet the needs of older people. Further, there is a lack of research that represents the intricate interplay of factors that informs the provision of residential complexes. This research aims to address the critical need to understand the reality of older people&#8217;s lives within these spaces of ageing. It seeks to do this by exploring the experiences and meaning older people resident in these complexes attach to these spaces, as well as investigating the views and knowledge of those responsible for their design and production. A spatial framework, directly informed by Henri Lefebvre&#8217;s theory of social space, provides a holistic means to integrate both the structural and humanistic dimensions of space. This framework guided an exploration of the working knowledge of the professionals involved in the production of residential complexes, as well as how older people use, and create meaning in this living environment. The qualitative research design facilitated the analysis of interviews with professionals and older people, as well as documents and working papers in order to gain a rich understanding of the different dimensions that make up the production of, and life within, residential complexes. The research identified a broad range of implications in relation to the policy and practice of building residential complexes for older people. Of particular note is that the working knowledge of those responsible for the provision of residential complexes is underpinned by a stereotypical approach to ageing which affects their attitudes and assumptions. This is part of a complex array of factors including ageism, the dominance of business acumen, and humanism all resulting in a cultural acceptance of older people&#8217;s accommodation as separate. These findings prompt consideration of who is planning for whom, and who benefits? Findings suggest that for older people residential complexes are an ambiguous place, characterised by tensions. For some residents, the space provides both security and community, enabling them to engage with occupations and relationships. However, for others, the space is limiting, compromising their ability to retain meaning in their lives. In this way, residential complexes are both an enabling and a constraining environment. These findings highlight the inherent difficulty of providing one dominant model for a population with a broad range of needs, experiences and expectations. Whatever their age older people continue to produce space, and this is not only about keeping the past alive, but keeping in touch with the whole of their lives. This entails continuing to form relationships and connecting to the environment, whether that is a garden, the bush or inner city life; and through the signification of objects as both an expression of connection, loss and absence. To reinforce the heterogeneity of older people, place and space for some was not important. This research has important implications for developing policy on ageing and planning the built environment, as well for the application of the theory of social space. Of note is the power and pervasiveness of ageism within professions responsible for the conception and production of residential complexes, and the strength of the dissonance between accommodation, support and care for older people. Important insights were gained about older people&#8217;s use and meaning of their space, notably the need to recognise micro agency and occupation throughout the life course. This thesis draws attention to the complexity of place and space in regard to older people and their living environments and challenges research that adopts a more singular approach. Finally, use of Lefebvre&#8217;s work to drive the approach adopted in this study is a major strength. In particular, the operationalisation of Lefebvre&#8217;s triad of social space in a social context provides a theoretical contribution to social theory, one to be taken up by gerontology and social science.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">older people, space, Lefebvre, residential complexes, housing policy, planning, ageism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178614</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anti-Sectarian Adult Education in Northern Ireland</field><field name="creator">Simone Smala</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an analysis of adult education programs concerned with reconciliation, and more specifically with reconciliation pedagogy used by community organisations in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland for many years was the site of inter-ethnic violence expressed through sectarian and paramilitary presence, but has moved towards a more peaceful, civil society in recent years. This thesis investigates how the role of the citizen-subject in the new Northern Ireland is constituted in adult education programs and how funding regimes govern such community relations initiatives. The thesis offers a critical analysis of interviews with tutors, participants, designers and managers involved in a selected peace and reconciliation course. A broader view on reconciliation pedagogy and curriculum in anti-sectarian adult education in Northern Ireland leads to a closer exploration of social practices and power relations surrounding the chosen course, while drawing upon selected aspects of social theory, Foucauldian discourse analysis and concepts of governmentality. The analysis revealed that the chosen anti-sectarian course, &#8216;Us and Them&#8217; (Workers Educational Association), proposes individualisation and responsibilisation as alternatives to community identities and nationalistic myths of origins. Equal rights are interpreted as equal rights to cultural expressions, and culture is continuously privileged over other structural differentials in Northern Ireland such as poverty, class or colour. &#8216;Us and Them&#8217; is one component of a large machinery of projects designed to address the conflict situation in Northern Ireland. This machinery finds its centre in the Northern Ireland Community Relations Council, which privileges certain knowledges based on cultural consociationalism over others and which distributes funds for peace and reconciliation projects accordingly. Furthermore,the thesis examines how contemporary policy papers addressing community relations shape discourses found in anti-sectarian strategies and the rationales, strategies and policies informing &#8220;Us and Them&#8217;. The aim of the analysis is to explore the power and potential (and the limitations) of individualisation and responsibilisation as techniques in peace and reconciliation pedagogy in post-settlement ethnic conflict situations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Education, adult education, ethnic conflict, governmentality, Northern Ireland, sectarianism, reconciliation, community relations, community relations policy, community relations funding</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178621</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stories from the Hidden Heart of &#8220;sacred violence&#8221;: An exploration of violence and Christian faith in East Timor in dialogue with Ren&#233; Girard's mimetic insight</field><field name="creator">Joel Hodge</field><field name="description">This dissertation explores how Christian faith affected the hope and resistance of an oppressed people in their response to violence orchestrated against them. It undertakes this task through stories collected from the people of East Timor, a half-island nation located in South-East Asia that was brutally ruled by Indonesia from 1975 to 1999. The nature of Christian faith is a vexed question for the modern world particularly when this faith has grown in countries like East Timor where suffering, violence and oppression were inflicted on the people. This lack of understanding of the nature and development of Christian faith is evident in academic studies of East Timor. Moreover, the difficult nature of this question is compounded by the fact that the violence and oppression, such as that inflicted on the East Timorese, is often orchestrated by the nation-state, which itself is a creation of the modern West. Faith in these circumstances of violence is often explained away as a circumstantial reaction after which the people will return to the path of reason. Yet, this attitude is problematic in the way it juxtaposes reason and faith. It ultimately exposes an unsound anthropological understanding of the human person as well as a view of reason that is narrow and insufficient as it sees reason as unable to cope with the circumstances of violence. This dissertation argues for an understanding of faith and violence through an analysis of the experiences of the East Timorese. This analysis is undertaken from an anthropological and theological understanding of the human person, primarily based on the insights of Ren&#233; Girard which provide clarity in understanding the relationship between human being, reason and faith. This dissertation argues that Christian faith helped the East Timorese people confront the existential and anthropological challenges posed by violence, and so, enabled them to overcome the illusions and false transcendence of violence, which Girard (1977, 31) says &#8220;&#8230;is the heart and secret soul of the sacred&#8221;. The dissertation shows that Christian faith helped form purpose, hope and non-violent resistance to state-sanctioned violence in East Timor through the anthropological, existential and imaginative resources fostered in relationship with Christ. The dissertation proposes an explanation of the experiences of the East Timorese recounted in this dissertation that posits that relationship with and faith in Christ, as the self-giving and victimised &#8220;Other&#8221;, had a discernible and plausible effect on the East Timorese particularly in the circumstances of violence. This faith commitment seemed to change and free persons and cultural structures in East Timor from the violent transcendence imposed by the dictatorial state that presents itself as &#8220;sacred&#8221;. This freedom emerged as the oppressed and victimised East Timorese, through their experience of the violent depths of human relations, were directed toward the pacific transcendence located around the victim, Christ, the substance of which is Christ&#8217;s self-giving love originating from and shared with the Father through the Spirit. East Timorese people were directed and responded to Christ in faith as they encountered the self-giving mimesis of the Trinity sacramentally and through the martyrs. This faith formed a new ontological way, or direction, which fostered resistance to the sacred violence of the state and their supporters. Through the enactment of their faith in this new and pacific way of being in self-giving mimesis, the Christian community in East Timor sought to resist and transform the state into a more benign and responsive entity by exposing and removing its ability to arbitrarily and indiscriminately victimise and oppress. This ecclesiological stance sought to expose the truth in the midst of the lies of sacred violence through a pacific way of being that was learnt from communion with the risen Christ as self-giving victim.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Girard</field><field name="subject">East Timor</field><field name="subject">Christian faith</field><field name="subject">Mimetic theory</field><field name="subject">theology</field><field name="subject">anthropology</field><field name="subject">violence</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178623</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tender risk and opportunity assessment practice in major construction alliances: a knowledge conversion process</field><field name="creator">Vuong Tu</field><field name="description">This research is an in-depth study concerning the practice of Risk and Opportunity (R&amp;O) assessment during the early phases of major project alliances in Australia. The particular focus is on how R&amp;Os are assessed and how the profile of R&amp;Os are set up and transferred during tender phases (from pre-tender, tender development, through to tender negotiation and construction start-up). The motivation for this research was that project risk assessments are reported to be inadequately assessed and ineffectively managed throughout the project life cycle in spite of the existence of well developed theories and procedures. However, little is known factually about how effectively R&amp;Os are actually assessed in practice during the early project phases, the factors that influence the risk assessment performance and the nature of the issues causing the deficiency of the tender risk assessment system. Although much has been written on the theoretical development of risk assessment systems, tools and techniques, very few studies have been conducted to discover empirically how both risks and opportunities are actually assessed during the tender phase in construction practice. These problems suggest that there is a need for in-depth studies of the practice of R&amp;O management, in order to better understand the fundamental nature of the issues that might be causing the reported ineffectiveness of current risk management practice as a basis for improvements. The researcher was immersed in the actual projects at critical stages in order to gain fine-grained access to investigate the issues &#8216;in situ.&#8217; Four major construction project alliances were selected for in-depth investigation, from amongst twenty large mining and construction projects considered in the course of this research. The research methodology used centred on participant observations and document analysis supported by interviews, discussions and mini-surveys to triangulate the findings. Data were gathered and analysed on how information and rapport associated knowledge of R&amp;Os were captured, converted and transferred during tender phases, from pre-tender, tender development, commercial negotiation up to construction start-up. Risk assessment systems, tools and techniques used during the tender phase in the projects studied were first examined and analysed. This revealed the R&amp;O assessment profile transfer process plus its variatious patterns, the associated practical problems and gaps in both theoretical models as well as practical implementation. The process and analysis were then interpreted and modelled using the four modes of the SECI (Socialisation-Externalisation-Combination-Internalisation) model developed in Organizational Knowledge Creation Theory (Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995). This provided a better understanding about the fundamental nature of the issues that might be causing the reported inadequacies of current practice. Implications of this knowledge conversion perspective for the adoption of risk assessment tools and techniques were identified. The major findings of this research are: (1) The R&amp;O assessment profile transfer across the tender phases described as an information transfer model, reveals that while considerable effort goes into formal R&amp;O documentation during the tender phase, there are a number of &#8220;breakdowns&#8221; in the assessment process. The two most critical issues are the disconnections between the quantitative assessment process and qualitative process, and a discontinuous process during hand-over from the tender phase to construction start-up phase; (2) These breakdowns can be explained when the R&amp;O assessment process is modelled as a knowledge conversion and transfer process rather than an information transfer process described in finding 1. The analysis reveals subsequent knowledge losses during the process and knowledge gaps between theory and practice. People, process and technology factors influencing tender risk assessment are also discussed; (3) Viewing R&amp;O assessment as a knowledge conversion process points to the need for the adoption of tools that can enhance the effectiveness of risk assessment through a knowledge elicitation, capture, communication and consolidation process; (4) The study proposes the SECI model as a suitable framework to better understand the nature of reported problems and reveals possible explanations for the deficiencies in the R&amp;O assessment systems observed in practice. These major thesis findings provide an alternative way of looking at risk assessment, shifting risk assessment from an information-based process to a knowledge conversion-based approach for a more sustainable and effective R&amp;O assessment system. Using the SECI model to describe risk and opportunity assessment processes as a knowledge conversion process has major implications for education and training in the practice of R&amp;O assessment. R&amp;O assessment becomes a learning process rather than a mere information passing process. Knowledge is revealed and captured and becomes internalised as an integral part of R&amp;O assessment. This helps to explain why attempts to capture &#8220;lessons learned&#8221; as a separate of conventional R&amp;O procedures frequently fail. Alliances and similar modes of project delivery that involve the collaboration of many stakeholders are likely to be used increasingly in construction, and it is essential we understand the ways in which information and knowledge of risks and opportunities are managed, especially in the early phases of major projects. Thus the new insights provided by these findings have significant implications for the formation and operation of risk and opportunity procedures in alliances and major projects more generally. Project alliance is recommended as a good procurement strategy that can enhance the effective transfer and use of knowledge about project uncertainties, thus assisting project organizations in achieving an effective risk management performance. Future research is needed to further explore the relationship between the characteristics of project alliances and the effectiveness of risk management over the whole project life cycle, with the support of the analysis framework from knowledge conversion process proposed in this thesis. Building on these findings, future research work is needed to understand how to effectively enhance the conversion of tacit knowledge about uncertainty into explicit knowledge. This will aid the development of a practical risk management framework across the whole project life cycle together with supporting risk assessment tools that utilize a knowledge-centered approach. The findings also point to the need for more research on the risk attitudes and related people factors, in the conduct of risk and opportunity assessments across the project life cycle.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Risk and opportunity assessment, construction project, tender, knowledge conversion</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178624</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Increases in corticospinal responsiveness during a sustained submaximal plantar flexion</field><field name="creator">Hoffman, Benjamin</field><field name="description">Studying the responsiveness of specific central nervous system (CNS) pathways to electrical or magnetic stimulation can provide important information regarding fatigue processes occurring as a result of ongoing muscle activity. While there are some studies assessing CNS responsiveness during sustained maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) few papers have examined such changes during sustained submaximal contractions, particularly in muscles of the lower limbs. The location of the underlying central fatigue process can be partially determined by assessing the responsiveness to magnetic or electrical stimulation at different sites along the CNS. This has been investigated during maximal and submaximal contractions in the upper limb muscles, however changes in corticospinal responsiveness at different CNS locations has yet to be determined during fatigue of lower limb muscles. Therefore, the focus of this study was to investigate changes in corticospinal responsiveness during a sustained submaximal contraction of the triceps surae. Comparisons were made between the size of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by motor cortical stimulation and cervicomedullary motor evoked potentials (CMEPs) elicited via magnetic stimulation of the descending tracts, in order to determine the site of any change in corticospinal responsiveness. Participants maintained an isometric contraction of triceps surae at 30% of MVC for as long as possible on two occasions. Stimulation was applied either to the motor cortex or to the cervicomedullary junction every minute during a contraction until task failure. Peripheral nerve stimulation was also applied to evoke maximal M-waves (Mmax) and a superimposed twitch. Additionally, MEPs and CMEPs were evoked during brief contractions at 80, 90 and 100% MVC as a non-fatigue control. During the sustained contractions, MEP size increased significantly in both soleus (113%; SOL) and medial gastrocnemius (108%; MG) and at endurance limit matched MEP size in the pre-fatigue MVC (&#8776;20-25% Mmax). In contrast, CMEP size increased significantly in MG (51%) but not in SOL (63%), and at endurance limit was significantly smaller than during pre-fatigue MVC (5-6% Mmax versus 11-13% Mmax). The data indicate that cortical processes contribute substantially to the increase in corticospinal responsiveness observed during sustained submaximal contraction of triceps surae. The strength of corticospinal projections and the upper-limit of motor unit recruitment may explain differences in corticospinal responsiveness between SOL and upper arm muscles. Furthermore, differences in motor unit recruitment and firing rate may explain differences in spinal responsiveness between submaximal and maximal voluntary contractions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TMS</field><field name="subject">CMEP</field><field name="subject">MEP</field><field name="subject">EMG</field><field name="subject">fatigue</field><field name="subject">isometric</field><field name="subject">human</field><field name="subject">M-wave</field><field name="subject">triceps surae</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178636</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustained Competitive Advantage of News Organisations: Research on the Human Resource Management on Taiwan&#8217;s Media Groups.</field><field name="creator">Pei-ying Tsai</field><field name="description">This research aims to investigate the extent to which media organisations in Taiwan apply human resource management strategies and policies to sustain their competitive advantage in a threatening environment. This study argues that human capital is the most valuable resource of media companies. As long as the human resource is optimally allocated and managed, it can facilitate media companies to outperform their competitors, and thus, enable media companies to achieve sustained competitive advantage. The first stage of this research analyses the Taiwanese media industry from a broad perspective. During the development of Taiwan&#8217;s media industry, the government and political parties played important roles. The key factors involved in the changes in the environment are examined from political, economic, social, and technological points of view. In addition, this research analyses the human resource management practices adopted by the two leading media groups in Taiwan. One of the groups is the United Daily News group, an old established media company with its interest in newspapers, and a newly established Eastern Broadcasting Corporation (EBC) group which is a multi-media company. Qualitative research approach was adopted as the framework for this research and also to explore and understand the links between specific human resource management indicators and media organisations&#8217; sustained competitive advantage. Two Taiwanese media groups were selected as case studies. The case study approach involved in-depth interviews conducted with management staff and non-management staff, in order to understand the two companies&#8217; human resource management policies and practices. Connecting the study as a whole, there are three important findings: (1) The deregulation which began from the late 1980s has transformed the Taiwanese media industry from a party-state domination to a fiercely competitive marketplace. (2) Consequently, Taiwanese news organisations have shown a greater propensity to pursue commercial performance. As such, in addition to journalists, advertising sales personnel were included in the talent pool by news organisations. (3) The view of human resources as a pool of capital implies a change in the perception of costs in media companies&#8217; human resource management practices. HRM is practised by the two companies in different degree. Taiwanese media companies should pay attention to the different characteristics of their core workers, and maintain their core workers to convey their organisational culture, and achieve their companies&#8217; SCA. In Taiwan, the HRM function had been ignored for a long time due to decades of regulation on new competitors. However, when the media proprietors spent a majority of their capital on the payroll and emphasized that &#8216;human capital&#8217; is their most important asset, to some extent, Taiwanese media companies perceived HRM as a means to achieve their companies&#8217; SCA. In this regard, Taiwanese media companies should make more effort to develop and nurture the HRM practices and policies which are suitable for the organisation&#8217;s unique culture, in improving the outcomes of their human resource investment and in turn providing sustained competitive advantage.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">400000 Journalism, Librarianship and Curatorial Studies</field><field name="subject">sustained competitive advantage</field><field name="subject">news organisations</field><field name="subject">human resource management</field><field name="subject">United Daily News group</field><field name="subject">Eastern Broadcasting Corporation</field><field name="subject">Taiwan</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178655</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women and power in Burmese history</field><field name="creator">Jessica Harriden</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the relationship between women and power in Burmese history, from the third century CE to the present day (2008), in order to identify the sources, nature and limitations of women&#8217;s power. In particular, the thesis aims to resolve the apparent contradiction that Burmese women historically enjoyed relatively &#8216;high&#8217; social status and economic influence, yet for the most part remained conspicuously absent from the public political arena. The author demonstrates that, while some women exercised significant political influence through their familial connections with powerful men, cultural models of &#8216;correct&#8217; female behaviour prevented most women from seeking official positions of political authority. The thesis considers how cultural and political influences &#8211; Buddhism, colonialism, nationalism and militarism &#8211; shaped Burmese concepts of gender and power, which relegated women to &#8216;traditional&#8217; subordinate, supporting political roles. The thesis also explores how the effects of prolonged armed conflict, economic isolation and political oppression have limited women&#8217;s ability to exercise power in military-ruled Burma. The author considers whether the pro-democracy movement and the recent focus on women&#8217;s issues and rights have opened up any new opportunities for women to exercise power both inside Burma and in exile. Finally, the thesis demonstrates that there is a need to critically re-examine traditional historical representations of Burmese women as passive objects with no political agency, both to highlight women&#8217;s use of informal power and to explain why so few women gained access to formal power.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Burma</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">power</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178726</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of three-dimensional imaging of ventricular structure and function on clinical decision-making</field><field name="creator">Jenkins, Carly</field><field name="description">Abstract Both qualitative and quantitative limitations of two-dimensional (2DE) imaging have lead to the emergence of the three-dimensional echo (3DE) technique. Until recently the development of 3DE technology has been slow due to inferior image quality and longer processing and acquisition times compared with 2DE. However, in recent times 3DE technology has advanced to &#8220;real-time&#8221; (RT3D) and has become feasible as a standard clinical tool. The overall hypothesis of the studies undertaken in this thesis is that the increased accuracy of left ventricular (LV) assessment using RT3D justifies its use in clinical decision-making based on both single and sequential measurements in routine echocardiographic practice. It shows the increased accuracy and feasibility of 3DE using online and offline techniques and opacification, and evaluates the prognostic implications of LV measurements globally and regionally using 3DE compared with 2DE. Further, it assesses the accuracy of LV assessment using 3DE and demonstrates its superior accuracy to 2DE in cross-sectional studies. The thesis initially reviews the use of physiologic parameters used for clinical decision making and looks at the principles of incremental value in diagnostic testing. The assessment of ventricular structure and function is discussed as well as the current problems with clinical echocardiography, which have lead to the evolution and development of 3DE. The second chapter describes the methodologies used in this thesis, with particular emphasis on new technologies used in the studies. Chapter 3 looks at the role of experience as a barrier to incorporation of 3DE into standard practice. We tested attendees before and after an intensive interactive training course to evaluate the learning curve. An interactive teaching course with rehearsal and direct mentoring appears to overcome this limitation and may improve the uptake of the 3DE technique. Chapters 4 to 6 validate the use of 3DE by comparing it to 2DE and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with respect to online and offline techniques, the use of left ventricular opacification (LVO) and the serial follow-up of patients. The availability of automated on-line software may increase the feasibility of real-time 3DE for LV volume calculation in clinical practice. Chapter 4 looks at the comparison of off- and on-line approaches with magnetic resonance imaging. Online measurement of LV volumes was found to be feasible and more accurate than with 2DE, however the offline approach was more accurate - although more time-consuming. Chapter 5 involves two studies which sought to validate 3DE in a multicentre setting. They examine the variability of LV measurements across multiple sites and to validate 3DE against MRI. The first study found that the semi-automated measurement of 3DE reduces the variation of LV volume between centers. The second study provides information on the role of different potential sources of error and provides guidelines for future users on how to minimize these errors as well as how to interpret their findings. The next chapter further validates 3DE with use of LVO as a technique to improve the accuracy of LV volume measurements. We sought to examine the accuracy of non-contrast and contrast enhanced 2DE and 3DE for calculation of LV volumes and ejection fraction (EF), relative to cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. 2DE with LVO was analogous to 3DE in accurate categorization of LV function. However, 3DE with LVO was feasible and superior to other non-contrast and contrast enhanced techniques in patients with previous infarction. Chapter 7 examines the technical details of regional volume measurements. The use of a fixed external frame of reference in analyses of regional wall motion in the apical four-chamber view is prone to a systematic error and the use of a floating-axis analysis corrects for this, but this is based on landmarks by MRI (apex, annulus) and center of mass by 3DE. The axis is likely to be influenced by reverse remodeling after intervention and therefore we sought to evaluate 3DE regional volume assessment vs. cardiac MRI over follow-up. The use of a center-line based on center of mass with RT3D may contribute to problems with use of this modality to track regional volumes over time. Although global 3DE volumes compare well with MRI volumes, new developments in image quality and automated software will be needed before changes in regional volumes can be reliably followed with 3DE. 2DE ESE is limited by sampling in standard imaging planes and suboptimal acquisition may cause poor matching of pre- and post-stress images. 3DE may avoid these orientation problems and contraction front mapping (CFM) may also provide a method for defining the temporal homogeneity of contraction. Chapter 8 examines the incremental benefit of 3DE CFM to 2DE and 3DE, using coronary angiography as the reference standard. It found that analysis of the temporal distribution of contraction may be an alternate means than 3DE wall motion assessment for identification of ischemia for ESE. Another significant validation needed for 3DE is not only for the LV but for the right ventricle (RV). The non-geometric nature of the RV makes it difficult to measure. Chapter 9 shows that 3DE is superior to 2DE for follow-up of RV function by validation vs. cardiac MRI. It was found that 3DE was indeed more accurate than 2DE approaches and reduces test-retest variation of RV volumes and EF measurements in follow-up RV assessment. Chapter 10 investigates the accuracy and reproducibility of the use of 3DE for serial follow-up of LV measurements. Echocardiographic follow-up of LV volumes is difficult because of the test-retest variation of 2DE. In this follow-up study, sequential 3DE measurements of change of volumes and EF were similar to those obtained using MRI, but 2DE overestimated change in EDV. As MRI is expensive, of limited availability and cannot be performed on patients with implanted devices, 3DE appears to be an effective long-term follow-up imaging tool for when sequential measurement of LV volumes is sought to guide management decisions. Chapter 11 investigates whether 3DE is more predictive of outcome than 2DE. In this outcome study, 3DE measurements of ESV and EF showed a stronger prediction of outcomes than 2DE. 3DE now appears to be the measurement of choice for when LV volumes and EF are sought to guide management decisions. In conclusion, the work reported in this thesis demonstrates that 3DE increases the accuracy of LV assessment and justifies its use in clinical decision-making based on both single and sequential measurements in routine echocardiographic practice.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1102 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology</field><field name="subject">Three-dimensional imaging</field><field name="subject">Ventricular Structure and Function</field><field name="subject">Clinical Decision-Making</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178730</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Article Omission and Overuse: Syntax and Semantics of the English Article System in Interlanguage Grammar</field><field name="creator">Jun Matoba</field><field name="description">This thesis examines ungrammatical article omission, and overuse of the definite article 'the' in indefinite specific context by Japanese learners of English. This is an area of English grammar that has been considered a major problem for L2 learners (e.g. Ionin, Ko &amp; Wexler, 2004; R. Hawkins et al., 2005, 2006; Trenkic, 2007). The thesis extends the analysis of Japanese learners' interlanguage to the overuse of 'a' in indefinite specific mass contexts by these learners. A detailed analysis of DP structures in Japanese and English leads to the conclusion that Japanese learners, through their L1, are equipped with the linguistic features which map onto articles in English, even though Japanese lacks articles. The thesis examines the syntactic role of articles in rendering predicative nouns argumental (e.g. Chierchia, 1998; Longobardi, 1994) and explores the definiteness contrast marked by 'the' as opposed to 'a/&#248;' with singular count nouns and mass nouns (e.g. J. Hawkins, 1978) at the semantic level. Count/mass distinctions are also examined in detail (e.g. Doetjes, 1997; Jackendoff, 1992) because the 'a' versus '&#216;' contrast clearly relates this distinction. This thesis argues that, despite its lack of articles, the Japanese grammar expresses definiteness and count/mass distinctions through its classifier system. For example, different orderings of the constituents in a classifier phrase induce different interpretations as to definiteness (e.g. Kakegawa, 2004). Further, the thesis shows that some classifiers are incompatible with mass nouns, thus argue that in Japanese, as in English, nouns are associated with the features which underlie the count/mass distinction. Thus, the difficulty that Japanese learners display in mastering the grammar of articles in English is attributed to difficulties in the mapping between their syntactic and semantic underlying knowledge and the surface forms (e.g. Lardiere, 1998) rather than to the need to acquire new features or categories of syntactic or semantic knowledge as the Representational Deficit Hypothesis (R. Hawkins, 2005) claims. This proposal differs from the previous studies that assume that the relevant syntactic category is not present in the learners&#8217; L1 thus not acquirable in the L2 (R. Hawkins et al., 2005; Trenkic, 2007). It also differs from those that suggest that, even when the learners&#8217; L1 does not overtly realize these features (Ionin et al., 2004), the semantic features are available through universal grammar (UG). In order to examine how Japanese learners map syntactic and semantic knowledge onto the surface forms of articles in their English, data were collected via an oral production task and two types of grammaticality judgment tasks. An online judgment task was used to gather evidence for an intuitive type of knowledge of the constraints on article use, while an offline judgment task examined conscious metalinguistic knowledge of articles. Because L2 learners tend to construct and apply various metalinguistic rules as to the use of articles (Goto-Butler, 2002), the examination of both intuitive and conscious knowledge is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the development of the article system in interlanguage grammar. For the mapping of the syntactic knowledge of articles, the omission of articles by Japanese participants is investigated. The investigation focused on singular count nouns because the omission of articles with these nouns is ungrammatical in any context. It was observed that several of the Japanese participants indeed disallowed article omission for these nouns, suggesting that they had acquired the English system of mapping relevant syntactic knowledge onto the surface forms of articles. The thesis also explores the mapping of the semantic knowledge of articles by focusing on the overuse of 'the' in indefinite specific contexts. Previous studies have claimed that the overuse of 'the' is governed by the Article Choice Parameter (Ionin et al., 2004). The findings reported here confirm the tendency to overuse 'the' in indefinite specific (i.e. noteworthy (Ionin et al., 2004)) contexts. However, it was also observed that 'a' was judged acceptable in the same context. The offline grammaticality judgment task revealed that the choice of 'the' in this context may have been affected by metalinguistic knowledge. Thus, the findings are not in agreement with the hypothesis that a parameter governs the overuse of 'the' in indefinite specific contexts. Additionally, the thesis examines the overuse of 'a' in mass contexts. Though small in number, the participants who make inconsistent judgments for the same noun showed a tendency to accept the use of 'a' in specific contexts (i.e. de re specific) and reject it in non-specific contexts. It is argued that the feature [+specific] may be mapped onto 'a' in mass contexts in these learners&#8217; grammar. Based on these findings, the thesis explores how the syntactic module and the semantic module interact with each other in L2 grammar when mapping linguistic knowledge onto surface forms. The thesis also explores the effect of metalinguistic knowledge on L2 learners&#8217; grammaticality judgments in order to demonstrate a more comprehensive picture of article systems in interlanguage grammar.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English articles, definiteness, count/mass distinctions, interlanguage grammar, metalinguistic</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178731</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Imagining the Bugfolk: Insects and Anthropomorphism in Popular Culture</field><field name="creator">Adam Dodd</field><field name="description">Anthropomorphic portrayals of insects in popular culture reflect ongoing debates and uncertainties about the nature of human beings and their place within the environment. This thesis examines anthropomorphic portrayals of insects in popular media from the early nineteenth century to the present day. It shows how the codes of anthropomorphic representation that developed in conjunction with popular microscopy during the nineteenth century have continued to shape the portrayal of insects in popular culture. Nineteenth-century books about insects refined a literary style conducive to the description of settings and events existing outside the normal perceptual parameters of the reader. The popularity and descriptive limits of this style, along with advances in printing methods and photography, led to an increase in production and distribution of insect imagery. The public fascination with insect imagery inspired many cinematic portrayals of insects that, continuing into the twentieth century, advanced the codes of anthropomorphism already established by preceding texts. Central to these anthropomorphic portrayals is the &#8216;otherworldly&#8217; status of the insect, a status ensured by its location in the so-called &#8216;insect world.&#8217; Hence, insects have come to inspire a range of otherworldly beings, from the nineteenth-century fairy to contemporary representations of extraterrestrial beings. The popularity of these figures, in turn, has shaped conceptions of insects themselves. Studying these figures provides an opportunity to better understand how human-insect relations are shaped by culture, and thus to interrogate how human identity itself arises from, and is guided by, cultural practices that seek to engage with the natural world. By foregrounding the ways in which the insect has come to represent the otherworldly and the imaginal, it becomes possible to begin to alleviate psychological barriers to ecological realities, and in particular, the ecological reality of the insect&#8217;s place as the most biologically prolific species on Earth.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">insects, anthropomorphism, popular culture, visual media, entomology, microscopy, cinema, aliens, fairies</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178733</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Morphogenesis of testis cords</field><field name="creator">Alexander Combes</field><field name="description">To date, studies into sex determination and gonadal development have focused on the regulatory mechanisms governing development of the male or female phenotype. However, the formation of the testis and ovary from the bipotential gonad also present a fascinating model of tissue organisation which has been largely overlooked. When seeking to understand tissue organisation during gonadal development, the formation of testis cords takes center stage. However, despite a growing understanding of the cellular events in testis development, a number of key questions about the formation of testis cords remain unanswered. Specifically, I aimed to investigate the role of cell migration in testis organization, and the structure and morphogenesis of testis cords in three dimensions. To address these aims experimentally, I investigated the early morphogenesis of testis cords and the dependence of cord formation on cell migration from the mesonephros. I found that virtually all of the migrating cells express endothelial markers, indicating that endothelial, not peritubular myoid cells underlie the dependence of cord formation on cell migration. Further, disruption of endothelial cell migration and vascular organisation using a blocking antibody to VE-cadherin, also disrupted the development of testis cords. These data reveal that migrating endothelial cells are required for testis cord formation, consistent with increasing evidence of a broader role for vasculature in establishing tissue architecture during organogenesis. To address the question of cord structure and morphogenesis, I developed and applied a novel fluorescence-based three-dimensional modeling approach to show that Sertoli cells coalesce into irregular groups surrounding germ cells, and that these groups are remodeled to form highly regular toroidal loops, joined by a flattened plexus at the dorsal side. This plexus is punctured by blood vessels as they ingress from the mesonephros, and contracts during maturation to form part of the rete testis. Variation in cord number and position demonstrates that cord establishment is not a stereotypic process. However, a tightly regulated modeling mechanism must contribute to uniformity on cord diameter and orientation as these parameters remain consistent across samples of the same age. These data clarify questions of cord structure and organisation, establish that cord formation is a variable process, and demonstrate novel structural features within the network of testis cords. Finally, to investigate an in vivo model where vascularisation and cord formation may be disrupted, I analysed gonads from embryos lacking Cited2. Consistent with a previous study, I found that testis development was delayed in Cited2-/- gonads, but found that despite the reported transcriptional recovery after the delay, testis vascular and cord structure was permanently disrupted. To investigate the defects in cord formation I assayed cell migration and found that migration was not disrupted in XY gonads, or mesonephroi lacking Cited2. However, ectopic cell migration was observed in the XX gonad in a dose-dependent response to loss of functional Cited2 alleles. Correspondingly, the female pathway was initially delayed but rallied for a late recovery, implicating Sf1 in the initiation of ovarian differentiation. These data underscore the fragility of the molecular control of sex determination as absence of Cited2 in the male permanently disrupts testis morphology, whereas in the female, promoters of the male pathway are not sufficiently suppressed. From these studies I construct an integrated model of testis cord formation and conclude that testis cord formation is a novel form of tubulogenesis. This morphogenesis is unique and offers insights into cell and tissue organisation, vascular interactions in organogenesis, and mechanisms of tube formation. Further study of cord formation is likely to lead to a broader understanding of tissue morphogenesis during development.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Testis Development</field><field name="subject">Organogenesis</field><field name="subject">Testis cord</field><field name="subject">Vasculature</field><field name="subject">Imaging</field><field name="subject">Cell migration</field><field name="subject">3D Modelling</field><field name="subject">SF1</field><field name="subject">Cited2</field><field name="subject">Morphogenesis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178736</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unravelling the role of the bacterial cell division protein DivIB</field><field name="creator">Kimberly Wadsworth</field><field name="description">The molecular mechanics of bacterial cell division remain one of the most fundamental unsolved problems in bacterial cell biology. During bacterial cytokinesis, bacteria divide symmetrically to give rise to two identical daughter cells. This tightly regulated process is orchestrated by an assembly of essential cell division proteins that form a supramolecular structure known as the divisome. The divisome, which forms at the cell centre, is responsible for the invagination and fusion of the cell&#8217;s membrane and peptidoglycan layers. The Escherichia coli divisome is comprised of at least ten essential proteins whose individual functions are mostly unknown. These divisomal proteins are recruited in a semi-hierarchical order, with the early recruits being predominantly cytoplasmic and the later recruits being predominantly extracytoplasmic or multi-pass transmembrane proteins. DivIB and its ortholog FtsQ are essential members of the divisome in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. DivIB is a bitopic membrane protein composed of an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a single-pass transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal extracytoplasmic region comprised of three separate protein domains. The &#945; domain is located next to the transmembrane segment and is a polypeptide-transport-associated (POTRA) domain. The &#946; domain comprises approximately half of the extracytoplasmic region, and has a unique three-dimensional fold. The most C-terminal domain, the &#947; domain, is relatively unstructured. This protein has been proposed to play a role in septal peptidoglycan cross-linking or lengthening. The primary aims of these studies were to further characterise the structure and function of the bacterial cell division protein DivIB as well as investigate the interactions this protein has with the other divisomal proteins. It was anticipated that the knowledge gained should aid in the development of antimicrobials that target this protein&#8217;s function or protein-protein interactions. A molecular dissection approach was used to determine which of DivIB&#8217;s domains are essential for its recruitment to incipient division sites and for its cell division functions. It was determined that DivIB has three molecular epitopes that mediate its localisation to division septa; two epitopes are encoded within the extracytoplasmic region while the third is located in the transmembrane domain. It is proposed that these epitopes represent sites of interaction with other divisomal proteins, and this information was used to develop a model of the way in which DivIB and FtsQ are integrated into the divisome. Remarkably, two of the three DivIB localisation epitopes are dispensable for vegetative cell division; this suggests that the divisome is assembled using a complex network of protein-protein interactions, many of which are redundant and likely to be individually nonessential. Yeast and bacterial two-hybrid studies have revealed that most of these proteins have multiple binding partners, making it difficult to pinpoint epitopes that mediate the interaction between pairs of interacting proteins. Recently, a heterologous septal targeting approach was introduced to study the interaction between Bacillus subtilis divisomal proteins in E. coli. This technique allows the interaction between pairs of divisomal proteins to be studied in vivo without the complications caused by other interacting proteins. This approach was used to perform a molecular dissection of the interaction between B. subtilis DivIB and the divisomal transpeptidase PBP 2B. Although both proteins have septal localisation determinants in their transmembrane domains, it was found that these regions do not mediate their interaction. Rather, it was shown that DivIB interacts with PBP 2B through its extracytoplasmic region. Dissection studies revealed that all three extracytoplasmic domains of DivIB are necessary for interaction with PBP 2B, suggesting that the two proteins make multiple interactions, each of which is not strong enough in isolation to mediate formation of a stable complex. Finally, it was shown that E. coli FtsQ localises to the division septum in B. subtilis but cannot complement a divIB null. Multi-angle laser light scattering (MALLS) analysis revealed that the extracytoplasmic domain of Geobacillus stearothermophilus DivIB is predominantly monomeric at high concentrations. This indicated that if DivIB does exist as a dimer in vivo, it dimerises through its cytoplasmic or transmembrane region. In vitro observations suggest the C-terminal residues of DivIB may play a role in peptidoglycan binding. Finally, attempts were made to determine the three-dimensional structure of the complete extracytoplasmic domain of DivIB. Although it proved impossible to determine the structure using NMR spectroscopy, crystals were obtained under many different crystallisation conditions. Despite diffracting to 3.5 &#197;, we were unable to solve the protein structure using X-ray crystallography. However, this work has laid the groundwork for future attempts at solving the structure of this protein using X-ray crystallography.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bacillus subtilis</field><field name="subject">DivIB</field><field name="subject">Escherichia coli</field><field name="subject">FtsQ</field><field name="subject">cell division</field><field name="subject">cytokinesis</field><field name="subject">divisome</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178741</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MobileMums: a physical activity intervention delivered via SMS for disadvantaged postnatal women</field><field name="creator">Brianna S Fjeldsoe</field><field name="description">Abstract The role of regular physical activity for preventing ill health and chronic disease is well established. Despite the demonstrated role of physical activity for the prevention of ill health, population participation levels among adults remain at stable but unfavourably low levels. Evidence suggests that postnatal women (&lt;12-months postpartum) living in disadvantaged communities are at particular risk of low physical activity participation, even though there are additional physical and mental health benefits of physical activity in the postpartum period. There is a need to develop effective physical activity interventions for postnatal women living in disadvantaged communities. Traditional physical activity interventions are often designed and implemented in ways that exclude disadvantaged groups. Unlike other methods of communication typically used to disseminate mass-reach interventions (e.g., internet, e-mail), mobile telephone short messaging service (SMS) is used equally by disadvantaged and advantaged groups. Few SMS-delivered health behaviour interventions have targeted preventive health behaviours, such as physical activity. The primary aim of this research was to evaluate the efficacy of an individually-tailored physical activity intervention delivered via SMS (&#8220;MobileMums&#8221;) for postnatal women living in a disadvantaged community. A secondary aim of this research was to explore the role of theory-derived mediators of physical activity behaviour change that were targeted in the intervention. A physical activity intervention was developed based on findings from formative focus groups conducted with postnatal women (n=48) and a pilot study of intervention procedures and content (n=12). This formative research highlighted the need for flexible delivery of a physical activity intervention for postnatal women and identified mobile telephone SMS as a highly used form of communication. Women indicated a willingness to receive health-related messages via their mobile telephones and reported a physical activity preference for walking. The 12-week intervention was delivered primarily via personally tailored SMS and aimed to increase health-enhancing physical activity (HEPA) and more specifically Walking for Exercise. The SMS targeted constructs of the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) (self efficacy, outcome expectancy, goal setting skills, social support and perceived environmental opportunity for exercise). Overall, the intervention employed practical strategies to help participants develop skills in physical activity goal setting and social support negotiations, and promoted local opportunities for physical activity. The intervention was evaluated in a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) involving 88 postnatal women. Data were collected at baseline, 6-weeks and 13-weeks. At each data collection point, HEPA was assessed using ActiGraph accelerometers and self-report measures. Walking for Exercise was assessed in the self-report measure. Validated self-report measures of the targeted SCT constructs were also administered at each data collection point. Following the RCT, intervention group participants were invited to participate in a one-on-one qualitative interview to explore their perceptions of the intervention. The intention-to-treat analysis of HEPA outcomes revealed significant group x time interaction effects for change in HEPA frequency (days per week) using both MTI-recorded (F(2,44)=9.17, p&lt;0.001) and self-reported outcomes (F(2,85)=7.15, p=0.001). Intervention group participants increased MTI-recorded HEPA frequency (mean change 1.46 days/wk, SD&#177; 2.16) and self-reported HEPA frequency (mean change 1.67 days/wk, SD&#177; 1.71) from baseline to 13-weeks. There was no significant effect on HEPA duration (minutes per week) as a result of the intervention for either MTI-recorded or self-reported outcomes. Self-reported Walking for Exercise frequency had a significant between-group effect (F(1,86)=5.02, p=0.03) and within-group effect (F(2,85)=8.60, p&lt;0.001) but there was no significant group x time interaction. There were significantly more intervention group participants than control group participants meeting the HEPA guidelines at 6-weeks (86% vs. 37%, &#967;2=10.25, p=0.001) and at 13-weeks (54% vs. 19%, &#967;2=5.18, p=0.04). There were significant group x time interaction effects for change in self efficacy (F(2,85)=3.69, p=0.03) and goal setting skills (F(2,85)=4.28, p=0.01) from baseline to 13-weeks. Based on the Baron and Kenny criteria for mediation, changes in self efficacy and goal setting skills mediated the significant intervention effect on change in HEPA frequency over the first 6-weeks of the intervention. None of the SCT constructs mediated the significant intervention effect on change in HEPA frequency during the second 6-weeks of the intervention. There was a generally positive response to the intervention from participants. Results from qualitative interviews showed that intervention group participants believed the intervention helped them to initiate physical activity, and that it was motivating and &#8216;mother-centred&#8217;. At 13-weeks, more intervention group participants (51%) rated the intervention program as &#8216;extremely useful&#8217; or &#8216;useful&#8217; than at 6-weeks (44%). Overall, the intervention developed as part of this research resulted in increases in HEPA among postnatal women, which were mediated in the short-term by changes in targeted SCT constructs. This study is an innovative extension of previous research investigating strategies to promote physical activity among postnatal women. The findings provide evidence to support further inter-disciplinary collaborations between researchers in physical activity (and other areas of health behaviour change) and information technology. This research contributes foundation knowledge to the emerging research area of SMS-delivered health behaviour change interventions and the potential for systematic population-wide delivery via an existing low-cost technology.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">physical activity</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">Mother</field><field name="subject">intervention</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">Social Cognitive Theory</field><field name="subject">exercise</field><field name="subject">Walking</field><field name="subject">mobile telephone</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178752</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance management, organisational commitment, and Employee outcomes: A case in Thai policing</field><field name="creator">Songaek Patcharawit</field><field name="description">Performance management is a holistic approach to organisational improvement that integrates individual and organisational goals and fosters cooperation between supervisors and employees to develop a shared understanding of work expectations. The literature further clarifies a performance management system as having four practices &#8211; goal setting, performance appraisal, employee development, and rewards. The conceptualisation of performance management draws on the dominant HRM framework of bundles of &#8220;high commitment&#8221; work practices whereby an organisation involves employees in its goals and activities to promote their discretionary motivation towards desired outcomes and overall improvement. However, there has been limited research on fully theorising performance management with the four key components. Although some empirical studies have tested the performance management concept, they focus narrowly on only a few of these components. Moreover, empirical research has omitted the role of organisational commitment in explaining the commitment based mechanisms in which the performance management bundle operates to inspire employees to improve their contributions in a workplace. To address these gaps, this study proposes a conceptual model to empirically investigate the linkages between performance management and three employee outcomes of task performance, organisational citizenship behaviour (OCB), and turnover intention as mediated by two focal bases of organisational commitment &#8211; affective and continuance dimensions. These relationships are explored in the Thai Police Service. The mediating effects are based on the argument that satisfactory work conditions inherent in performance management may carry perceptions of both organisational care and support and also accumulated investments underlying the development of the affective and continuance dimensions, respectively. While both mediators are hypothesised to decrease turnover, affective commitment tends to increase task performance and OCB, and continuance commitment tends to be either unrelated or negatively related to both performance variables. Furthermore, because organisational characteristics in police forces are generally distinct from others, police culture was included in the conceptual model to examine the incremental contribution of performance management to changes in the employee outcomes. This research embraced three related studies. Four focus groups of 27 patrol officers were conducted in Study 1 to explore key dimensions of police culture and examine officers&#8217; understanding of performance management practices. Having developed a written questionnaire to test the conceptual model, Study 2 surveyed 161 patrol officers returning 152 usable questionnaires in order to assess the meaning equivalence and applicability of the translated measures of all constructs (from English to Thai) in the model, and to determine their validity and reliability. In the third and main study, a revised questionnaire was used to survey 516 patrol officers, 454 of which returned usable questionnaires that were half split randomly (224 and 230) to enable the analysis in two parts. Based on structural equation modeling (SEM), the first part allowed the measurement properties to be re-explored due to questionnaire revisions, and then confirmed, using both respective samples. The second part was based on the Partial Least Squares (PLS) technique for testing the conceptual model using the second sample. Overall, the empirical analysis shows that performance management not only accounted for affective commitment but also, to a lesser extent, continuance commitment. Performance management also was related both directly with task performance and indirectly through affective commitment, only directly with OCB, and only indirectly (fully mediated) with turnover intention through continuance commitment. Even after controlling for the impact of police culture and demographic characteristics, the predictive strength of performance management remained significant. The hypothesized relationships of affective commitment to OCB and turnover, however, were not supported. The follow up analysis revealed that the positive relationship between the former actually existed, but was conditional upon a high level of continuance commitment. Some of the major theoretical implications include the conceptualisation of performance management as confirmed with four components, a better understanding of the role of organisational commitment in explicating the high commitment mechanisms of performance management and the impact of organisational culture on the operation of performance management. From a practical perspective, organisations are encouraged to establish the holistic process of performance management to elevate employee performance and overall productivity and to emphasise voluntary and supportive aspects of the implementation of performance management to ensure its positive effects through affective rather than continuance commitment. For police organisations particularly, management should strive for interventions that reinforce values of progressive thinking, people-centred operations, and cooperation to supplement the performance management system. Finally, the conclusion discusses limitations and directions for future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">performance management, organisational commitment, employee outcomes, police culture, SEM, and PLS</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178784</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical, structural, and social aspects of activity engagement and conduct disorders in young Australian children</field><field name="creator">Mong-lin Yu</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT Conduct problems are a common childhood mental health problem representing a significant proportion of young clients referred for occupational therapy. Children with conduct problems, especially the early onset subtype, can experience a difficult developmental trajectory and this can also impact family members, peers and the broader community. The contours of family life in Australia, and many other western countries, have changed dramatically over the last few decades. For example, we have witnessed a large increase in single parent households, a dramatic increase in maternal employment, declines in fertility rates to well below replacement level, delayed parenthood, and an increase in divorce rates. Consequently both parents and children must navigate a much more varied and in some cases more challenging and stressful set of life course choices and pathways than in the past. For some this will result in changes to parenting practices and children&#8217;s time use, potentially exposing children to a higher risk for developing conduct problems. While there is evidence to support the important role played by parents in this context, the relative impact of how and with whom children spend their time has not been closely examined. The aims of this study are to understand how young Australian children spend their time and to examine how children&#8217;s time use is related to their risk of developing conduct problems. More specifically it aims to investigate the social context of activities in which children are involved, the extent to which these activities involve physical exertion, structure, and rest and recuperative qualities in relation to conduct problems. In addition, children&#8217;s exposure to out-of-family care, differences in parenting practices and socioeconomic factors are also considered. The study is unique in having access to recent, high quality, national level Australian survey data that combines both detailed information on children&#8217;s time use, validated scales measuring children&#8217;s conduct problems, as well as a range of other variables necessary to accurately measure the relationships between them. These data come from the 4 to 5 year old child cohort from Wave 1 of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC) survey. The LSAC is the first comprehensive national longitudinal study of Australian children and is funded by the Australian Government Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA). The LSAC follows the lives of two cohorts of approximately 5,000 children each, an infant cohort (0-1 years old in Wave 1) and a child cohort (4-5 years old in Wave 1). This study examines the 4-5 year cohort only. A key strength of the LSAC is its use of time diaries to collect detailed information on children&#8217;s time use. It is the analyses of data from these diaries that is unique to the current study of conduct problems and allows the presentation of the first results that combine detailed measures of children&#8217;s time use with conduct disorder outcomes. First, descriptive analyses reveal the prevalence of children at risk of developing conduct problems, the variety of parenting practices and children&#8217;s time use profiles. Approximately 29% of Australian children aged 4 to 5 years are identified as being &#8220;at risk&#8221; of conduct problems. Parenting practices for children demonstrate high levels of warmth, reasoning, consistency, and low hostility. Children are reported to experience adequate amounts of sleep or rest, on average 11 hours per day. Over a quarter of children do not engage in moderate to vigorous physical activities, particularly on weekdays, over half do not engage in structured activities on weekdays and well over three-quarters do not engage in structured activities on weekends. Children are highly supervised by adults for approximately 10 hours a day either with or without the presence of peers during their waking hours, whereas almost three quarters of children do not spend time alone and over a half do not spend time with peers only. Second, two-way ANOVAs and random effects models are used to compare children&#8217;s time use by their experience of conduct problems. Results derived from the two-way ANOVAs indicate that children at risk of conduct problems spend significantly fewer hours being restful on weekdays, significantly more hours without peers under adult supervision on weekends and significantly fewer hours with peers under adult supervision on weekends than those not at risk. Results from the random effects models show that children at risk of developing conduct problems spend significantly more hours bike riding and significantly fewer hours being restful than those not at risk. Overall these results suggest that children at risk of conduct problems used time differently from those not at risk, particularly those aspects of time which are restful, involve bike riding, and in supervised social contexts. Third, chi-square tests and univariate logistic regression both affirm a higher risk of boys developing conduct problems (1.31 times more likely) than girls. Multivariate logistic regression with random effects is used to model the risk for developing conduct problems for boys and girls. The female model indicates that girls are at lower risk of conduct problems only if they are exposed to consistent and less hostile parenting practice and not have sleep problem reported by parents. The male model suggests that boys are vulnerable to more risk factors and are at lower risk of developing conduct problems if they have fathers who have completed tertiary education, are exposed to consistent and less hostile parenting, do not ride a bike on weekdays, spend less time in exercise on weekends, and do not have sleep problem reported by parents. Overall, the findings of this thesis lead to three main conclusions. First, males are at heightened risk for developing conduct problems and are subjected to more risk factors than girls. Second, parenting practice is affirmed in this thesis as the paramount predictor of risk for 4 to 5 year old children developing conduct problems. Third, the effects of time use depending on the innate quality and structure of activity are considered important for young children&#8217;s risk of developing conduct problems, and this is particularly pertinent for young boys. These results support the importance of family-centred services and time arrangements for activity participation when working with children at risk of or diagnosed with conduct problems. It also affirms the necessity to attend to parenting practices which may be described as hostile and inconsistent while at the same time highlighting the importance of fathers to their sons risk profile. These findings contribute to our understanding of children&#8217;s time use as a contributor to the behavioural wellbeing of children, especially young boys.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">time use</field><field name="subject">activity participation</field><field name="subject">conduct problems</field><field name="subject">parenting practices</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178785</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Why employees work extended working hours: A discourse study</field><field name="creator">Neal Waddell</field><field name="description">The expectation that employees of large organisations will work extended working hours (EWH) is a phenomenon of discourse at the societal and organisational levels. This occurs in spite of the detrimental effects that working long hours can have on employees&#8217; mental and physical health and the well-being of their families. This thesis investigates why employees comply with this expectation by focussing on managers and professionals because they are the categories of Australian employees who work the longest hours. Texts derived from a focus group and extended interviews of 30 managers and professionals are analysed and interpreted using a computer-assisted text analysis program, linguistic analysis, and discourse linguistic interpretation. Of particular emphasis is the deontic modality that research participants use to express their obligation to expectation and their attitudes about other organisational imperatives. Also crucial to this research is the agency of the participants in terms of their capacity to make and follow their own decisions. This investigation is informed by critical post-structuralist theory of Foucaultian origin involving a pragmatic distinction between analysis for meaning potential at the text level and context for meaning at the discourse level. This empirical research found that participants commonly feel cognitive dissonance from the contradiction that EWH and work-life balance (WLB) co-exist in their same organisational discourse. This paradox complicates their responses to expectation whether the participants comply or resist. Participants&#8217; agency is therefore judged on their level of reflexivity to these organisational challenges. The professional cohort was found to be more reflexive and thus agentically stronger because their work paths are clearer. They know what work is required and, even though their working hours may be long, they see them purely as the means to achieving prescribed ends. Public sector managers&#8217; work is also extensive but they do not have clear boundaries and thus find the boundaries between work and nonwork non-existent or blurred. Financial service managers are more agentic than public sector managers but less than the professionals. The women in this research relate to work time and life balance differently and less easily than men, particularly those who break for motherhood and / or work part-time. The theory built in this thesis can inform organisations of the ubiquitous presence of the expectation of EWH and the dangers it provides for employees and organisations. It also provides practice guidance to organisations as to how EWH may be common but do not necessarily benefit organisations or their employees. This thesis finds that it is more sensible to support employees&#8217; agency by acknowledging their diversity and giving them choice in determining for how long they should work. This would allow employees to identify and experience obligation to their organisation and their part in negotiated knowledge production.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">extended working hours, discourse, expectation, obligation, work-life balance, agency, Leximancer, qualitative research, managers, professionals</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178792</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integron-associated antimicrobial resistance in Australian beef cattle</field><field name="creator">Robert Barlow</field><field name="description">A consequence of antimicrobial use in food production systems is the potential for antimicrobial resistant (AMR) bacteria to develop and transfer to the human population via the food chain. Integrons have been identified as critical factors in the development of AMR. Despite Australia being amongst the world&#8217;s largest exporters of beef, there is a general lack of data on the prevalence of AMR in bacteria from Australian beef cattle. Consequently, the aim of this study has been to contribute to research strategies and knowledge of AMR by investigating integron-associated antimicrobial resistance in Australian beef cattle production systems. This study developed a protocol that targets resistance integrons. The protocol was trialled on 50 bovine faecal samples with a total of 39 integron-containing isolates recovered. Characterisation of the integrons was performed and it was determined that the majority of integrons harboured genes encoding resistance to trimethoprim (dfr) and streptomycin / spectinomycin (aad). The protocol provides an opportunity to rapidly interrogate populations of bacteria within a defined sample for resistance integrons. The protocol was used to investigate integron-associated AMR in Australian beef cattle production systems. Each production system was investigated for resistance integrons to determine if production practices were impacting on the prevalence and types of AMR present. The investigation found that the prevalence of integron-containing bacteria was higher in lot-fed cattle than grass-fed cattle which in turn were higher than organically produced cattle. However, the types of AMR differed very little across production systems and suggested that the higher prevalence of integrons in lot-fed samples may be a function of the intensive nature of this type of production system rather than a result of selective pressure caused by antibiotic use. Although there appeared to be no obvious trends in the types of gene cassettes carried by integrons from differing production systems, if lot-fed cattle continually arrive at slaughter with a higher prevalence of integron-containing bacteria then these cattle may be more likely to contribute to contamination of the final product. Samples from lot-fed, grass-fed and organically produced cattle at slaughter were collected. Despite the apparent unrelatedness of the cattle herds, there was little difference in the PCR prevalence of class 1 and class 2 integrase, the gene cassettes harboured by the integrons, and the host organism for the integron. Genes encoding resistance to streptomycin and chloramphenicol (catB8) dominated the majority of arrays regardless of production system, although two novel arrays were identified. One of the arrays, cmlA5-blaoxa-10-aadA1, was found in A. veronii biovar Sobria isolates from organic cattle thereby confirming the ability of multi-resistant integrons to persist in environments that have no obvious antimicrobial selection. The abattoir study revealed an unusually high prevalence of Aeromonas isolates carrying integrons. It appeared to implicate the abattoir environment as a direct contributor to the presence of integron-containing bacteria in each herd. Characterisation of each Aeromonas isolate determined that the isolates were not clonal in nature and not a result of persistent contamination at the abattoir. It seemed more probable that the Aeromonas isolates were present in the cattle prior to arrival and may have been acquired from the environment. To explore this further, soil samples from cattle associated and non-cattle associated areas were tested for the presence of resistance integrons. The prevalence of class 1 integrons was higher in cattle-associated soil samples than in non-cattle-associated soil samples, however the diversity of gene cassettes harboured by the integrons was greater in non-cattle-associated samples than cattle-associated samples. An array harbouring blaoxa-30 was isolated from a non-cattle-associated soil sample. Its presence continues to highlight the potential for multi-resistant integrons to exist in environments with no obvious antimicrobial selection pressure.The detection of seldom reported class 1 integron arrays in this study indicates the potential of the developed protocol to interrogate populations of bacteria for resistance integrons. This is highlighted further by the isolation of a novel class 2 integron. This novel class 2 integron from Providencia stuartii possesses a class 2 integrase that is predicted to be fully functional and has a variable region comprising nine ORFs that do not encode AMR genes. Overall, this study demonstrated that integrons are present in all cattle production systems employed in Australia and although the prevalence of integrons appeared to align with the anticipated use of antimicrobials in each system, differences in the integrons from each production system were not evident. As the similarities observed between integrons extend to isolates from organically produced cattle and from non-cattle associated soil samples it is suggested that the majority of integrons identified in this study are not present as a direct result of antimicrobial use in cattle production. Nevertheless, the potential of integrons to capture AMR genes remains and their presence in beef cattle highlights the need for the continued prudent use of antimicrobials.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Integrons</field><field name="subject">Cattle</field><field name="subject">Class 1</field><field name="subject">Class 2</field><field name="subject">Antibiotic resistance</field><field name="subject">Production Systems</field><field name="subject">Environment</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178810</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bacterial Aggregation and Biofilm Formation by Uropathogenic Escherichia coli</field><field name="creator">Yanwen Cheryl-lynn Ong</field><field name="description">Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is one of the most common nosocomial infections and is caused by a range of different uropathogens, particularly by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). Amongst the different virulence factors, biofilm formation and bacterial aggregation, often mediated by cell surface structures such as fimbriae, are common traits among uropathogens that cause CAUTI. In this study, a collection of UPEC isolates were screened for virulence genes and phenotypes associated with urinary tract infections such as biofilm formation and mannose-sensitive haemagglutination. Two strains, E. coli MS2027 (which formed a strong biofilm) and E. coli M184 (which aggregated strongly) were analysed in detail to determine the molecular mechanisms associated with these phenotypes. Transposon mutagenesis of E. coli MS2027 identified type 3 fimbriae as the factor responsible for its strong biofilm growth. Further screening revealed the presence of type 3 fimbriae in uropathogenic Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae and other E. coli. Phylogenetic analysis of the type 3 fimbrial (mrkABCD) genes from these strains revealed they clustered into five distinct clades (A-E) ranging from one to twenty-three members. The majority of the sequences grouped in clade A, which was represented by the mrk gene cluster from the genome sequenced K. pneumoniae strain MGH78578. We demonstrated that type 3 fimbriae are functionally expressed by different Gram negative nosocomial pathogens and present evidence to suggest that they contribute significantly to catheter colonisation. The type 3 fimbrial genes from E. coli MS2027 were found to be located on a conjugative plasmid. Sequencing and annotation revealed that this 42,644 bp plasmid, named pMAS2027, contains 58 putative genes. Bioinformatic analysis identified pMAS2027 as an incompatibility X (IncX1) plasmid. Plasmid pMAS2027 contained genes encoding two important virulence factors, type 3 fimbriae and a type IV secretion (T4S) system. The biofilm ability was solely based on the expression of type 3 fimbriae and not the T4S system. The T4S system, however, accounted for the conjugative ability of pMAS2027. Differential tagging with fluorescent reporter genes demonstrated conjugative transfer of pMAS2027 between cells during biofilm growth. Finaly, transposon mutagenesis of E. coli M184 revealed a number of putative genes potentially responsible for bacterial aggregation. Of these, genes involved in the synthesis of the enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) were shown to be associated with an aggregation phenotype.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">UPEC</field><field name="subject">CAUTI</field><field name="subject">Biofilm</field><field name="subject">Type 3 fimbriae</field><field name="subject">Aggregation</field><field name="subject">Conjugation</field><field name="subject">Escherichia coli</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178812</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of chest physiotherapy on lung function in preterm infants.</field><field name="creator">Judith Hough</field><field name="description">Preterm infants are at an increased risk of lung damage due to the adverse effects of the ventilatory assistance which is required to support their respiration. Chest physiotherapy (CPT) has been proposed as one intervention which can be used to help improve ventilation by assisting in the removal of excess tracheobronchial secretions. The package of CPT used in the preterm infant consists of a variety of techniques which include postural drainage and positioning, active techniques such as percussion and vibrations, and suction. The use of these techniques, in varying combinations, has become traditional treatment for a variety of acute and chronic pulmonary conditions. There has been some attempt in the past to ascertain which techniques produced the most clinically relevant results however study results are equivocal due to the variations in techniques investigated and outcomes measured. In the absence of clear clinical guidelines, techniques used tend to depend on the experience and clinical judgement of individual clinicians. The aim of this thesis was thus to investigate how different components of CPT affect lung function in preterm infants. Two different components of CPT were studied - positioning and active techniques. In total, sixty preterm infants aged less than 32 weeks gestational age participated in five studies which investigated differences in lung function as a result of CPT intervention. The first three studies investigated the differential effects of the body positions of supine, &#188; prone, and prone on lung function in infants who were either mechanically ventilated, were on bubble CPAP, or who were spontaneously ventilating. Measurements of lung function were undertaken using a new non-invasive technique, electrical impedance tomography (EIT), which has opened up new possibilities in the visualisation and quantification of regional lung ventilation in preterm infants. Study results revealed that the previously described reverse pattern of ventilation distribution could not be confirmed in preterm infants on positive pressure ventilatory support, and that distribution of ventilation is affected by head position and body position, and mode of ventilatory support. In infants on positive pressure ventilation the pattern of ventilation was found to be distributed more centrally whereas in spontaneously ventilating infants the pattern of ventilation was directed more to the non-dependent lung. The fourth study consisted of a Cochrane review which was undertaken to determine the evidence available for the use of active CPT in infants receiving mechanical ventilation, and to determine the effects of the different types of active CPT. The results of the Cochrane review did not provide sufficient evidence on which to base clinical practice, and a large multi-centre RCT wasrecommended. However, it was apparent that before undertaking an RCT, there was a need to be clear on what measurable outcomes would be most clinically relevant. Consequently, the fifth study was undertaken as a pilot trial to asses the feasibility of the use of EIT in the assessment of lung function in a trial of active techniques of CPT. The pilot data from this study confirms that ventilation distribution can feasibly be used as an outcome measurement in the assessment of lung function in infants having active CPT. However, further trials are required to assess the risks and benefits of CPT in the treatment of respiratory diseases in ventilated infants. This research has provided new knowledge on the topic of the study of lung function in the preterm infant, in particular with regard to the effect of positioning of the head and body in different modes of ventilation. It has not only added to the knowledge base for neonatal physiotherapy by providing evidence for the efficacy of interventions but also by improving the understanding of the mechanisms which underlie the application of the different physiotherapy techniques. The findings of the reported studies have identified implications for clinical practice and further potential research directions to improve management of this complex clinical population.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178815</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computational Modelling of High-Temperature Gas Effects with Application to Hypersonic Flows</field><field name="creator">Rowan Gollan</field><field name="description">During atmospheric entry, a spacecraft's aeroshell uses a thermal protection system (TPS) to withstand severe thermal loads. Heating to the vehicle surface arises as convective, catalytic and radiative heat flux due to the high temperature of the shockwave compressed gases surrounding the aeroshell. The problem for the TPS designer is that the heat load estimates are based on phenomenological models which have questionable validity and, thus, large uncertainty. As an example, recent analyses of heat loads for a proposed aerocapture vehicle designed for Titan differ by up to an order of magnitude. This uncertainty stems from the complexity of the blunt body flow field and the associated physical effects: thermochemical nonequilibrium; ablation and vehicle surface catalycity; and radiating flow. The motivation for this thesis is to develop computational tools that give accurate estimates of vehicle heat transfer as an input for design calculations. With that goal in mind, this thesis work has focussed on one aspect of this problem and that is the modelling of thermochemical nonequilibrium. The longer term goal is to produce tools which can be used to compute the high-temperature, radiating flow fields about aeroshell configurations; the modelling work presented here on thermochemical nonequilibrium effects is a foundation for tackling the radiating flow problem. The modelling work was implemented in an existing flow solver which solves the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with a finite volume method. As part of this work, the flow solver was verified by two methods: the Method of Manufactured Solutions to verify the spatial accuracy for purely supersonic flow; and the Method of Exact Solutions --- the flow problem being an oblique detonation wave --- to verify the spatial accuracy for flows with embedded shocks. Validation of the flow solver, without any of the complexity of thermochemical nonequilibrium, was performed by comparing numerical simulation results to experiments which measured shock detachment on spheres fired into noble gases. A model for chemical nonequilibrium based on the Law of Mass Action and using finite-rate kinetics was coupled with the flow solver. The implementation was verified on two test problems. The first treated a closed-vessel reactor of a hydrogen-iodine mixture, and the second computed the chemically relaxing flow behind a normal shock in air. For validation, the implementation was tested by computing ignition delay times in hydrogen-air mixtures and comparing to experimental results. It was found that the selection of a chemical kinetics scheme can complicate validation, that is, a poor choice of reaction scheme leads to poor computational results yet the implementation is correct. As further validation, a series of experiments on the shock detachment distance on spheres fired into air was compared against numerical simulations based on the present work. Two models for species diffusion were also implemented: Fick's first law approximation and the Stefan-Maxwell equations. These models were verified by comparison to an exact solution for binary diffusion of two semi-infinite slabs. The more general problem of thermochemical nonequilibrium was also pursued. A multi-temperature model, one translational/rotational temperature and multiple vibrational temperatures, was developed as appropriate for hypersonic flows. The model uses the Landau-Teller expression to compute the rate of vibrational-translational energy exchange and the Schwartz-Slawsky-Herzfeld expression for vibrational-vibrational energy exchange. The time constants for the rate expressions are estimated by a number of methods such as the use of SSH theory and the Millikan-White correlation. The coupling of vibrational nonequilibrium effects with the fluid dynamics was tested by computing the flow of nitrogen over an infinite cylinder. The simplified problem of a vibrationally relaxing flow behind a shock, without reactions, was compared to other calculations in the literature. This case tested the multi-temperature formulation, with oxygen and nitrogen each being ascribed their own vibrational temperatures. The coupling of chemistry and vibrational nonequilibrium uses the model by Knab, Fruehauf and Messerschmid. The complete model for thermochemical nonequilibrium was verified by calculating the relaxation of oxygen behind a strong shock. The models developed provide a basis for computing radiating flow fields, however the radiating flow problem cannot be attempted based on this work alone. Instead, a more immediate application of the modelling work was the simulation of expansion tube operation. It is desirable to simulate an impulse facility to give the experimenters access to aspects of experiment that are not directly attainable by experiment; especially a complete characterisation of the test flow properties. The modelling work and code development, as part of this thesis, addresses this need of experimenters. Two large-scale simulations are presented as a demonstration of the modelling work: (a) a simulation of an expansion tube in expansion mode; and (b) a simulation of an expansion tube in nonreflected shock tube mode.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="subject">hypersonics</field><field name="subject">atmospheric-entry vehicles</field><field name="subject">high-temperature gas effects</field><field name="subject">nonequilibrium flows</field><field name="subject">expansion tubes</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178818</field></doc><doc><field name="title">HIGH FREQUENCY (1000 HZ) TYMPANOMETRY AND ACOUSTIC REFLEX FINDINGS IN NEWBORN AND 6-WEEK-OLD INFANTS</field><field name="creator">Rafidah Mazlan</field><field name="description">Tympanometry and acoustic stapedial reflex (ASR) are routinely used in audiology clinics to assess the functional integrity of the eardrum and middle ear system in humans. Conventional tympanometry (which delivers a probe tone of 226 Hz into the ear canal and measures the mobility of the eardrum as the air pressure in the ear canal is varied) and acoustic reflex testing are effective in detecting middle ear pathologies in children and adults. However, the clinical application of these two tests to infants younger than 7 months has major limitations. In recent years, high frequency tympanometry (HFT) with a probe tone of 1000 Hz has been trialled successfully in young infants (&lt; 7 months) and research on ASRs as they apply to this age group is continuing. Although preliminary HFT data for this population are emerging, there has been no detailed study that describes the effect of age on HFT and ASR results, no clear guideline on ways to interpret the HFT results, and no investigation to measure the feasibility and reliability of the ASR findings. For these reasons, systematic investigation into the use of HFT and ASR measures for evaluating the middle ear function of young infants is warranted. This thesis aimed to: (i) investigate the feasibility of obtaining HFT and ASR findings from newborn and 6-week-old infants, and study the characteristics of the immittance findings in these two age groups; (ii) investigate methods within HFT to measure the middle ear admittance of newborn babies; (iii) establish normative HFT data from healthy newborn babies using the new component compensation method; (iv) examine the test-retest reliability of the ASR test in healthy neonates; and (v) investigate the test-retest reliability of the ASR test in 6-week-old infants. The aims of the thesis were met through five studies. In study one (Chapter 2), a pilot study was conducted to examine the feasibility of performing HFT and ASR in 42 healthy infants and study the characteristics of the immittance findings obtained from these infants using a longitudinal study design. In this pilot study, all infants were tested at birth and then re-tested approximately 6 weeks after the first test. This study confirmed the feasibility of obtaining valid immittance findings from healthy young infants. Most importantly, the findings of this pilot study revealed that the mean values of the majority of HFT parameters and acoustic stapedial reflex threshold (ASRT) obtained at 6 weeks were significantly greater than those obtained at birth, indicating the need to have separate sets of normative data for both tests for newborn and 6-week-old infants. In study 2 (Chapter 3), three different methods to measure middle ear admittance (often described as peak compensated static admittance) in 36 healthy neonates were compared. The three methods were the traditional baseline compensation method (compensated for the susceptance component at 200 daPa pressure) and two new component compensated methods (compensated for both the susceptance and conductance components at 200 daPa and -400 daPa). The results showed that the mean middle ear admittances obtained by compensating for the two components of admittance at a pressure of 200 daPa (YCC200) and &#61485;-400 daPa (YCC-400) were significantly greater than that using the traditional baseline compensation method (YBC). The higher mean admittance results obtained using the new component compensated methods suggests that the two new methods have the potential to better separate normal from abnormal admittance results. The test-retest reliability of YBC, YCC200 and YCC-400 was investigated, with the result that a lower test-retest reliability was obtained for YCC-400 than for the other two measures. It was, therefore, concluded that the component compensation method compensated at 200 daPa may serve as an alternative method for estimating middle ear admittance, especially in the context of assessing neonates using HFT. In study 3 (Chapter 4), normative data were gathered using the new component compensation method (compensated at 200 daPa) on a group of 157 healthy newborn babies. In addition to the component compensated static admittance (YCC), normative data showing the 90 % ranges for tympanometric peak pressure, admittance at 200 daPa, uncompensated peak admittance, and traditional baseline compensated static admittance (YBC) were established in this study. No gender effect was found on any of the tympanometric measures. In study 4 (Chapter 5), the use of ASR to evaluate middle ear function in neonates was studied. The feasibility of obtaining ipsilateral ASR from neonates by stimulating their ears with a 2 kHz tone and broadband noise (BBN) was demonstrated. ASRs were elicited from 91.3% of 219 full-term normal neonates, while the remaining 8.7% of neonates who had flat tympanograms and no transient evoked otoacoustic emissions did not exhibit ASRs. Good test-retest reliability was demonstrated in the ASRT obtained using both the 2 kHz and BBN stimulus; there was no significant difference between test and retest conditions and intra-correlation coefficients of 0.83 for the 2 kHz tone and 0.76 for the BBN stimulus. In the last study (Chapter 6), the test-retest reliability of ASRT obtained from 70 6-week-old infants was investigated. The methodology described in Chapter 5 was followed. No significant difference in ASRT between test and retest conditions was found for the 2 kHz tone (mean ASRT = 67.3 dB HL versus 67.1 dB HL) and BBN stimulus (mean ASRT = 80.9 dB HL versus 81.6 dB HL). Good test-retest reliability of ASRT with intra-correlation coefficients of 0.78 was found for both the 2 kHz tone and the BBN stimulus. In essence, through achieving the aforementioned aims, the current research program was able to enhance the minimal literature available concerning the use of HFT and ASR testing in young infants. Ultimately, the findings presented in this thesis will inform clinicians of the recent developments in HFT and ASR testing, and assist them in evaluating the middle ear function of young infants with accuracy and confidence.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">High frequency tympanometry (1000 Hz)</field><field name="subject">acoustic stapedial reflex</field><field name="subject">newborn</field><field name="subject">6-week-old infants</field><field name="subject">test-retest reliability</field><field name="subject">component compensated static admittance</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178820</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficacy of a Multifaceted Gait Analysis Approach: Applications to Function following Limb Salvage Surgery for Bone Sarcoma</field><field name="creator">Christopher Carty</field><field name="description">The purpose of this investigation was to assess the efficacy of a multifaceted gait analysis approach using a group of twenty osteosarcoma patients who underwent limb salvage surgery. Mean age at time of surgery was 16.1 years (range: 7-29), mean age at time of evaluation was 23.55 years (range: 11-43). Nine patients were treated with a Stryker Howmedica Modular Resection System (Stryker Kalamazoo, USA) and eleven patients were treated with a Stanmore custom made prosthesis (Stanmore implants worldwide Ltd, Stanmore, UK). Ten control participants with a mean age of 24.9 (range: 14-36) were recruited for the study. Ethical approval was gained through The University of Queensland Ethics Committee and The Royal Children&#8217;s Hospital and Health Service district Ethics Committee. Investigations included subjective, kinematic, kinetic, electromyographic and bioenergetic assessments. The subjective assessment incorporated results from the Musculoskeletal Tumour Society Rating Scale (MSTS) and the Toronto Extremity Salvage Score (TESS). Overall impairment was found to be 83.33% according to results of the MSTS and overall disability was found to be 86.00% according to results of the TESS. Kinematic findings showed that limb salvage participants walked with reduced velocity (p &lt; 0.01) and increased step asymmetry (p &lt; 0.01). Patients exhibited an increase in plantarflexion during the loading response (p &lt; 0.001) and during terminal stance (p &lt; 0.05), and an increase in dorsiflexion during mid-stance (p &lt; 0.001). Knee kinematics revealed reduced extension during the loading response (p &lt; 0.001) and increased frontal plane excursion throughout the gait cycle (p &lt; 0.01). Patients exhibited increased lateral lean during loading response at the trunk (p &lt; 0.05). Kinetic findings revealed a reduction in the magnitude of vertical ground reaction force during the loading response (p &lt; 0.001) and a reduction in the magnitude of the anterior/posterior ground reaction shear force during terminal stance (p = 0.01). Furthermore, the internal ankle plantarflexor moment in terminal stance was reduced (p &lt; 0.001), all sagittal plane knee moments were reduced (p &lt; 0.05) and the internal hip adductor moment in terminal stance was reduced (p &lt; 0.01). Electromyographic findings found that the limb salvage participants activated their rectus femoris for a significantly prolonged period (p &lt; 0.5) and exhibited increased bilateral co-contraction of their rectus femoris and medial hamstring muscles (p &lt; 0.05) compared with control participants. Bioenergetic findings revealed that the limb salvage participants exhibited an increased energetic cost (p &lt; 0.01) and consumption rate (p &lt; 0.01). Moderate correlations were observed between electromyographic and bioenergetic findings. Multivariate methods suggested that muscle removal, knee extension strength and knee flexion range of motion were all significant predictors of locomotor function. Length of bone resection and time from surgery were not predictive of post-operative function. The findings supported the efficacy of a multifaceted gait analysis approach for the assessment of pathological function under research conditions. The combined approach, using multiple measurements, allowed determination of functional status following musculoskeletal alteration. This enabled identification of primary and secondary compensations and allowed recommendations for improved treatment and rehabilitation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gait</field><field name="subject">biomechanics</field><field name="subject">Motion analysis</field><field name="subject">knee replacement</field><field name="subject">osteosarcoma</field><field name="subject">functional outcome</field><field name="subject">limb salvage surgery</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178822</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prescription medicine samples and therapy initiation. Developing a best practice system with community pharmacists in Australia</field><field name="creator">Gregory Kyle</field><field name="description">Prescription medicine samples are a product based promotion designed to facilitate brand switching or uptake of a new product. Marketing of pharmaceuticals differs from other products since the primary decision maker (doctor) is not the ultimate consumer (patient). Marketing of medicines also has an overlay of government regulations and political influence. It is argued whether free samples of prescription medicines provided to doctors constitute a &#8220;gift&#8221; or a trial quantity with which to initiate therapy and test patient tolerance of the drug concerned. Either way, samples are an integral part of the prescription medicine marketing tapestry and they have become woven into the &#8220;fabric&#8221; of drug promotion. The international literature abounds with papers describing pharmaceutical promotion and myriads of surveys obtaining prescribers&#8217; opinions about pharmaceutical promotion. Few studies have been conducted or reported to ascertain the reasons behind the opinions expressed as disagreement/agreement scales to specific statements. Interventions to alter practice targeting alternative methods of distribution of samples (rather than direct from company to prescriber) are also rare; therefore the aim of this research was to qualitatively explore opinions regarding samples to develop an intervention to ensure samples do not have an adverse effect on prescribing practice and to test the model in a practice environment. In order to assess the place of samples within the totality of pharmaceutical promotion, a model was derived from the literature and tested with a hypothetical, but realistic practice-based scenario. This highlighted the interplay between the various methods involved in pharmaceutical promotion, their target audiences and the potential interplay and synergism that could be achieved through a co-ordinated campaign. Quantification of the expenditure on samples was also required in the Australian context to assess the potential impact of interventions targeting this promotional mode. Samples were found to account for approximately 5% of the total marketing spend in Australia. No clear relationship could be found between sample expenditure and drug sales, utilizing data on the proton pump inhibitor therapeutic class. However, a pattern of decaying spending was found between the amount spent on samples per unit pack dispensed and the time a product had been available on the market. A range of interested parties were then interviewed to gain their opinions about free prescription medicine samples. The interviews were split into two groups: consumers, pharmacists and practicing general practitioners (GPs) provided an operational level focus, while a range of key informants from organisations involved in Quality Use of Medicines in Australia provided a strategic overview. The transcripts of the focus groups and interviews were qualitatively analysed to extract key themes which were quite similar. Examples included &#8216;pay&#8217; in the operational group compared to &#8216;cost&#8217; in the strategic group. These concepts express a similar sentiment, yet &#8216;pay&#8217; is a more personal action whereas &#8216;cost&#8217; does not imply who must meet the financial outlay. These resultant themes formed the basis of the intervention developed to pilot in a practice environment to assess its practicality for wider study. In addition to the extensive interview process, a mail survey was conducted in three divisions (geographical groupings) of general practice. Each family doctor (General Practitioner (GP)) and community pharmacist within the divisions received a questionnaire to gather their opinions about samples. This was the first time GPs and pharmacists had been surveyed simultaneously to gather comparative results. No differences were found between the metropolitan division and the accumulated results from the two regional divisions. Pharmacists and GPs differed predominantly in their perceptions of promotional influence of samples, appropriateness of self use and meeting legal requirements for labelling dispensed medicines. These factors were incorporated in the pilot study design. An action research methodology was utilised to assess the practicality of community pharmacist dispensing of starter packs for antihypertensives and antidepressants in two regional GP practices in Queensland, Australia. In this pilot study, a total of 32 starter packs were prescribed to 31 patients over the four months of the intervention period, with 29 (91%) dispensed at a study pharmacy and 17 (53%) of subsequent full prescriptions able to be tracked through Medicare Australia data or the study pharmacies. Antidepressants comprised the majority of prescriptions (n=16, 55%) Each of the 29 patients who received a starter pack completed a patient survey which demonstrated high levels of support (n=22, 76%) for the model in the pilot. GPs and pharmacists involved in the pilot were also generally supportive of the pilot model. In conclusion, opinions held about free prescription medicine samples by a wide range of apparently disparate groups show similar themes and community pharmacist involvement in dispensing starter (or sample) packs has general acceptance. The model piloted in this research was applicable in daily practice for general practitioners and community pharmacists in Australia. Consumers accepted the pilot model as an acceptable change to current procedures. The research presented in this thesis provides a solid foundation for development of a more widespread trial for dispensing of all prescription medicine starter packs through community pharmacies to be rigorously evaluated in Australia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Prescription medicine</field><field name="subject">sample pack</field><field name="subject">qualitative modelling</field><field name="subject">influence</field><field name="subject">marketing</field><field name="subject">practice research</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178825</field></doc><doc><field name="title">XYLEM FLOW IN CUT ACACIA HOLOSERICEA STEMS</field><field name="creator">Jilushi Damunupola</field><field name="description">Acacia holosericea A. Cunn. Ex G. Don (Velvet Leaf Wattle, Family Mimosaceae) is indigenous to Australia and holds promise as a novel cut foliage crop due to its silvery green silky phyllodes. Insufficient water uptake, possibly due to low stem hydraulic conductivity (Kh), is potentially responsible for early wilting and desiccation of phyllodes and limiting vase life. This study aimed to characterize the anatomy of stem xylem conduits and determine cation (K+ and Ca2+) mediated stem Kh. Differential localization of Ca2+ in xylem vessels and the effects of KCl and CaCl2 salts as cation contributors in vase solutions were also evaluated for their effects on cut foliage longevity. Anatomical characteristics of stem xylem conduits were studied using light, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Tracheids and vessels with simple perforation plates were the principal water conducting cells. SEM and TEM revealed bordered vestured intervessel pits in xylem conduits. Vestures were branched and coralloid-like structures. Xylem conduit lengths were assessed by ink perfusion. The majority of conduits (89%) were short (1 to 5 cm), and only ~ 2% were long (15 to 16 cm). Mean conduit diameter was 77 &#177; 0.9 &#181;m, with 29% of conduits in the range 70 to 80 &#181;m. Effects of S-carvone (0, 0.318, and 0.636 mM), a monoterpene inhibitor of wound-healing enzyme inhibitor found in caraway (Carum carvi) and dill (Anethum graveoleus) seeds, on several native Australian, non-proteaceous cut flower and foliage species including A. holosericea (Mimosaceae), Baeckea frutescens (Myrtaceae), Chamelaucium uncinatum cv. &#8216;Mullering Brook&#8217; (Myrtaceae), and the non-native Chrysanthemum sp. cv. &#8216;Dark Splendid Reagan&#8217; (Asteraceae) were examined. As comparator treatments regular recutting of stem ends and use of standard tap water (STW: 0.7 mM CaCl2, 1.5 mM NaHCO3, and 0.05 mM CuSO4 in vases) were tested. S-Carvone treatments significantly (P&#8804;0.05) extended the vase life of B. frutescens and C. uncinatum, constituting the first report of positive S-carvone effects on the vase life of Myrtaceous species. S-Carvone at 0.318 and 0.636 mM did not have antibacterial effects against Bacillus cereus (the main vase solution microbe) either in vitro or in the vase solution. Regular recutting of stem ends consistently improved all vase life parameters [viz. relative fresh weight (RFW), solution uptake, and vase life] in the three native species examined. STW had a positive effect on RFW and solution uptake only for A. holosericea cut foliage. Effects of di- and monovalent cations (Ca2+ as CaCl2 and K+ as KCl) on stem Kh of cut stem segments were studied. Abundance of Ca2+ on pit membranes versus xylem lumen wall surfaces was investigated using a novel low vacuum (LV) SEM plus energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) microanalysis technique. Both salts (0.1, 1, 10, and 100 mM KCl or CaCl2) did not significantly increase stem Kh compared to the corresponding deionised (DI) water controls (experiment 1). Highest increase in Kh was with KCl and CaCl2 at 10 and 1 mM, respectively. Increases in Kh with 100 mM KCl and CaCl2 were significant over DI water (experiment 2) for long (10 and 20 cm) and short (2 and 5 cm) stem segments, respectively. Increases in Kh of 1.2- and 2.4-fold for 100 mM KCl over DI water were found with increasing stem length from 2 to 20 cm. Kh decreased as stem segment length increased from 5 to 20 cm. However, contrasting results were found with 100 mM CaCl2, where &#916;Kh was larger in shorter (2 cm) than longer (20 cm) segments. To prevent dislocation of ions and distortion damage to the specimens, stem pieces were first LV freeze-dried, and then carbon-coated, viewed under SEM, and analysed for elemental composition and distribution by EDX. However, the method could not identify specific calcium peaks in xylem vessels perhaps because background signals were too high, and tissue topography interfered with signal detection. Effects of KCl and CaCl2 on vase life were also tested. RFW, solution uptake, and vase life were higher with 10 mM KCl and CaCl2 in the vase solution than with 0, 1, and 100 mM. STW had a significant (P&#8804;0.05) positive effect on RFW and solution uptake rate when tested against deionised water, 10 mM KCl and 10 mM CaCl2. Different combinations of 0.05 mM CuSO4, 10 mM CaCl2, and 10 mM KCl were also tested as vase solutions. A significant positive effect on RFW and vase life was obtained with CuSO4 alone, CaCl2 alone, and CuSO4 plus KCl. Only CuSO4 and CaCl2 gave a significant positive effect on solution uptake rate. None of the eight treatments tested showed a consistent effect on stomatal conductance or stem Kh. Overall, the research revealed that tracheids and vessels with simple perforation plates and bordered vestured intervessel pits are the principal water conducting cells in A. holosericea. LV-SEM-EDX technique was unable to assess the spatial distribution of Ca2+ on xylem vessels, but this was the first attempt to apply this technique. Also, this is the first report on the extension of vase life of B. frutescens and C. uncinatum (Myrtaceous species) using S-carvone. In vase solutions, 0.05 mM CuSO4, 10 mM KCl plus 0.05 mM CuSO4 and 10 mM CaCl2 should have positive influences on the water balance of A. holosericea cut foliage stems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CaCl2, cut foliage, electron microscopy, hydraulic conductivity, KCl, pit membrane, vase life, xylem</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178857</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CO-ORDINATION OF THE ABDOMINAL AND PELVIC FLOOR MUSCLES</field><field name="creator">Ruth Sapsford</field><field name="description">The pelvic floor muscles (PFM) form the base of the abdominal canister, and like the other muscle groups around the canister, the abdominal muscles and the diaphragm, they contribute to and are affected by pressures within the canister. But they also have a role in organ support and continence. In urinary incontinence, clinical rehabilitation has targeted the PFM in isolation. It aims to build up strength and endurance of these muscles, but without consideration of the influence of intra-abdominal pressure, and therefore the co-ordination of muscles that generate that pressure, on PFM activity. Strengthening of the PFM has not resolved incontinence for all women, and the benefits are not sustained in the long term. Thus consideration of factors beyond the pelvic floor (PF) may lead to better outcomes for rehabilitation in both the short and long term. Thus these studies aimed to investigate the influences of abdominal muscle activity and spinal posture on the recruitment of the PFM. The studies firstly investigated the association between the abdominal and PFM during voluntary tasks. Further studies examined the effect of automatic recruitment of the PFM and the abdominal muscles with postural disturbances and changes in spinal posture, and whether there was a difference in recruitment between layers of the PFM complex during function. Electromyographic (EMG) studies, using fine wire and/or surface electrodes, were performed to record patterns of muscle activity, while, in selected studies, this was accompanied by pressures recorded within the stomach, urethra, bladder, vagina, anus and rectum, to monitor the effects of the striated muscle activity on intra-abdominal pressure and urethral function. When the PFM were voluntarily contracted in healthy women, there was a co-ordinated response in all the abdominal muscles, which varied with the position of the lumbar spine. Conversely, when the lower abdominal muscles were drawn in towards the spine there was an increase in IAP, urethral pressure and PFM EMG activity. Relaxation of the abdominal muscles and bulging of the relaxed abdominal wall decreased PFM activity and urethral pressure below their resting baselines. Thus, voluntary activation of the abdominal or PFM influences activity in the other muscle group. Other studies investigated the automatic responses of abdominal and PFM during breathing, postural perturbation, sitting and coughing. Quiet breathing was associated with modulation of PFM EMG with greater activity during expiration than inspiration, in association with variations in abdominal muscle activity. Hypercapnoea accentuated these results. Postural perturbations generated co-activation of the PF and abdominal muscles before the onset of deltoid activity with sustained activity through out repeated arm movements. Changes in spinal posture also affected PFM activity. Like the abdominal muscles, PFM were less active when sitting in a slumped position. Similar changes occurred in women with stress urinary incontinence but with lower pelvic floor muscle activity levels. Women with stress urinary incontinence also had less lordosis of the lumbar spine in upright sitting and a trend for greater superficial abdominal muscle activity than continent women. Activity of the superficial, but not deep, PFM during coughing, was affected by different sitting postures, with greater activity during coughing in slumped than in upright postures. Different breathing patterns and changes in posture also affected IAP and abdominal muscle recruitment patterns during coughing. Investigation of PFM activity during functional tasks indicates that factors beyond the PF influence its activity. The findings from these studies indicate that PFM activity is inter-related with spinal posture and abdominal muscle activity. While most of these studies were conducted in healthy women, there are a number of different types of PF problems in women, in which the mechanics of the dysfunction differ from stress urinary incontinence. PFM activity has not been investigated in all types of PF dysfunction. The findings of co-ordinated recruitment of the abdominal and PFM and the effect of spinal posture on PFM function provide some evidence that PFM rehabilitation should not be undertaken in isolation, and that there is a likely advantage from exercising with a neutral lumbar spine. There is a need for further investigation of this co-ordinated muscle recruitment in subjects with different types of dysfunction, not just stress urinary incontinence. Findings from such investigations could then point the way forward to improved rehabilitation methods for people with problems, and more suitable methods of maintaining pelvic floor health.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pelvic floor muscles</field><field name="subject">abdominal muscles</field><field name="subject">Electromyography (emg)</field><field name="subject">urethral pressure</field><field name="subject">lumbar spine</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178859</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Galaxy Morphology &amp; Star Formation in the Supercluster Environment</field><field name="creator">Jason A. Moore</field><field name="description">In this thesis we provide a better understanding of the role of the inter-cluster filamentary environment in the evolution of galaxy properties, relating that to the physical mechanisms involved. We examine a poorer supercluster structure and describe how it compares with the richer regime, deciding whether the same processes are responsible for driving galaxy evolution in both cases. We develop a new approach to automated galaxy morphology classification, undertake an extensive observational survey of a nearby supercluster and investigate the evolution of galaxy properties within this structure, considering the filamentary environments that we confirm exist. Firstly, we present an application of Mathematical Morphology (MM) for the classification of astronomical objects, both for star/galaxy differentiation and galaxy morphology classification. We demonstrate that, for CCD images, 99.3 &#177; 3.8% of galaxies can be separated from stars using MM, with 19.4&#177;7.9% of the stars being misclassified. We demonstrate that, for photographic plate images, the number of galaxies correctly separated from the stars can be increased using our MM diffraction spike tool, which allows 51.0&#177;6.0% of the high-brightness galaxies that are inseparable in current techniques to be correctly classified, with only 1.4 &#177; 0.5% of the high-brightness stars contaminating the population. We demonstrate that elliptical (E) and late-type spiral (Sc-Sd) galaxies can be classified using MM at an accuracy of 91.4 &#177; 7.8%. It is a method involving less &#8216;free parameters&#8217; than current techniques, especially automated machine learning algorithms. The limitations of MM due to seeing and distance are also discussed. We examine various star/galaxy differentiation and galaxy morhpology classification techniques commonly used today, and show that the above MM techniques compare very favourably. Secondly, we present a wide-field photometric and spectroscopic study of the supercluster SCL266 (z = 0.068). We have obtained CCD imaging in B-, R- and I-bands covering 5 clusters within the structure, and spectroscopy within the region of 3 of the clusters and the filamentary environment between them. We have over 950 redshifts obtained and 161 galaxies confirmed as members of the supercluster structure. The galaxy morphologies are derived using the MM techniques we have developed. We show that the population of passive, early-type galaxies extends into the dense regions of the filaments and is not just confined to the higher-density clusters, indicating that the denser filamentary environment hastens the galaxy evolution within it. The star-forming, late-type galaxies are distributed throughout the entirety of the supercluster structure. We show that both the mean star formation rate and the fraction of star-forming galaxies decrease strongly as a function of distance along the filaments towards the cluster centres. Given these observations we conclude that the evolution occurring within this poor supercluster begins within the filaments up to 4 Mpc away from the cluster centres, and is driven by long time-scale mechanisms involving encounters between neighbouring galaxies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178863</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teachers as Parents Project: Examining the work-family interface and the efficacy of a workplace parenting intervention targeting work and family conflict</field><field name="creator">Divna Haslam</field><field name="description">Behavioural and emotional problems in children have been linked with a number of deleterious effects for the child, their family and the community at large. Research has demonstrated that targeting parents through behavioural family interventions is an effective way of ameliorating the negative long term effects of early behaviour problems. A number of evidence-based interventions have been shown to be effective in reducing dysfunctional parenting practices and reducing the severity and intensity of behaviour problems however less than 10% of parents&#8217; access parenting services and even fewer access evidence-based interventions. Some researchers now advocate that a population approach that emphasizes prevention rather than treatment and considers parenting in its broader ecological context is required to increase parental access to evidence-based parenting interventions and reduce population levels of disruptive behaviour problems. One important context that affects parenting is the workplace. Changing economic and demographic climates mean the majority of parents are now employed and must balance the competing demands of work and family commitments leading to increased levels of work and family conflict as functioning in one domain invariably effects functioning in the other. High levels of work and family conflict have been shown to increase psychological distress and dysfunctional parenting and are associated with a range of negative organisational outcomes such as increased turnover and absenteeism. Additionally, levels of work and family conflict are highest in parents of young children indicating that balancing work and parenting is particularly difficult at a point in a child&#8217;s life where there is greatest development plasticity. This thesis argues that one way to improve parents&#8217; access to services and to reduce work and family conflict is to provide support to working parents in the form of a workplace parenting intervention. Such an intervention has the potential to ease the burden on working parents, increase parental access to evidence-based parenting support and reduce population levels of disruptive behaviour problems. This research comprises of a randomised controlled trial of Workplace Triple P, a variant of Triple P- Positive Parenting Program that is tailored to the specific needs of working parents. Two studies are presented. Study 1 examined the utility of a model that posits that the relationship between parental exposure to disruptive behaviour problems and occupational stress is mediated by family-work conflict. Data analyses supported the hypothesised model. The relationship between parental exposure to disruptive behaviour problems and occupational stress was fully mediated by family-work conflict. The results of this study provide a rationale for examining parenting in a workplace context by demonstrating that disruptive behaviour problems in the children of employees are related to higher levels of occupational stress and that reducing disruptive behaviour and family-work conflict should result in reductions in occupational stress. Study 2 built on the findings of Study 1 by evaluating the effectiveness of Workplace Triple P, a workplace parenting intervention that aims to assist parents to more effectively manage work and family demands. Using a sample of teachers balancing work and parenting commitments, a randomised controlled trial was conducted comparing Workplace Triple P to a waitlist control condition. Results indicated that participants who completed the Workplace Triple P intervention reported improvements in five key outcome areas: disruptive behaviour problems, parenting style and satisfaction, personal adjustment, work and family conflict and occupational wellbeing. Specifically, compared with participants in the waitlist control condition participants in the intervention condition reported that their child displayed lower numbers of disruptive behaviours and engaged in problem behaviour less frequently, that they themselves engaged less in verbose, over-reactive and lax parenting styles, that they felt more confident in dealing with a range of behaviour problems across a range of home and community settings and enjoyed parenting more. Participants in the intervention condition also reported lower levels of personal anxiety and depression. The intervention was also effective at improving work-related variables. Participants who completed the Workplace Triple P intervention reported lower levels of work-family conflict, family-work conflict and occupational stress, as well as reporting increased levels of occupational efficacy. No changes were reported for participants in the waitlist control condition. Participants in the intervention condition were reassessed at 4-months post intervention. Results indicated that all intervention gains were maintained. Together these studies contribute significantly to our understanding of work-family interface by providing insight into the mechanisms by which family life exerts an influence on occupational stress and by demonstrating that a workplace parenting intervention has the potential to improve functioning both family and occupational domains. The findings have significant implications for assisting parents more effectively manage work and family demands, for increasing parental access to services, and informing family-friendly policies and practices. Research, clinical and policy implications are discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">parenting, work and family conflict, Triple P, Workplace Triple P, WPTP, teacher stress, intervention, disruptive behaviour, work-family conflict, family-work conflict</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178867</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploitation in Older Adults: Personal Competence Factors and Social Vulnerability</field><field name="creator">Donna Pinsker</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT Exploitation of older people can result in devastating emotional and financial consequences. Researchers and policy makers have widely recognised the deleterious effects of exploitation on older adults, particularly cognitively impaired older people. Studies to date have provided basic information about the demographic and health characteristics that contribute to exploitation in later life, namely extreme dependence, frailty, social isolation, severe physical illness, and cognitive impairment. However, an overarching explanatory framework of vulnerability, and clinical instruments to aid with identifying those individuals at elevated risk of exploitation a priori have been lacking. Furthermore, the specific cognitive and social factors at the level of the individual which promote vulnerability to exploitation remain largely unexplored. The present research was directed towards addressing these issues. For definitional purposes, the term social vulnerability is used throughout in reference to an individual&#8217;s degree of susceptibility to exploitation. Exploitation of older people can take many forms including social and sexual exploitation, mistreatment, and deprivation of rights. Financial exploitation in particular is a relatively widespread phenomenon among older people, and may be a salient marker of social vulnerability in later life. In Chapter 1 of this dissertation, literature relevant to financial exploitation and social vulnerability more generally among older people is reviewed, and a conceptual framework for describing and explaining heightened vulnerability is presented. Central to this framework are various factors of personal competence at the level of the individual (i.e., intelligence, cognitive functioning, social intelligence, social skill, personality traits) which, in theoretical terms, contribute to, or protect against, exploitation. Chapter 2 details the development and psychometric evaluation of a standardised scale for assessing social vulnerability among older adults (termed the SVS15). Given that financial exploitation may be a pertinent marker of social vulnerability in older people, item content for the scale includes items of a financial nature. The results of two studies provided support for the reliability (internal consistency) and validity (known-groups) of the SVS15. Results of a factor analysis revealed a two-factor solution, with the emerging factors labelled gullibility and credulity. Stability in factor structure of the SVS15 was established in an independent sample using structural equation modelling. Chapters 3 and 4 of the dissertation detail the methodology employed in, and results of, a series of three studies systematically investigating the relationships between personal competence factors and social vulnerability in older people. Using multiple regression analyses, non-significant associations between basic demographic characteristics and social vulnerability were found in a nonclinical older sample, indicating that heightened vulnerability to exploitation is not readily explained by age, gender, or education. Rather, general cognitive functioning emerged as the most significant correlate of SVS15 scores in a combined clinical and nonclinical sample of older adults such that poorer cognitive functioning was associated with greater vulnerability to exploitation. Executive functioning in particular showed significant overlap with SVS15 scores after controlling for differences in memory and age. These results support the inclusion of standardised neuropsychological tests of memory and executive functioning (tests which are routinely used) when issues of social vulnerability arise. After general cognitive functioning, social measures of self-awareness and social skill were also important correlates of social vulnerability scores, indicating that social measures could also contribute useful information when assessing social vulnerability in older people. From an applied perspective, Chapter 5 of the thesis presents normative data for the SVS15, and an examination of the Tclinical utility of the scale using individual case studies of older adults diagnosed with a dementia syndrome. In Chapter 6, an amalgamation of the results from the project is presented, and the theoretical and clinical contributions of the findings are highlighted. TThe findings contribute to the extant literature in two ways: (1) through the development of aT potentially useful and psychometrically sound instrument which targets symptoms of social Tvulnerability more directly than existing neuropsychological measures and (2) by enhancing the current understanding of the cognitive and social personal competence factors associated with heightened vulnerability in later life.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="subject">social vulnerability</field><field name="subject">financial exploitation</field><field name="subject">dementia</field><field name="subject">memory</field><field name="subject">cognitive functioning</field><field name="subject">neuropsychology</field><field name="subject">ageing</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178868</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology of the zebra shark Stegostoma fasciatum; with emphasis on a seasonal aggregation in south-east Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Christine Louise Dudgeon</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT The zebra shark Stegostoma fasciatum is an oviparous, demersal carpet shark that forms temporary aggregations and is distributed within shallow, coastal, subtropical and tropical waters of the Indo-West Pacific (IWP) region. The IWP region encompasses various densities of human habitation leading to differences in the levels of exploitation of chondrichthyan fishes, which are targeted for local consumption and export. This is reflected in the two current regional IUCN Red List classifications for zebra sharks of &#8216;Least Concern&#8217; and &#8216;Vulnerable&#8217;. Despite the conservation concerns for zebra sharks in the vulnerable parts of their range, as well as importance within the ecotourism industry and collection for aquarium trade, little is known about this species in the wild. The aim of this thesis was to conduct the first intensive examination of population ecology in the zebra shark by: (i) investigating the population structure and environmental parameters associated with a relatively unexploited aggregation of zebra sharks in south-east Queensland, Australia; and (ii) investigating the genetic continuity between zebra shark populations in areas with differing levels of exploitation. To investigate the size and structure of the aggregation at the site The Group in south-east Queensland, photo-identification and mark-recapture methods were employed over a three year period (2003 - 2006). In total 327 individual zebra sharks were identified from 570 photographs. Numbered dart tags on 15 zebra sharks were used to confirm pigmentation patterns were unique and persistent in wild zebra sharks for up to 810 days. Pollock&#8217;s robust design resulted in an annual population estimate of 458 individuals (95% CI = 298 &#8211; 618). The mean number of zebra sharks observed on a single day was 8 (&#177; 8 SE) and the maximum number of zebra sharks seen on a single day was 34. In total, 27% of the sharks were sighted in more than one summer aggregation period and males had greater re-capture probabilities than females. The aggregation consisted exclusively of large (&gt;1800 mm total length) adults with an overall female sex bias of 3.8:1, though sex-ratios varied temporally. Passive acoustic telemetry techniques were employed to investigate the seasonality and residency of the sharks and the environmental parameters associated with their presence at the study site. Five VR2 acoustic receivers were deployed for a period of 21 months (December 2004 &#8211; August 2006) and recorded ten acoustically-tagged zebra sharks (seven females and three males). The sharks showed clear seasonality in their visitation patterns with greatest presence during the austral summer months of November through to February and no presence at all during the winter months from June through to October. However their presence did not coincide with peak water temperatures. Rather there appeared to be a critical minimum water temperature of approximately 22 &#186;C, above which zebra sharks would be present. The tagged zebra sharks displayed greater visitation during the calmest sea conditions. The sharks further displayed diel periodicity with greater during daylight hours, and may be using The Group as a resting site during the inactive diurnal period of the day. Complementing the ecological study on the aggregation, the population genetic structure of 180 zebra sharks from 13 locations throughout the IWP was investigated to test the concordance of IUCN zones with demographic units that have conservation value. A zebra shark specific microsatellite library was developed consisting of 14 polymorphic loci of which 13 were employed for the population genetic analysis along with mitochondrial ND4 sequence data. Mitochondrial and microsatellite data-sets from samples collected throughout northern Australia and south-east Asia concord with the regional IUCN classifications. However, evidence of genetic subdivision was found within these regions, including subdivision between locations connected by habitat suitable for migration. Further, parametric FST analyses and Bayesian clustering analyses indicated the primary genetic break within the IWP is not represented by the IUCN classifications but rather is congruent with the Indonesian throughflow current. This study has demonstrated that zebra sharks form a large, predictable, shallow coastal aggregation comprised entirely of mature adults as well as display high genetic subdivision in the Indo-West Pacific region with little to no recruitment into over-exploited populations from healthy populations. These findings indicate that, if zebra sharks form similar aggregations as that which occurs at The Group in regions of high fishing pressure then, without sufficient protection and management localised depletion and extirpation will eventuate for zebra shark populations in heavily-fished areas.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">zebra Shark</field><field name="subject">leopard shark</field><field name="subject">Stegostoma fasciatum</field><field name="subject">seasonal aggregation</field><field name="subject">photo-identification</field><field name="subject">passive acoustic telemetry</field><field name="subject">population genetics</field><field name="subject">Indo-West Pacific</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178909</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pregnancy Pocketbook: Improving pregnancy health behaviours in a disadvantaged community</field><field name="creator">Shelley Wilkinson</field><field name="description">Context Current care guidelines recommend that pregnant women receive advice about the important health behaviours which may influence pregnancy outcomes. These behaviours are associated with pregnancy-related and long-term health outcomes for both the mother and infant. Poor pregnancy outcomes can result in increased costs of health care delivery through longer hospital admissions and intensive care admissions. Although provision of behavioural advice to pregnant women is recommended, most educational materials provide limited and inconsistent information. There is a clear need for widespread delivery of evidence-based information and skill-development strategies to influence pregnancy health behaviours. One avenue of information is via the pregnancy health records (PHRs) provided by maternity health services that women carry for the duration of their pregnancy. Objective My research sought to develop, implement, and evaluate a handheld health record for use in pregnancy (the &#8220;Pregnancy Pocketbook&#8221;) in an urban population of women with a high proportion of disadvantaged women. Study Overview My research comprised two phases, a development phase, and an implementation and evaluation phase. I identified specific behaviours (cigarette smoking, fruit and vegetable intake, and physical activity) requiring intervention and reviewed evidence-based frameworks, behaviour change theories, and guidelines for the presentation of written information to support behaviour change. I developed and refined the Pregnancy Pocketbook through a number of studies. Studies 1, 2, and 3 The Pregnancy Pocketbook was refined through a qualitative evaluation of a PHR enhanced with behaviour change tools (Study 1), focus groups held with women from the target group to investigate PHR preferences (Study 2), and strategy testing of the Pregnancy Pocketbook activities with women from the target group (Study 3). The focus group results combined with those from the qualitative evaluation suggested the Pregnancy Pocketbook should be a women-held, woman-focussed resource providing essential and comprehensive information on recommended pregnancy health behaviours. It should include tools to facilitate appropriate behaviour changes and tools for women to monitor pregnancy progress and record questions and notes to facilitate communication with their health carers. Strategy testing demonstrated that the Pregnancy Pocketbook content, screening questions and activities were well received by a small sample of women, with minor changes made following testing to improve the understanding and usability of the various sections of the Pregnancy Pocketbook. The final intervention (Study 4) The final version of the Pregnancy Pocketbook was a 73-page interactive resource, designed to be used according to the 5As self-management framework (Assess, Advise, Agree, Assist, Arrange), with screening tools, information, goal setting and self-monitoring activities with information for further referral for greater support when required. It was presented in an A5 plastic ring-bound folder, with dividers, labelled &#8216;Your health goals&#8217;, &#8216;Tracking your health goals&#8217;, &#8216;Your first antenatal visit&#8217;, &#8216;Pregnancy progress&#8217;, &#8216;Birth summary&#8217;, &#8216;Glossary&#8217;, and &#8216;Emergency contacts and general numbers&#8217;. The Pocketbook was evaluated using a quasi-experimental two-group design. Women were recruited from two antenatal clinics within the same health service district. Women received the PP during their first antenatal clinic appointment in one clinic (PP:n = 163) and women in the other clinic received usual care (UC: n = 141). Smoking, fruit and vegetable intake, and physical activity were assessed at baseline (service entry), 12-weeks post-service-entry and 24 weeks post-service-entry. Behaviour-specific self-efficacy was also measured during pregnancy. I also assessed the PP implementation process through adherence of the staff and organisation to planned implementation processes. Results At 12-weeks post-service-entry, a significantly greater proportion of women in the Pregnancy Pocketbook (PP) group had stopped smoking (7.6% vs 2.1%), compared with the Usual Care (UC) group, p &lt;0.05. There was a net (non-significant) increase of 5% more women meeting physical activity guidelines (PP: 1.2% increase vs. UC: 3.5% decrease) and a net 20 minute difference in median minutes of physical activity (PP: 10 minute increase vs. UC: 10 minute decrease). Both groups increased their fruit and vegetable intake. Approximately two-thirds of women reported receiving the Pregnancy Pocketbook, many without introduction or explanation. Few women completed sections of the Pregnancy Pocketbook that required health professional assistance, suggesting minimal interaction about the resource between health staff and the women in their care. Conclusion and future recommendations There were low levels of adherence to health behaviour recommendations for pregnancy in this sample. The Pregnancy Pocketbook produced significant effects on smoking cessation, even under limited delivery conditions. A refocus of antenatal care towards primary prevention is required to more consistently provide essential health information and behaviour change tools for improved maternal and infant pregnancy health outcomes. Future studies must include process evaluations and apply the theory of dissemination to enhance uptake of the interventions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">antenatal</field><field name="subject">health behaviours</field><field name="subject">behaviour change</field><field name="subject">pregnancy</field><field name="subject">handheld records</field><field name="subject">self-management</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178921</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding the mechanisms behind invasion to improve the efficacy of control strategies</field><field name="creator">Jennifer Firn</field><field name="description">Abstract The negative impact of invasive plant species on biodiversity and ecosystem functions, such as productivity and nutrient cycling has been deemed a global epidemic. To address this worldwide concern, information is needed on how the invasion process happens and how to control an existing invasion. The main aim of the research presented in this thesis was to develop a better understanding of the interacting role different mechanisms play in facilitating invasion and then link this understanding to the design of more effective control strategies. This aim is significant because traditional weed control strategies are not working. The estimated cost of controlling weeds in Australia is $1.4 billion per year in agricultural landscapes. Despite this substantial investment, invasive weed species are estimated to continue to cost the agricultural industry $2.2 billion per year in loss of yield. Current control strategies tend to focus on killing or removing an invasive plant species directly with the application of herbicides and/or mechanical removal. These strategies have proven ineffectual because the plant communities that assemble after management often remain dominated by the same invader or another. In this thesis, I use a combination of empirical and modelling techniques to investigate how disturbance regimes and competitive interactions between invasive plants and native plants can be manipulated to improve the efficacy of restoration efforts. To do this, I use the model scenario of the invasion of Eragrostis curvula (African lovegrass), an invasive grass species introduced into Australia in the early 1900s from South Africa. This species has now spread into every Australian state and territory (chapter 2). I specifically focus on two mechanisms: (1) disturbance, i.e. cattle grazing, and (2) competitive interactions. In chapter 3, I examine connections between dominance and competitive differences among African lovegrass and several functionally similar native grass species in a pasture community. To test the displacement hypothesis, I used a glasshouse competition trial to investigate interactions between African lovegrass and two non-persisting native grass species (Themeda australis and Bothriochloa decipiens) with manipulations of resources, neighbour density, and establishment order. To test the partitioning hypothesis, I compared in situ water use patterns among African lovegrass and two coexisting native grass species (Aristida calycina and Aristida personata) based on the assumption that water is the most limiting resource in this system. The key finding of this chapter is that competition can have important, but contingent, impacts on dominance. Competitive differences appear to partially contribute to abundance patterns after establishment, but may be relatively unimportant during the establishment phase where disturbance appears more critical. In chapter 4, I provide evidence that the identification of mechanisms that led to an invasion, while crucial for the development of effective preventative measures and understanding the invasion process, may not be necessary for the design of more effective control strategies. To examine the effects of different control strategies on African lovegrass and the resultant community, I established a large factorial field-trial with a split-plot design. I manipulated grazing, soil nutrient levels and the presence of the invader. The most common control strategy (removing the causal disturbance and killing the invasive grass), based implicitly on traditional equilibrium models, was not an effective option for restoring a desirable native community. Instead, this strategy led to the dominance of a secondary invader. The most effective control strategy was based on alternative stable states models and involved maintaining grazing, and increasing the palatability of the invader with fertilizers. The key finding of this chapter is that novel approaches for control, which consider the dynamics of the invader-dominated system, are needed. In chapter 5, I investigate the benefits of explicitly incorporating actions that manipulate disturbance (natural or imposed) into control efforts. To do this, I first developed a process model that described the dynamics of an invader whose establishment is preferentially favoured by disturbance. I then couched this model in a decision theory framework, a stochastic dynamic program, and applied a case-study of another invasive plant species, Mimosa pigra (a perennial legume shrub and pan-tropical weed). The key finding of this chapter is that strategies should not only focus on existing invader-dominated sites, but should also protect sites occupied by native species from disturbances that facilitate invasion. The research discussed in this thesis makes three key contributions to a better understanding of the invasion process and the design of more effective control strategies: 1) the search for one key mechanism is not sufficient because multiple mechanisms can interact or shift in importance to facilitate different stages of invasion, 2) a novel approach is needed to restore a more desirable native community because the dynamics of the invader-dominated system can differ from the historical native community, and 3) control efforts should be broadened in focus to include protection of the integrity of native communities from disturbances that facilitate invasion.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">alternative stable states models</field><field name="subject">novel ecosystems</field><field name="subject">selective grazing</field><field name="subject">intraspecific and interspecific competition</field><field name="subject">integrated weed management</field><field name="subject">stochastic dynamic programming</field><field name="subject">population dynamics</field><field name="subject">niche partitioning</field><field name="subject">co-existence</field><field name="subject">competitive effect and response</field><field name="subject">pulsed rainfall</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178924</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ambushers or Sponsors? An Examination of Sponsorship Linked Advertising.</field><field name="creator">Sarah Kelly</field><field name="description">This research proposes that a construct called Sponsorship Linked Advertising (SLA) is valuable in understanding how brand and corporate advertising link to sponsorship and event marketing. SLA includes both ads that communicate a link to a sponsored event (tiedness) and those that demonstrate, through their overall design, an event&#8217;s motif or theme (themedness). In its themed form, SLA differs from creative advertising by virtue of the fact that creative advertising can exist independent of any sponsorship link, whereas sponsorship linked advertisements intentionally unite a sponsorship and an event either implicitly and/or explicitly. With sponsorship investment estimated to be $45.2 billion worldwide (International Events Group 2009) and leverage advertising (i.e., advertising that is employed to heighten awareness of sponsorships or better articulate sponsor-event links) reflecting a similar amount, empirical examination, validation and implementation guidance of SLA as a leveraging strategy is critical. The unique marketing opportunities associated with popular sporting, charitable and arts events also attract non-sponsoring companies which also seek to affiliate with the event, an activity known as ambushing (McKelvey and Grady 2008). Examination of SLA is therefore important in an increasingly competitive and cluttered global sponsorship arena, in which ambushing is becoming a pervasive practice, attracting considerable attention from event organisers, sponsors and policy makers alike, while also detracting from or diluting intended sponsorship communications. Despite widespread use of SLA, no empirical validation of this strategy has been undertaken to date. The present research addresses this gap. Initially, the SLA construct is defined, categorised, and measured through content analysis, then a series of experimental studies are used to achieve empirical validation of the SLA construct. Streams of sponsorship and advertising effectiveness research, along with theories of associative learning, attribution and persuasion, are used to guide examination of SLA effectiveness in new empirical work. Specifically, a series of experiments are used to examine consumers&#8217; cognitive, affective and behavioural responses to SLA. The first experimental study tests a main effect of ad type as well as interactive effects of tiedness and themedness with sponsorship availability (i.e., knowledge of true sponsor) on outcomes including nature and type of thoughts elicited, ad scepticism and sponsor motive attributions. Findings from this study suggest that SLA exposure induces more positive thoughts, less ad scepticism and more favourable attributions than exposure to Non SLA. These results provide initial evidence that consumers process SLA differently to other ad types and interestingly, may derive enjoyment from, or at least exhibit less ad scepticism towards viewing SLA. Finally, the influence of competitive context on sponsor recall is tested by simulating exposure to ambush and/or SLA ad types following a sponsorship announcement. Findings provide evidence to support a memory interference hypothesis and imply that accuracy of sponsor recall is diminished by presence of an ambush ad, but that this effect is moderated by presence of SLA leveraging a previously announced sponsorship. Taken together, the results of this series of studies provide an empirical measurement of SLA strategy and demonstrate construct validity. Further, interpretation of the results gives rise to specific creative strategies for practical implementation. Ecological validity is built into the design by using real events within ad stimuli and investigating SLA in the competitive context in which it occurs. Hence, the results are said to be generalisable to real-world situations, and the resultant creative strategies are arguably contextually valid. This research contributes to existing marketing and sponsorship literature by proposing and empirically validating a new construct. Theoretically, it examines consumer response to SLA by combining information processing and resistance based perspectives. It extends traditional views of ambushing by offering empirical evidence of the practice being widespread and extending to low level sponsors and event &#8220;free riders&#8221;. Practical implications of this research extend to advertisers and sponsors faced with the challenge of effectively leveraging huge sponsorship investments and assessing return on such investment. Empirical testing of ambushing effects has important implications for the debate on increased regulatory intervention of such practices, a debate centred upon tension between balancing fair marketing practice with the rights of sponsors and event organisers.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="subject">Marketing, Advertising, Sponsorship, Ambushing, Content analysis, Experimental Method, Consumer skepticism, Memory interference.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178925</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a Novel Methodology for the Delivery of DNA Vaccines using the Herpesvirus Protein VP22</field><field name="creator">Kerri Clark</field><field name="description">Bovine herpesvirus-1 (BoHV-1) is associated with the syndrome bovine respiratory disease, which is the major cause of morbidity and mortality within feedlots in Australia and around the world. Currently there are no vaccines that completely prevent BoHV-1 infections and viral shedding. The most efficacious vaccines used are live attenuated which have the potential to revert to wild type and cause disease. DNA vaccines are ideal vaccine candidates as they not only induce humoral and cellular immunity, they are also inexpensive and easy to produce. However, DNA vaccines although efficacious in small animal models have not yielded similar success in large animals. The inconsistent translation of DNA vaccines to large animal models, including cattle, has been associated with poor delivery of the vaccine to the nuclei of cells which is required for antigen transcription. Recently, the human herpesvirus-1 protein VP22 (hVP22) was demonstrated to exhibit the uncommon capacity to spread intercellularly from the cell of expression to the nuclei of neighbouring cells in a golgi and energy independent process. This process was very efficient with hVP22 being identified in all cells of a monolayer after transfection. hVP22 was quickly used to promote the efficiency of DNA vaccines by fusing the hVP22 gene with antigen genes in the vaccine resulting in the increased delivery of the antigenic protein to neighbouring cells. The fusion protein was subsequently degraded and presented as peptides on the cell surface in association with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules that lead to an increase in fusion protein specific antibody production. This pathway, although successful augmenting the humoral response, did not increase the amount of antigen presented on MHC class I molecules which is essential for protection against intracellular pathogens. This thesis describes the development of a methodology whereby VP22, fused to a DNA binding protein, was hypothesised to increase the number of cells the DNA vaccine was delivered to and then to facilitate the transport of the DNA vaccine to their nuclei. A homologue of hVP22 has been identified in BoHV-1 and the capacity of the BoHV-1 protein to spread intercellularly and localise in the nuclei of cells was determined in this thesis using a novel and definitive model. Although retaining similar translocation capabilities to hVP22 the BoHV-1 VP22 homologue could not be expressed in bacteria and was subsequently not able to be used to demonstrate the proposed vaccine concept. hVP22 instead was fused to the DNA binding protein, Gal4, for bacterial expression. The purified fusion protein was demonstrated to bind not only oligonucleotides encoding the Gal4 binding sequence but also to a model DNA vaccine encoding Gal4 binding sequences in vitro. However, application of the hVP22 fusion protein:vaccine complex alone or condensed with poly-L-lysine to mammalian cells did not promote the delivery of the DNA vaccine to the nuclei of cells. As part of the DNA vaccine development for BoHV-1 the first nucleotide sequence of the Unique Short region of the Australian BoHV-1 strain V155 (8925 nucleotides) was determined. The sequence information generated permitted insights into epitopes contained within BoHV-1 antigens, particularly glycoprotein D which has been identified as the most appropriate glycoprotein for the purpose of vaccination. Furthermore, comparison of the Unique Short sequence variations between different subtypes of BoHV-1 provided molecular data that may be associated with the observed variation in virulence. Further optimisation of the methodology described in this study is required to facilitate the delivery of the DNA vaccine into cells by the VP22 fusion protein. The future development of strategies that utilise polypeptides to augment delivery of DNA vaccines into cells and then to facilitate the transport of the vaccine to the nuclei of cells, resulting in increased antigen expression, may ultimately lead to the successful application of this vaccine technology in animal models.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bovine, herpesvirus, VP22, DNA vaccine</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178927</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sociology of language learning: Social biographies and school English achievement in rural Bangladesh</field><field name="creator">Md Obaidul Hamid</field><field name="description">The &#8216;social turn&#8217; in applied linguistics and second language acquisition (SLA) has seen the emergence of a range of socially-oriented perspectives, such as sociolinguistic, sociocultural, socio-historical and situated learning, yet this has not resulted in L2 learners&#8217; social origins and backgrounds being given sufficient attention in L2 research. The present study therefore argues for taking a sociology of language learning perspective to investigate L2 learners&#8217; social biographies and their academic achievement in English. This social perspective is informed by the sociology of education as well as critical approaches to applied linguistics. Learners&#8217; social biographies consist of learner-internal (personal) and -external (social) factors. These factors are conceptualised as learner habitus and family educational capital (economic, social and cultural) respectively, with reference to Bourdieu&#8217;s theories in the sociology of education. The study investigates secondary school students&#8217; English learning outcomes in relation to their habitus and family capital situations in a rural context in Bangladesh. It uses a mixed methods research design and draws on both quantitative and qualitative data. It also utilises multiple perspectives, provided by 10th grade students (n = 228) and their English teachers, head teachers and parents. The data collection instruments include a questionnaire survey, an English proficiency test and participant interviews. The study shows that aspects of family economic and cultural capital and learner habitus are significantly associated with the students&#8217; English achievement. However, social capital, operationalised as parental input into the students&#8217; English studies, is not associated with their academic achievement in English, although it is significantly correlated with learner habitus and parental education. The students&#8217; perceptions of their family capital situations and the perceived impact of these situations on their academic experience were supportive of structuralist determinism. Despite the constraining effects of family capital disadvantage on academic experience, disadvantaged students can neutralise these effects by means of their habitus and thus negate social determinism in the context of their scholastic achievement. The study also shows that contrary to the widening gap in the academic achievement of students in favour of females in many social contexts, the female students in the present context performed somewhat less well than their male counterparts in the school-leaving examination. Finally, the students&#8217; English learning and academic outcomes were embedded in their social biographies. Their academic achievement or underachievement cannot be fully understood without recourse to their familial and social worlds, their lived experiences, their desires for better futures and their disadvantage, and lack of means to pursue those desires.Despite some caveats, the findings have important implications for the theory and practice of teaching English in Bangladesh and other social contexts. First, it is necessary to include both learner-internal and -external family/social factors in the investigation of L2 learners&#8217; English learning experience and outcomes. Second, ELT policies should have provisions that address these beyond-the-school factors in order to develop English language skills across social classes and geographic locations. Finally, schools should embrace the question of inequality in English learning outcomes and devise mechanisms for the reduction of inequalities within their limited resources and capacities. The major contribution of the study is to our understanding of the factors associated with English language learning in rural communities in developing societies. In particular, the study substantiates non-cognitive, non-methodological and non-curricular approaches to EFL/ESL. Identification of these factors is facilitated by the perspective of sociology of English learning and the concept of social biography. In addition, the study designs a theoretical and conceptual framework and instruments for researching student achievement in English in relation to family capital and learner habitus.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English achievement, social biography, family capital, habitus, gender, ESL/EFL, mixed methods, L2 policy and planning, sociology of language learning, Bangladesh</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178929</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Where We Cannot Speak</field><field name="creator">Gary Maller</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT WHERE WE CANNOT SPEAK The poetry collection Where We Cannot Speak and the accompanying critical essay &#8220;Borges and the Golem Paradox: a Rhetoric of Silence?&#8221; explore the theme of language and silence. The poetry collection is written in the voice of the imaginary (but published) poet, Gershon Holtz, who reflects my Jewish heritage and upbringing. The poems articulate the silences of those oppressed by war and persecution, and also the silences of meditation and the ineffable, which can reside in the presence, absence, and margins of the poet&#8217;s voice. The collection is comprised of two sections: (i) &#8220;The Mantelpiece&#8221;, which delves into culture, conflict, and memory; and (ii) &#8220;The Beautiful Salon&#8221;, which reflects upon themes of place, time, loss, and responses to silences represented in visual art and poetry. The critical essay is concerned with the cabalistic figure of the golem&#8212;a human being made in an artificial way by magic art, through the use of holy names. Argentinean writer Jorge Luis Borges (famous for creating fictitious authors and books) wished that, of all his work, the first stanza of his poem &#8220;The Golem&#8221;, might be remembered. The essay provides a reading that demonstrates how the poem embodies Borges&#8217; views on the nature of signification, language, and knowledge. The paradoxical outcome is that, just as the golem did not have the power of speech, language conceived of as an instrument for textual golem-making is silent in its capacity to represent the world. The essay concludes with some thoughts on my own poetic practice and links the essay with the poetry collection via the figure of the textual golem, Gershon Holtz. This fictional poet becomes a symbol for the problem of language and representation&#8212;interpreted both as what we cannot speak about, and the silences inherent in language itself.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rhetoric</field><field name="subject">silence</field><field name="subject">ineffabillity</field><field name="subject">signification</field><field name="subject">Jorge Luis Borges</field><field name="subject">Cratylus</field><field name="subject">Cabbala</field><field name="subject">golem</field><field name="subject">the Liar Paradox</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178932</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visual Planning and Exterior Furnishing: A Critical History of the Early Townscape Movement, 1930 to 1949.</field><field name="creator">Mathew Aitchison</field><field name="description">Among the many and varied episodes in the history of twentieth century architecture and urban planning, the British Townscape movement is usually associated with the rear guards of these fields; both conservative and nostalgic. If mentioned at all, historical accounts generally portray Townscape as a brief and sometimes necessary interlude to subsequent movements of greater consequence. This reception is due, in part, to contemporary movements such as the so-called &#8216;New Urbanism&#8217;, through which the more culturally conservative aspects of Townscape&#8217;s doctrine continue to persist, arguably masking and debasing an earlier and largely forgotten Townscape, originally intended to be modernist, visually striking and to challenge notions of tradition and taste in architectural and urban discourses. The following thesis proposes that Townscape&#8217;s contributions to the discourses and practices of the twentieth century are far more considerable than has been held to date. In its early phase, Townscape introduced several important conceptual innovations whose influence can still be felt within contemporary discourses, such as: &#8216;contextual&#8217; or site specific design practice; comprehensive urban design, regardless of scale or disciplinarian frameworks; the insistence on the inclusion of historic buildings and urban fabric; and its promotion of a more scenographic, synthetic, compromised and pluralist approach, which resulted in informal, irregular and asymmetrical design solutions in architecture and urban planning. From today&#8217;s standpoint Townscape has historical interest, standing at the junction of some of the greater developments in architecture and urban planning, such as the transition from architectural modernism to post-modernism, and the rise of &#8216;urbanism&#8217; and its positioning as the supreme question of architecture in the post-war period by architectural movements such as contextualism, neo-rationalism and post-modernism more generally. This thesis proposes that Townscape&#8217;s influence on these movements and their authors was far more substantial than is generally acknowledged. In architecture, personalities such as Colin Rowe, Leon and Rob Krier, Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown, and Alison and Peter Smithson can be counted among those reacting to and to some degree influenced by the movement. In urban planning discourses, prominent reformists such as Jane Jacobs, Kevin Lynch and Christopher Tunnard also appear to have drawn on Townscape&#8217;s lessons in their criticism. In revisiting Townscape it is hoped that not only can a fairer and fuller picture of the movement emerge, but the scale and duration of the movement and the roles of its initiators and various supporters be duly appreciated. A thorough survey of the Architectural Review from 1930 to the 1980s shows some 1,400 articles relating to Townscape&#8217;s campaign, most of which have hitherto gone unnoticed in the scholarship on the period. These were contributed by around 200 authors, many of whom are rarely associated with the movement. This survey also reveals that most of the concepts and the rhetoric of Townscape was set much earlier than is usually thought, from the late 1930s to the early 1950s, that its intended scope was much more extensive than commonly held, and that it was planned, initiated and directed by Nikolaus Pevsner (1902-1983) and Hubert de Cronin Hastings (1902-1986). Both Pevsner and Hastings were occupied with Townscape throughout the 1940s and variously referred to the movement as &#8216;Visual Planning&#8217; and &#8216;Exterior Furnishing&#8217;, which was more widely understood to relate to the picturesque revival carried out largely under Pevsner&#8217;s name in the Architectural Review. Throughout the 1940s Pevsner published extensively on the subject, while Hastings anonymously and pseudononymously directed discussion on the movement as executive editor of the Architectural Review, as well as from the less prominent position as proprietor of the influential Architectural Press. It is this body of work, its authors and its associated discourses that are the focus of the present enquiry. An analysis of these publications and their authors promises new insights into the early phase of the Townscape movement: its sources, originality, theory, objectives, and its influence and legacy in the practice and discourses of today. As an early reform movement of modernism, the view of Townscape put forward in this thesis challenges current historiographies, which tend to marginalize the movement&#8217;s position in the period. In its early phase Townscape was starkly modernist, but it contained much of the critique later taken up within the architectural urbanism of the 1960s and 1970s and can be seen as an important percussor to post-modernism. Additionally, Townscape&#8217;s particular approach to architecture and urban design reveals a greater value in contemporary discourses; one founded in its stylistic pluralism, its undogmatic interpretation of modernism, its insistence on historical and cultural continuity, its attention to the visual aspects and heterogeneity of the built environment, along with an aesthetic based on compromise, synthesis and inclusion.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="subject">architecture</field><field name="subject">urban design</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178934</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of intertidal marine reserves &#8211; using habitat types to identify areas of high conservation value</field><field name="creator">Simon Banks</field><field name="description">The goal of biodiversity conservation has been described as the conservation of diversity at three levels: ecosystem, species and genetic diversity. Developing a representative system of marine protected areas is considered an effective way to achieve this goal in the marine environment. The growing concern associated with threats to the marine environment has resulted in an increased demand for marine reserves (i.e. no-take areas) that conserve representative and adequate examples of biodiversity. Often, the decisions about where to locate reserves must be made in the absence of detailed information on the patterns of distribution of the biota. Alternative approaches are required that include defining habitats as surrogates for biodiversity. The development of biodiversity surrogates at fine-scales (i.e. habitats) will have an increasingly important role in the identification of sites that will contribute to a representative system of marine protected areas. This is because it will increase the likelihood that the system will adequately achieve biodiversity objectives by ensuring protection of a greater range of habitats and species. Surrogate measures of biodiversity enable decisions about where to locate marine reserves to be made more reliably in the absence of detailed data on the distribution of species. There is concern, however, about the reliability of surrogate measures to represent biotic diversity and the use of such measures in the design of marine reserve systems. Currently, surrogate measures are most often based on broad-scale (100s to 1000s of kilometres) bioregional frameworks that define general categories (sandy beach, rocky shore) for intertidal systems. These broad-scale categories are inadequate when making decisions about conservation priorities at the local level (10s to 100s of metres). This study provides an explanation of an intertidal shoreline habitat surrogate (i.e. shoreline types) used to describe 24,216 kilometres of Queensland&#8217;s coastline. The protective status of shoreline types was evaluated to assist with designing a representative system of intertidal marine protected areas. The shoreline types derived using physical properties of the shoreline were used as a surrogate for intertidal biodiversity to assist with the identification of sites for inclusion in a candidate system of intertidal marine reserves for 17,463 kilometres of the mainland coast of Queensland, Australia. This represents the first systematic approach, on essentially one-dimensional data, using fine-scale (10s to 100s of metres) intertidal habitats to identify a system of marine reserves for such a large length of coast. A range of solutions would provide for the protection of a representative example of shoreline types in Queensland. Shoreline types were used as a surrogate for intertidal biodiversity (i.e. habitats, microhabitats) to assist with the identification of sites to be included in a representative system of marine reserves in south east Queensland. The use of local-scale shoreline types increased the likelihood that sites identified for conservation achieved representation goals for the mosaic of habitats and microhabitats, and therefore the associated biodiversity present on rocky shores, than that provided by the existing marine reserve protection in south east Queensland. These results indicate that using broad-scale surrogate measures (rocky shore, sandy beach) for biodiversity (habitats, microhabitats and species) are likely to result in poor representation of fine-scale habitats and microhabitats, and therefore intertidal assemblages in marine reserves. When additional fine-scale data were added to reserve selection the summed irreplaceability of 24% (for spatial extent of habitats), and 29% (for presence/absence of microhabitats) of rocky shore sites increased above zero, where a value close to one means a site is necessary, for inclusion in a reserve system, to meet conservation targets. The use of finer-scale physical data to support marine reserve design is more likely to result in the selection of reserves that achieve representation at habitat and microhabitat levels, increasing the likelihood that conservation goals will be achieved. The design and planning of marine and terrestrial protected areas systems should not be undertaken independently of each other because it is likely to lead to inadequate representation of intertidal habitats in either system. The development of reserve systems specially designed to protect intertidal habitats should be integrated into the design of terrestrial and marine protected area systems. Marine reserve networks are a necessary and effective tool for conserving marine biodiversity. They also have an important role in the governance of oceans and the sustainable management of marine resources. The translation of marine reserve network theory into practice is a challenge for conservation practitioners. Barriers to implementing marine reserves include varying levels of political will and agency support and leadership, poorly coordinated marine conservation policy, inconsistencies with the use of legislation, polarised views and opposition from some stakeholders, and difficulties with defining and mapping conservation features. The future success of marine reserve network implementation will become increasingly dependent on: increasing political commitment and agency leadership to remove conflicts within and between government agencies involved in site identification and selection; greater involvement and collaboration with stakeholders; and the provision of resources to define and map conservation features. Key elements of translating marine reserve theory into implementation of a network of marine reserves are discussed based on approaches used successfully in New Zealand and New South Wales (Australia).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intertidal habitats, conservation planning, marine reserves, microhabitats, reserve design, rocky shore, siting algorithm</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178936</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Particle-droplet collisions in spray drying</field><field name="creator">Martijn van der Hoeven</field><field name="description">Spray drying is a widely used unit operation for producing particulate products directly from a liquid feed. Important processes that occur inside the spray dryer are droplet formation, droplet drying and interactions between droplets and recycled fines. Various studies have looked at the first two processes, but the latter phenomenon has received less attention. Literature on droplet-particle interaction which aims at quantitatively describing agglomeration in spray drying is scarce and mainly qualitative. For product quality the formation of agglomerates is often desirable. This thesis models and investigates the collisions of individual particles with single droplets. The surface tack of drying droplets has been identified as an important variable for the formation of agglomerates. In this thesis a novel method for measuring tack from the liquid phase has been further improved. The improvements are a more accurate load measurement, an automated control of the tack probe and an improved layout of the sample holder and probe. The key feature of the device is its ability to measure tack of drying droplets, whereas other devices measure tack by wetting a powder. Using our method the tack of a commonly spray dried product, yeast extract, has been measured. From these experiments it was found that with decreasing average moisture content the surface tack increases to a maximum. Below a critical average moisture content the surface of the droplet is dry and the tack rapidly decreases upon further drying. Another important parameter in determining the degree of agglomeration is the degree of penetration. If the particle penetrates the droplet too deeply, the agglomerate structure becomes too dense. To predict the penetration depth, a non-dimensional model has been developed. It describes the penetration of a particle into a liquid droplet during a head-on collision. It is based on a force balance and incorporates surface tension force, viscous force and capillary pressure force. The important parameters determining the collision outcome are the contact angle, the size of the droplet relative to the particle, the Reynolds and Weber numbers. For each contact angle an equilibrium penetration position exists, at this point the surface tension force vector is perpendicular to the penetration direction. Five different penetrations regimes are identified. At low Reynolds numbers, viscous forces dominate and the particle asymptotically travels towards the equilibrium position. Reducing the viscous drag force by increasing the Reynolds number results in initially overshooting the equilibrium position, but the surface tension force pulls the particle back, to attain the equilibrium in an oscillating motion. At even higher Reynolds numbers the particle fully penetrates the droplet, and reaches the centre of the droplet for even higher values for the Reynolds number. The ejection regime is found at high Reynolds number and low Weber numbers and the liquid should be non-wetting. Using the regime maps one is able to identify in which region a spray dryer is operating. Although the full penetration regimes are useful for capturing fines, it should be avoided when agglomeration is desired. The ejection regime should be avoided as well. To validate the model, impact experiments were carried out by dropping glass spheres on the surface of different liquids. These validation experiments were the first attempt to experimentally validate the collision of a single particle with a liquid surface. Besides yeast extract, which has non-Newtonian rheological properties, silicone oils with constant viscosities of 100 mPa&#8226;s and 1 Pa&#8226;s have been tested. The penetration over time for different impact velocities was determined by analysing high speed camera recordings. The typical penetration times ranged from 0.2 s to 2 s. To obtain accurate location data was recorded at frame rates up to 38 000 frames per second. Glass spheres, with a size of 2 mm were used to allow the visual tracking. Modelling the impacts showed that the model consistently predicted faster penetration times than were observed experimentally. The relative difference increased with increasing viscosity. A parameter fitting exercise showed that better agreement could be obtained by using a higher viscosity and a higher contact angle in the model. With this knowledge the most likely factor influencing the model-experiment mismatch was identified as being the dynamics of wetting of the particle surface. It was also found that using the dynamic contact angle in the model would improve its results. The non-Newtonian characteristics of the yeast extract resulted in the particle rebound and the formation of an air cavity upon impact. The tack measurement technique and penetration model presented in this thesis will be useful tools for the design of spray dryers. Recommendations are made for further model improvement. The experimental validation is the first attempt to validate the presented model. Future improvements are recommended and suggestions are presented.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spray dyring</field><field name="subject">tack</field><field name="subject">stickiness</field><field name="subject">droplet drying</field><field name="subject">binary collisions</field><field name="subject">particle impacts</field><field name="subject">agglomeration</field><field name="subject">particle-droplet collisions</field><field name="subject">particle penetration</field><field name="subject">collision regime map</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178950</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation into the Molecular Pharmacology of &#945;1 and &#945;3 Glycine Receptors</field><field name="creator">Xuebin Chen</field><field name="description">The glycine receptor (GlyR) mediates fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system (CNS). Although GlyR &#945;1 subunits are widely distributed, &#945;3 subunits are found only on spinal cord pain sensory neurons where they mediate central inflammatory pain sensitization. Thus, the &#945;3 subunit is a potential therapeutic target for anti-inflammatory analgesia. It is yet to be understood why &#945;3 subunits are represented in these synapses. Thus, &#945;3 subunit-specific modulators are required both as therapeutic leads and as pharmacological probes for basic research. The Thesis, which consists of three independent studies, investigated the molecular pharmacology of three classes of compounds at GlyRs, especially those containing the &#945;3 subunit. The dihydropyridines (DHPs), nifedipine and nicardipine, modulate native GlyRs at micromolar concentrations. Nicardipine has a biphasic potentiating and inhibitory effect, whereas nifedipine causes inhibition only. The first study investigated the molecular mechanism by which these compounds inhibit recombinant GlyRs. The rate of onset of inhibition in the open state was accelerated by pre-application of DHP in the closed state, with the degree of acceleration proportional to the concentration of pre-applied DHP. This implies a non-inhibitory binding site close to the DHP inhibitory site. DHP inhibition was use-dependent and independent of glycine concentration, consistent with a pore-blocking mode of action. DHP sensitivity was abolished by the G2&#8217;A mutation, providing a strong case for DHP binding site in the pore. Nifedipine exhibited an approximately 10-fold higher inhibitory potency at &#945;1-containing relative to &#945;3-containing receptors, whereas nicardipine was only weakly selective for &#945;1-containing GlyRs. The differential sensitivities of nifedipine and nicardipine for different GlyR isoforms suggest that DHPs may be a useful resource to screen as pharmacological tools for selectively inhibiting different synaptic GlyR isoforms. To date there are few compounds known to pharmacologically discriminate between &#945;1 and &#945;3 subunit-containing GlyRs. The second study stemmed from an observation that &#946;-alanine and taurine act as weak partial agonists of &#945;3 GlyRs but as strong partial agonists at &#945;1 GlyRs. Using chimeras of &#945;1 and &#945;3 subunits, we identified the relatively structurally divergent M4 transmembrane domain and C-terminal tail as a specific determinant of the efficacy difference. As mutation of individual non-conserved M4 residues had little influence on agonist efficacies, the reduced efficacy of &#945;3 GlyRs is most likely a distributed effect of all non-conserved M4 residues. Given the lack of contact between M4 and other transmembrane domains, the efficacy differences are probably mediated by differential interactions between the respective M4 domains and the surrounding lipid environment. The strong influence of M4 primary structure on partial agonist efficacy suggests that the relatively poorly conserved &#945;3 GlyR M4 domain may be a promising domain to target in the search for &#945;3 GlyR-specific modulators. &#946;-carbolines have recently been shown to inhibit glycine receptors in a subunit-specific manner. The third study screened four structurally similar &#946;-carbolines, harmane (HM), tryptoline (TP), norharmane (NHM) and 6-methoxyharmalan (MH) at recombinantly expressed &#945;1, &#945;1&#946;, &#945;2 and &#945;3 glycine receptors. The four compounds exhibited only weak subunit-specificity, rendering them unsuitable as pharmacological probes. Because they displayed competitive antagonist activity, we investigated the roles of known glycine binding residues in coordinating the four compounds. The structural similarity of the compounds, coupled with the differential effects of C-loop mutations (T204A, F207Y) on compound potency, implied direct interactions between variable &#946;-carboline groups and mutated residues. Mutant cycle analysis employing HM and NHM revealed a strong pairwise interaction between the HM methyl group and the C-loop in the region T204 and F207. These results, which define the orientation of the bound &#946;-carbolines, were supported by molecular docking simulations. The information may also be relevant to understanding the mechanism of &#946;-carboline binding to GABAAR where they are potent pharmacological probes. The identification of compounds that specifically abolish &#945;3 GlyR-mediated currents should provide a useful means to investigate the physiological roles of this subunit. Drugs that potently and selectively enhance &#945;3-subtype GlyR function may potentially serve as lead compounds since &#945;3-subtype GlyRs have emerged as a potential therapeutic target for pain treatment. Results from studies forming the Thesis have identified several structural elements that might be useful for developing novel &#945;3 subunit-specific drugs in the future.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ligand-gated Ion Channel</field><field name="subject">Glycine Receptor</field><field name="subject">Pharmacology</field><field name="subject">Dihydropyridine</field><field name="subject">Beta-carboline</field><field name="subject">agonist</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178954</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modernising Traditional Agriculture in China through the Development of Higher Value Agrifood Chains: the case of the beef industry</field><field name="creator">Scott Waldron</field><field name="description">China faces enormous challenges in generating sustained and inclusive agricultural and rural development. However the rapid growth occurring both inside and outside the agricultural sector provides new opportunities to meet the challenges. The development of higher value agrifood chains may provide opportunities for rural households to increase their levels of specialisation, scale and incomes, and for rural areas to broaden their employment and tax revenues bases. Facilitation of these developments effectively forms an agricultural modernisation strategy that is becoming increasingly described and prescribed by Chinese policy makers, researchers and development agencies. Despite the attention that has been given to this agricultural modernisation strategy, it has not proceeded without problems in China and has been subject to little rigorous scrutiny. This thesis uses a detailed industry case study approach to examine the way that Chinese agriculture is modernising and, as an applied study, to identify areas where China&#8217;s agricultural modernisation strategy can be refined. China&#8217;s agricultural modernisation strategy is analysed through the window of a particular Chinese agricultural and rural industry, namely the beef industry. The beef industry resembles many other agricultural and livestock industries that are commercialising, modernising and segmenting with important implications for food safety, the environment and rural incomes. In addition to providing insights into developments in the broader agricultural and livestock sectors, the Chinese beef industry is also worth examining in its own right because of its significant place in the world beef industry and in China&#8217;s livestock sector, and because it is used as a &#8220;pillar industry&#8221; in the development of many poor areas. While the thesis focuses predominantly on the beef industry, differences and similarities with other livestock industries are noted throughout the analysis. The use of an industry case study allows for a detailed analysis of a cross section of China&#8217;s markets, agribusiness and production sectors, and the integration of the sectors that form the industry. One novel aspect of the thesis is that the industry modernisation process is seen as a movement from low to high value agrifood chains in all of these sectors and for the industry as a whole. The thesis examines the drivers of and constraints to the movement from low to high value agrifood chains, the sustainability of the development of the higher value agrifood chains, and the implications for industry participants. The study draws on multiple forms of data, including extensive interview and fieldwork data over a ten year period across China, budget and scenario analyses; and macro-level data and policy documents. The cross-verification of this data allows for a rigorous, multi-disciplinary and &#8220;grounded&#8221; form of analysis that can complement other studies which draw on fewer sources of data. The thesis also provides a longitudinal and diachronic perspective of the agricultural modernisation process in contrast to a shorter term snapshot. The thesis examines the reasons and the measures by which China is attempting to move the agricultural sector beyond its primary reliance on traditional, low value agrifood chains. While the logic of these reasons and measures can be discerned, it is argued that China has attempted to &#8220;skip&#8221; development stages by over emphasising the development of large scale modern high value agrifood chains. The attempt to force the pace of modernisation has led to significant distortions and detrimental impacts. The thesis argues the need for China to refine its agricultural modernisation development strategy to be both more market conforming and to bring more benefits to industry participants in rural areas. This is best done by taking a more incremental approach to agricultural modernisation with an increased emphasis on mid value agrifood chains and the development of market facilitating policies. The analysis, findings and recommendations of the thesis may be of interest to policy makers, development agencies and researchers working on China&#8217;s agricultural and livestock sectors.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">China, agriculture, rural development, agribusiness, livestock, cattle, beef</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178993</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Proteomic analysis of glycosylation in pathogenic neisseria</field><field name="creator">Shan Chi Ku</field><field name="description">Neisseria meningitidis is the causative agent of potentially life-threatening meningitis and septicaemia. According to W.H.O., meningococcal disease causes at least 500,000 cases and results in 50,000 deaths worldwide each year (W.H.O., 2008). Neisseria gonorrhoeae is causing the second most common sexually transmitted bacterial infection, with a global incidence of 62 million cases per year. Previous studies have shown surface expressed proteins like pilin, the subunit protein that forms pili (Type IV Fimbriae), in N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae are post-translationally modified by O-glycosylation. This modification has been proposed to be of importance in the pathogenesis of these species. Although the exact function of these post-translational modifications are not fully understood, it is suggested that these modification have a role for immune evasion in the host. In this thesis, an additional outer membrane glycoprotein was identified in pathogenic Neisseria, the nitrite reductase AniA. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that AniA is glycosylated in its C-terminal imperfect (AASAP) repeat region by the pilin glycosylation pathway. This is the first report of a general O-glycosylation pathway in a prokaryote. It was shown AniA is surface exposed. To investigate whether AniA is subject to immune selection, a large collection of N. meningitidis and N. meningitidis clinical isolates were sequence analysed and evaluated. Analysis of published AniA 3D structure revealed that AniA displayed polymorphisms in residues that map to the surface of the protein. This suggests that AniA is under immune selection, and that glycosylation may facilitate immune evasion. Sequencing analyses revealed a frame shift mutation that abolished AniA expression in 34% of N. meningitidis strains surveyed. However, all N. gonorrhoeae strains examined are predicted to express AniA, implying a crucial role for AniA in gonococcal biology. In summary, the data presented here suggested that the protein may be under immune selective pressure. The addition of a phase variable glycan to this surface protein may serve as an additional immune evasion strategy. Immune selection on surface proteins in these host-adapted pathogens may have been the driving force for the evolution of this general O-glycosylation pathway. Therefore, the discovery that AniA is a glycoprotein has given insights into the pathogenesis and the host-pathogen interactions of these organisms.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">glycosylation</field><field name="subject">O-glycosylation</field><field name="subject">AniA</field><field name="subject">nitrite reductase</field><field name="subject">Neisseria meningitidis</field><field name="subject">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178994</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Iron Chelators in the Treatment of Cancer</field><field name="creator">Mohammad Islam</field><field name="description">Iron is the most abundant trace mineral in the body and an essential element in all living systems. In humans, iron is found at the active site of a number of key proteins involved in oxygen transport, metabolism, respiration and DNA synthesis. The development of agents that inhibit the iron dependent enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RR) is an established strategy in cancer therapy. Hydroxyurea is the first agent to target RR by inactivating the nonheme iron centre, but its efficacy appears to be limited to myeloproliferative disorders. Currently, Triapine&#8482; (3-aminopyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone) is a successful iron chelator, which inhibits enzyme activity and cell growth in vitro at 100 to 1000 fold lower concentrations than hydroxyurea. Preclinical studies suggested that Triapine&#8482; may be an attractive agent to move into clinical development in patients with cancer. Therefore, heterocyclic thiosemicarbazones as well as their iron complexes are an important series of compounds, which may show promising anticancer properties. Thiosemicarbazone derivatives of the HDpT (di-2-pyridyl ketone-3-thiosemicarbazone), HBpT (2-benzoylpyridine-3-thiosemicarbazone), HNBpT (2-(3&#900;-nitrobenzoyl)pyridine-3-thiosemicarbazone) and HApT (2-acetylpyridine-3-thiosemicarbazone) series and their FeII and FeIII complexes were synthesised and characterised by elemental analyses, UV-vis spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, IR (ATR, attenuated total reflectance), EPR spectroscopy, electrochemistry, and X-ray crystallography. To further understand their physical and chemical properties, other transition metal Mn, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn complexes of the HDpT and HBpT analogues were synthesised and characterised. The X-ray crystal structure of trivalent Fe complexes and divalent (Mn, Ni, Cu and Zn) complexes were determined. The HDpT, HBpT, HNBpT and HApT analogues of thiosemicarbazone class of iron chelators have the capability to bind metal ions as tridentate (N,N,S) ligands, forming 2:1 ligand:Fe complexes with an N4S2 octahedral coordination sphere. During the course of investigation, the formation constants of MnII, NiII, CuII and ZnII complexes of these series were determined by spectrophotometric competition titration with nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA). Several interesting aspects of the coordination chemistry of these iron chelators have also been discovered To better understand the biological activities of these ligands, the chemical and the physical properties of these ligands and their iron and other transition metal complexes have been studied. Chiefly, we are concerned with their ability to cross the cell membrane (lipophilicity) as well as the redox chemistry of their metal complexes. The lipophilicity of the ligands was determined by direct partitioning between 1-octanol and water at pH 7.4. The Fe complexes of the HApT series exhibit lower redox potentials than their corresponding HDpT, HBpT and HNBpT complexes and higher anticancer activity indicating a link between their Fe redox reactivity and their biological properties.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="subject">Thiosemicarbazones</field><field name="subject">Chelators</field><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179025</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Justice or Judgement? The Criminal Justice System and Women&#8217;s, Police Officers&#8217;, Support Workers&#8217;, and Potential Jurors&#8217; Perspectives on Rape</field><field name="creator">King, Rachel</field><field name="description">This thesis provides strong, triangulated evidence to suggest that despite many reforms to legislation, policy and training, in an Australian context, there has been limited improvement in the manner by which police officers respond to complaints of rape and treat women who have experienced rape. My research provides insight into a police organisation that is rarely open to scrutiny, and shows that when a woman reports a rape to police, she is less likely to be believed if, for example, she has been raped by someone familiar to her, or if she has demonstrated non-consent in an acquiescent manner. It is within this climate that I conducted my research to gain the perceptions of women who have experienced rape regarding the criminal justice response to rape, the perceptions of support workers from Centres Against Sexual Assault (CASAs) on the criminal justice response to rape, police officers&#8217; perceptions of the manner in which rape is dealt with by police, and the perceptions of potential jurors regarding rape. This research therefore examines the factors which influenced which rape cases were investigated by police and referred to prosecution by police, and the manner in which police decisions were made, based on non legal factors such as stereotypes, myths, individual and collective factors. This thesis comprises four separate but complementary studies and combines quantitative and qualitative research techniques. Study 1 investigated the perceptions of women (N=6) who have experienced rape regarding the police response to rape in semi-structured in depth interviews. Analysis of this data suggested police officers&#8217; treatment and decisions regarding these women&#8217;s experiences were determined by the relationship between the woman and the perpetrator, and by rape myths regarding &#8216;real rapes&#8217; and &#8216;genuine victims&#8217;. Through focus groups (N=4) with support workers from Centres Against Sexual Assault (CASAs) Study 2 examined the perceptions of these workers regarding the manner by which rape myths and gender stereotypes influenced police officers&#8217; treatment and decisions regarding complaints of rape made by women. In support of the women&#8217;s perceptions from Study 1, this data indicated CASA workers believed that police officers&#8217; responses are heavily imbued with stereotypes and myths regarding appropriate behaviours for women, and those associated with mental illness and ethnicity. The data obtained in Study 3 elucidated a more detailed understanding of the influence of rape myths and gender stereotypes on the police response to rape. In semi-structured in depth interviews (N=14) police officers identified factors such as alcohol use, mental illness, the effect of potential jurors&#8217; perceptions regarding a woman, and the relationship between the woman and the perpetrator as influencing their decision making. Police officers also described the manner by which they use these stereotypes to arrive at a &#8216;hunch&#8217;, using intuition to determine the credibility of a woman who reports rape. Through surveys, Study 4 investigated the influence of rape myths and gender stereotypes on potential jurors (N=161) perceptions of what constitutes rape, and provided some insight regarding the attitudes police officers may consider when determining the &#8216;convictability&#8217; of a rape complaint. The data from Study 4 indicated that potential jurors are less likely to define a scenario as rape when the familiarity between the woman and the perpetrator increased, when the woman had been drinking alcohol and when the woman demonstrated her non-consent in an acquiescent manner. Of critical importance, interviews with police officers indicated they use considerable discretion to act on their hunches and intuition to arrive at decisions regarding the woman&#8217;s credibility based on rape myths and gender stereotypes. The triangulation of findings from women&#8217;s, CASA support workers&#8217;, and from police officers, suggest women who report rape to police are going to be judged by interpretations of the legal definitions of what constitutes rape that are imbued with rape myths and gender stereotypes. My findings illustrate the importance of seeking methods that will improve the substantial under reporting of rape. My findings also demonstrate that if women do have their cases proceed to court, they are likely to be subjected to considerable disbelief as a consequence of prejudicial attitudes within jurors, which are similar to those of police. In response to these findings, suggestions for improvements are recommended, such as specialist rape courts and evaluations of the content of police training. Ultimately, this research illustrates that in 2009 in Australia, women who report rape are subject to considerable uncertainty regarding whether they will receive justice or judgement.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">370000 Studies in Human Society</field><field name="subject">rape</field><field name="subject">Police</field><field name="subject">criminal justice system</field><field name="subject">victims/survivors</field><field name="subject">Centres Against Sexual Assault</field><field name="subject">legislation</field><field name="subject">potential jurors</field><field name="subject">empowerment methodology</field><field name="subject">interviews</field><field name="subject">surveys</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179034</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biology of Botrytis cinerea infecting waxflower (Chamelaucium) flowers and potential elicitation of host defence in this pathosystem</field><field name="creator">Son-Quang Dinh</field><field name="description">Waxflower (Chamelaucium spp. and hybrids) is the singlemost important Australian export cut-flower. The major problem in waxflower trading is flower abscission after harvest. While several factors are involved, ethylene production resulting from preharvest infection with the fungus Botrytis cinerea is the most important cause. The general objectives of this study were to investigate the biology of Botrytis infecting waxflower flowers and potential elicitation of host defence against this pathogen. Effects of anti-ethylene and S-carvone treatments on Botrytis-induced flower abscission were also evaluated. Infection of flowers by Botrytis was studied on two waxflower cvs. Mullering Brook and My Sweet Sixteen using light and electron microscopy. Conidial germination and protoappressorial formation occurred within 8 h post-inoculation (hpi). Infection of most floral organs, including petals, anthers and filaments, stigma, and hypanthium, was within 24 hpi. Infection cushions on stamen bases were formed at 36 hpi by saprophytic hyphae that originated from anthers. This infection route probably gives rise to the typical tan-coloured Botrytis symptoms that appear to radiate from this part of the flower. Subcuticular hyphae were present at very high density near stamen bases. They evidently resulted at multiple penetrations from single infection cushions. Flower abscission occurred at 72 hpi. At this time, floral tube tissues remained uninfected. This temporal pattern infers the possible transmission of a signal (e.g. ethylene) upon Botrytis infection (6&#8211;36 hpi) that intiates a defence response of shedding infected flowers (72 hpi). Susceptibility of waxflower before and after harvest to B. cinerea under various environmental conditions (laboratory, greenhouse, and field) was investigated. Flowers, either on plants or on cut stems showed similar susceptibility to B. cinerea and abscised under cool temperatures (~20 &#186;C) and high humidity (&gt;95% RH) conditions following infection. Compared to cv. Mullering Brook, cv. My Sweet Sixteen was somewhat more resistant to B. cinerea infection under field conditions. Constitutive and inducible antifungal compounds in waxflower flower tissues were screened in cvs. CWA Pink, Stephan&#8217;s Delight, Mullering Brook and My Sweet Sixteen using thin layer chromatography bioassays with isolates of B. cinerea and Alternaria alternata (pathogenic) and Cladosporium cladosporioides (non-pathogenic). Common inhibition zone observed at Rf 0.28&#8211;0.38, 0.46&#8211;0.56 and 0.67&#8211;0.76 contained phenolic compounds. There were at least five (cv. Mullering Brook) and one (cv. My Sweet Sixteen) inducible antifungal phenolic compounds as judged by increases in inhibition area as a result of B. cinerea infection and methyl jasmonate treatment. The total areas of B. cinerea- and MeJA-induced inhibition zones were approximately 2.0- and 2.5-folds greater, respectively, than zones from control flowers. Preharvest sprays of three different known host plant defence elicitors, methyl jasmonate (MeJA), benzothiadiazole (BTH), and silicon (Si), were applied to waxflower cvs. Mullering Brook and My Sweet Sixteen plants. BTH or Si sprays generally had no significant effect on postharvest Botrytis severity on either cultivar. MeJA sprays did not reduce B. cinerea on cv. Mullering Brook. MeJA slightly suppressed B. cinerea on cv. My Sweet Sixteen at 500 and 750 &#181;M. Overall, field applications of these host plant defence elicitor chemicals as spray treatments had little effect on vase life, water uptake and relative fresh weight of the cut sprigs. Moreover, they did not appreciably suppress B. cinerea or associated postharvest floral abscission. The efficacy of combined elicitor treatments and combined pre- and postharvest MeJA treatments were assessed. Preharvest foliar applications of MeJA (1000 &#181;M; 2 or 4 times), MeJA (1000 &#181;M) combined with BTH (150 mg/L), and MeJA combined with Si (1500 mg SiO2/L) generally did not suppress postharvest B. cinerea development and flower abscission from harvested sprigs. A pre- plus post-harvest 1000 &#181;M MeJA spray treatment consistently but only slightly suppressed B. cinerea infection on flowers from both pot- and field-grown plants. Pre- and post-harvest MeJA treatments reduced B. cinerea development, but increased flower abscission. Combined MeJA and anti-ethylene treatments were then screened for potential to suppress B. cinerea while preventing flower abscission. However, the combined MeJA and 1-MCP treatment reduced neither Botrytis disease nor flower abscission on sprigs from pot- and field-grown plants. The combined MeJA and STS treatment reduced disease severity for up to 6 days on sprigs harvested from pot-grown plants but tended to increase Botrytis severity on sprigs from field-grown plants 6 days after inoculation. Antifungal effects of the essential oil S-carvone against B. cinerea germination and mycelial growth were demonstrated in vitro. Inhibition increased with increasing S-carvone concentrations from 0.64 mM to 5.08 mM. However, in planta, S-carvone concentrations in this range did not affect either Botrytis disease levels or flower abscission on cut waxflower flowers.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">anti-ethylene</field><field name="subject">Antifungal</field><field name="subject">Benzothiadiazole</field><field name="subject">Botrytis cinerea</field><field name="subject">Chamelaucium</field><field name="subject">Electron Microscopy</field><field name="subject">grey mould</field><field name="subject">Methyl Jasmonate</field><field name="subject">Resistance</field><field name="subject">S-carvone</field><field name="subject">Waxflower</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179049</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Continuities of Child and Adult Mental Health: Changes in maternal mental health over the course of child rearing and adolescent mental health and behaviour</field><field name="creator">Belinda Lloyd</field><field name="description">Background There is a body of literature suggesting that postnatal depression &#8211; and poor maternal mental health generally &#8211; may lead to impaired child mental health, child behaviour and poorer cognitive outcomes. Some studies have also provided data showing significant associations between maternal mental illness and impaired child outcomes. While the available data is suggestive, it is largely derived from cross-sectional studies which do not have a capacity to assess the temporal sequences involved. Little is known about the impact of the severity, timing or chronicity of maternal mental health problems over the child&#8217;s life course on child mental health and behaviour. After examining patterns of maternal mental health impairment over the period of child rearing, the impact of maternal mental health impairment on adolescent behaviour problems at fourteen years of age is assessed. Specifically, the role of maternal anxiety, depression and co-occurring anxiety and depression were considered. This study used data from a prospective birth cohort study, with repeated measures of maternal mental health, to determine whether impaired maternal mental health in pregnancy, early childhood or early adolescence impact on the adolescent child&#8217;s mental health and behaviour. Material and Methods The Mater University Study of Pregnancy (MUSP) provided the data base for this study. Women were recruited from a large metropolitan hospital in Brisbane, Australia at their first antenatal visit &#8211; generally around the middle of the second trimester of pregnancy (on average at eighteen weeks gestation). Additional data was obtained 3-5 days after the birth of the child, six months after the birth of the child, when the child reached five years of age, and again when the study child reached fourteen years of age. During these phases of data collection, detailed information was obtained on the mother&#8217;s demographic characteristics, health information and also relating to a range of social factors. Data relating to the child was also derived using maternal reports throughout the study, and also child self-report at the fourteen-year follow up. Maternal anxiety and depression was measured at each phase of the study using the Delusions-Symptoms-States Inventory (DSSI) developed by Bedford &amp; Foulds (1978). Child self-reported mental health and behaviour was assessed using the Child Behaviour Check List.(CBCL) (Achenbach &amp; Edelbrock 1990). Maternal age and family income were included in analyses as potentially confounding factors, and maternal marital change and marital satisfaction were included as potential mediators. The full birth cohort of the MUSP study constituted 7223 mothers and their babies. The subset used in the current study includes 4297 mother and child pairs. This constitutes approximately sixty percent of the original birth cohort. Findings Maternal mental health impairment was analysed in terms of severity of impairment, timing of mental health impairment (during sensitive periods of child development &#8211; the antenatal/postnatal period and during later childhood/adolescence), and recurrence of episodes of mental health impairment. Rates of maternal mental health impairment were found to increase in occurrence and severity over the course of child rearing, with recurrence of episodes being a common manifestation of all forms of impairment. It is significant to note the mental health of women in the sample appears to decline as their children grow and develop into adolescents. The increase in maternal mental health impairment experienced as children progress through childhood into adolescence might be indicative of the pressures associated with raising children. This is a notion not previously explored in the literature. Contrary to existing literature, the analyses conducted in this study found that maternal mental health impairment occurring during the antenatal/postnatal period of child development had no independent negative impact on adolescent behavioural outcomes. The longitudinal nature of the data allowed for an assessment of these sensitive periods, whilst controlling for later occurring mental health impairment &#8211; a potential confounder not accounted for in many previous studies. Proximal and recurrent exposure to maternal mental health impairment was associated with a significantly increased risk of adolescent mental health and behavioural problems in children at fourteen years of age. Conclusion There is a need to further explore the nature and course of maternal mental health impairment during child rearing. The findings presented here point to the need for support for mothers to improve their mental health during later stages of child rearing &#8211; particularly in the period during which their children are adolescents. This period is significant both in terms of increased rates of maternal mental health impairment, and also the negative influences of exposure to maternal mental health impairment in terms of impaired adolescent mental health and behavioural outcomes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mental health</field><field name="subject">Maternal</field><field name="subject">Child</field><field name="subject">behaviour</field><field name="subject">anxiety</field><field name="subject">depression</field><field name="subject">Adolescent</field><field name="subject">Longitudinal</field><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179069</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PARTICIPATORY PROGRAMS AND FOOD SECURITY IN RURAL SRI LANKA</field><field name="creator">Hasanthi Buddhika Wirasagoda</field><field name="description">Abstract This research is concerned with exploring, describing and interpreting the potential of community participation in improving food security in rural households in the Kolonna area. It explores the importance and value of the ancient village tank system as a vehicle for enhancing both community participation and food security. In Sri Lanka there still exists a network of large and small irrigation tanks and associated distribution and drainage channels that was originally established 1000-2000 years ago. This system apparently formed the basis of an effective cooperative social system that endured for centuries. More recently, several centuries of colonial rule caused the abolition of this participatory system by the British and the social structure and tank system of the village collapsed. Since independence in 1948, several government departments and international institutions have been trying to rebuild this social structure around the village tank, but with only limited success. This thesis describes efforts to document the potential for incorporating historical knowledge and farmers&#8217; perceptions into sustainable community participatory programs in agricultural activities based on village tanks, with the aim of improving food security in a rural area of Sri Lanka. A mixed methods approach was employed to address the research questions identified for the study. It involved predominantly qualitative methodology including focus groups and individual interviews with a range of stakeholders including government and spiritual authorities allowed the exploration of the realities of village life and issues affecting food security. Significant findings not evident in typical governmental statistical reports include the following: (1) Household food security in rural areas is still a major problem. Agricultural production rather than purchased food is the main source for caloric intake of rural households and many farmers experience food insecurity due to unexpected seasonal crop failures. Furthermore, almost 10% of the residents of Kolonna area experience acute food insecurity, which occurs due to poverty. These people typically do not have secure access to land for growing their own crops but rely on casual wages work. (2) The major constraint to food security identified by respondents was lack of consistently available and equitably distributed irrigation water, although in contrast occasional flood damages to land and crops s due to flood was also a significant problem. Some farmers also believed that marketing and distribution channel constraints limited their commercial returns and income, and capacity to enjoy year-round food security. v (3) Despite the existence of several community participatory programs in the Kolonna area, they are not perceived to be successful. Only one third of the villagers are involved in these programs and more than 40% were unaware of their existence. Major criticisms included the perception of political interference and favoritism in the process governing their operations, which favored relatively few recipients. . (4) There appears to be strong support amongst villagers for revision of cooperative approaches such that management is by representatively elected independent committee that allow involvement of the most suitable farmers. This perception was linked to beliefs that a renewed focus on the village tank would be ultimately more beneficial than focusing solely on improving food security, because of the capacity to incorporate traditional community participatory approaches. Valuable features of the traditional system include sharing rather than hiring labor, dividing communal tasks among community members, and rules and regulations imposed by a recognized and accepted governing body. The implications of these findings for further research, policy and practice are discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Community, participatory, tank, food security, rural Sri Lanka</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179074</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Foetal programming for improved immune resistance against gastrointestinal parasites in rats and sheep</field><field name="creator">Francoise Mcpherson</field><field name="description">Abstract Experiments in this thesis were conducted to investigate the possibility of bestowing lambs with increased resistance to gastrointestinal parasites through maternal protein and copper supplementation. Reproductive outcomes such as birth weight, haematological parameters and faecal egg counts were used as indices of possible foetal programming. This thesis involved 5 experiments. The first three experiments were done using rats as a preliminary study animal on account of their short generational intervals and high fecundity. The final two experiments involved Merino sheep. The first experiment in Chapter 4 investigated the most optimum larval dose to use in order to elicit a measurable immune response. Weaned offspring were infected with a rat nematode, Nippostrongylus brasiliensis and their response measured by faecal egg counts, parasite recovery from intestines at sacrifice, spleen weights and leucocyte numbers, especially manifested as eosinophilia. There was no significant difference in parasite rejection for rats infected with 1000 larvae/rat. When rats were infected with variable larval doses to determine the optimum dose rate, eosinophilia and spleen weight were significantly increased as dose rate increased from 500 L3 to 2,000 larvae. Based on these results, it was decided to use 1,000 larvae for each rat in Chapter 6. The experiment in Chapter 5 involved feeding diets with 5 graded concentrations of copper (Cu) ranging from deficient (1 ppm diet) to high (16 ppm diet). Rats were fed for 4 weeks before mating after which half of them were sacrificed to determine liver Cu concentrations and haematological parameters. The rest were mated and maintained on their respective Cu diets into the second trimester of pregnancy. Pregnant females were sacrificed on approximately gestational Day 10 to recover foetuses and determine the incidence of foetal defects, foetal Cu status as well as maternal liver copper status. It was determined that most morphological defects occurred for the 1 ppm foetuses and both 2 ppm and 4 ppm had similar incidences of brain enlargements. The 16 ppm copper diet was excessive evidenced by reduced liver iron status and erythrocyte counts to similar levels as for 2 ppm rats although it had no adverse effect on foetal development. Significant differences were found for liver Cu status, erythrocyte counts and spleen weights due to the copper diets. A deficient copper diet containing 1 ppm Cu (LC) and an adequate diet containing 8 ppm Cu (SC) were used for the last rat experiment in Chapter 6 which was funded by the Science and Innovation Award. The LC diets were fed for 4 weeks prior to mating. Rats were then fed LC throughout pregnancy, for the 1st trimester only or for the 1st and 2nd trimesters. Other pregnant females were fed the SC diet throughout pregnancy. Offspring were challenged with 1000 L3 N. brasiliensis and their immune responses measured. Copper deficiency at variable stages of prenatal development caused significant postnatal mortalities but had no effect on response to parasite resistance. However, significant parasite and sex effects were found for parameters such as spleen weight, eosinophilia and weight loss during infection. The foetal brain enlargement caused by the deficient 1 ppm Cu diet was determined to be reversible in vivo upon exposure to a normal 8 ppm Cu diet during gestation. Chapter 7 involved Merino ewes which were fed either a high protein diet (21%) or adequate protein diet (12%) during the first 2 trimesters of pregnancy. Production parameters measured included pregnancy weight gain, fleece yield, protein content in milk as well as birth weight of lambs but none were significantly different. After weaning, the lambs were experimentally infected with 10,000 Haemonchus contortus larvae. Barber&#8217;s pole worm is responsible for millions of dollars in production losses in the sheep industry. Responses measured were eosinophilia, faecal egg count, anaemia (PCV) and weight gain/loss during the infection period. No significant differences were found for any parameter tested except for a parasite effect on erythrocyte numbers and PCV. In Chapter 8 Merino ewes were used which were mildly Cu deficient due to grazing on pasture that was copper deficient. Control ewes were supplemented with copper oxide wire particles at mating and mid-pregnancy. The rest of the experiment was the same as for Chapter 7 in terms of Barber&#8217;s pole worm larval dose. There were no significant differences in birth weight, weaning weight or ewe fleece weights due to copper status. There were no differences in parasite resistance in the lambs due to maternal Cu status measured by live weights, eosinophil concentrations or faecal egg counts. In conclusion, foetal programming by maternal nutritional supplements for postnatal parasite resistance appears to be impossible. It may be that if a different organ was targeted, such as the spleen, the results would have been different. The thymus appears to be non-programmable during foetal development in rats and sheep. However, it was a worthwhile attempt at conferring resistance to parasites in lambs due to the urgency in combating the global problem of parasite resistance to anthelmintics and the resultant large economic losses that are experienced by the global sheep industry.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Foetal programming</field><field name="subject">protein</field><field name="subject">copper</field><field name="subject">larvae</field><field name="subject">gastrointestinal parasite</field><field name="subject">sheep</field><field name="subject">rats</field><field name="subject">haematology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179082</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mental Health Policy Reform: Developing a conceptual overview of content and process</field><field name="creator">Clare Townsend</field><field name="description">Abstract The global burden of neuropsychiatric disorders is rising worldwide. This burden will be felt most in developing countries which have limited resources to respond. Within the health sector, mental health has traditionally been a low priority in most countries, resources to address the burden are limited and mental illness competes with other serious disease for government attention. Despite high-profile international statements, mental health reform has been slow and mental health has remained a low-level political priority, particularly in developing countries and Newly Independent States. There is growing recognition of the need for mental health development and reform. There is growing consensus that successful delivery of mental health interventions to address the disease burden is constrained not only by resource limitations but also by the absence of policy and planning frameworks to identify and deliver these interventions. This thesis highlights that the preparation and adoption of a policy position and the development of a comprehensive policy document is the outcome of a range of complex interactions between environmental factors and the stakeholders within the policy environment. There is growing recognition within the policy sciences literature that a comprehensive understanding of the overall policy process requires an individual and combined understanding of the content of a policy and the processes involved in achieving policy status and implementing policy. Little is documented regarding the content domains and elements which should be included in a mental health policy and the key variables within the policy environment which impact on the mental health policy development process. As a result there are no universally applicable blue prints or policy formulation tools for mental health policy which recognise the complexity of mental health systems and identify key issues which need to be considered in understanding how to promote mental health onto the policy agenda, how to develop a policy once this has been achieved and how stakeholders can more effectively engage in mental health policy agenda building. This thesis addresses this issue by undertaking three distinct but interlinked tasks. Part 1 contributes new knowledge to the area of mental health policy content. It identifies the key content domains and elements which constitute a comprehensive mental health policy. The domains and elements are validated through an extensive consultative process, undertaken by the author, with key mental health stakeholders in 40 countries in all six WHO regions of the world in 2000 and 2001. Based on this work the thesis develops an innovative conceptual tool for mental health policy makers, The Mental Health Policy Template. Whilst responding most particularly to the needs of developing countries and Independent States, the Template is sufficiently generic to be used in a range of countries, provinces and at district levels. The experience of many mental health reformers in developing countries and Newly Independent States is that raising mental health onto the policy agenda and maintaining it there is an on-going challenge. Conceptual models for understanding mental health policy process are extremely limited. Part 2 of this thesis responds to this situation by drawing on the policy analysis literature, with particular focus on agenda building. It identifies two key variables, Context and Stakeholders and their components. These variables are argued to impact on raising mental health onto the policy agenda. The applicability of these variables and their components is demonstrated through the analysis of two country experiences of mental health policy development and reform. One country, Lithuania is a Newly Independent State and the other, Zambia is a developing country. The information collected for these country studies was developed by a series of country visits and stakeholder consultations by the author between 2000 and 2007. The analysis of the country data suggests that the experiences of two quite disparate countries can be usefully organised using the variables and components identified from the literature and may be applicable across a diverse range of countries. This constitutes new knowledge of the variables which impact on mental health policy process and mental health policy reform. Part 3 of this thesis proposes a conceptual model which synthesises the new knowledge established in Part1 and 2. A Mental Health Policy Development Model is proposed which brings together the policy literature and country experiences. It identifies the key content and process factors which need to be considered in mental health policy development and reform with particular application to developing countries and Newly Independent States. The model can be used by those wishing to more fully understand and undertake mental health policy development and reform. To my knowledge such work has not been undertaken in the area of mental health and constitutes a basis for further development in the field. Finally, the thesis acknowledges the formative nature of the work and makes suggestions for further research to build this knowledge ideally in partnership with other key mental health policy stakeholders throughout the world.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mental health, policy, content, process</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179090</field></doc><doc><field name="title">STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF PILIN POST-TRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATIONS IN NEISSERIA MENINGITIDIS</field><field name="creator">Freda En-chi Jen</field><field name="description">Neisseria meningitidis is a causative agent of meningitis and septicaemia. Pili are one of the major virulence factors that contribute to the pathogenicity of N. meningitidis. Pili of Neisseria are type IV fimbriae composed primarily of thousands of identical pilin subunits. Pilin of N. meningitidis is post-translationally modified by trisaccharide, phosphorylcholine and &#61537;-glycerophosphate. The genes involved in pilin expression, pilin glycosylation and phosphorylcholine modification are phase variable (high frequency ON/OFF switching of expression). The function of pilin post-translational modifications and their phase variable expression in host:pathogen interactions is unknown. The phase variable expression of glycosylation in bacteria has been proposed to function in bacterial adherence and immune avoidance. However, the function of pilin glycosylation in N. meningitidis is unclear. Phosphorylcholine is expressed in a number of respiratory organisms including P. aeruginosa (on teichoic acid), S. pneumoniae (on lipoteichoic acid) and H. influenzae (on LPS). Phosphorylcholine in these organisms is important in colonisation of the nasopharynx and invasion of the epithelium. Studies on N. meningitidis pilin post-translational modifications have been restricted by difficulties in purification of pilin protein. In this thesis, we evaluated current pilin purification methods and established an efficient method of purifying pilin from N. meningitidis by Flag-tag purification system. Flag-tag purified pilin is post-translationally modified. The LC-ESI/MS/MS analysis performed in this thesis using Flag-tag purified pilin successfully determined the phosphorylcholine post-translational modification sites. Based on the MS data and the mutagenesis analysis, phosphorylcholine is covalently linked to serine 157 and serine 160 of pilin. The colony immunoblot of a serine 157/160 to alanine mutant revealed that phosphorylcholine modifications of these sites on pilin are the only surface exposed phosphorylcholine and is responsible for binding to TEPC-15 (the monoclonal antibody which binds to phosphorylcholine). In this thesis, molecular modelling demonstrated that surface exposure of pilin phosphorylcholine could be altered by the phase variation of pilin glycosylation on the adjacent pilin monomer. Furthermore, the sites for phosphorylcholine modification are commonly observed in N. meningitidis strains but not in N. gonorrhoeae indicating the importance of phosphorylcholine in pathogenisis of N. meningitidis. In addition, the biosynthesis of phosphorylcholine for pilin post-translational modification still remains a mystery. Bacteria generally obtain choline from the environment. In this thesis, we demonstrated that pilin phosphorylcholine post-translational modification could be endogenously synthesized in N. meningitidis. In summary, this thesis describes the purification method of obtaining pure post-translationally modified pilin from N. meningitidis. The phosphorylcholine post-translation modification sites on pilin have been determined and showed the importance of these sites in antibody binding specificity.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neisseria meningitidis</field><field name="subject">Glycosylation</field><field name="subject">Phosphorylcholine</field><field name="subject">Type IV fimbriae</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179147</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Function, Expression and Glucose-dependent Regulation of Monocarboxylate-Proton Co-transporter molecules (MCT) in Mouse Preimplantation Development.</field><field name="creator">Sarah Jansen</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT The purpose of this project was to investigate monocarboxylate (i.e. pyruvate and lactate) transport in the preimplantation stage of embryo development. Much progress has been made over the last 15 years towards understanding preimplantation and peri-implantation embryo physiology, including metabolic preferences during this period. It is known that as the cells (blastomeres) of an embryo compact via tight junctions and the embryo differentiates into a blastocyst, a metabolic &#8220;switch&#8221; occurs to allow the blastocyst to take up glucose at a rapid rate, obtaining energy derived from glycolysis. Glucose transporter molecules have been identified and characterized during this period of development and a paradigm for glucose transport has been described. However, during the early cleavage stages (days 1-3 post-fertilization), the embryo preferentially derives its metabolic energy from the monocarboxylate pyruvate. Evidence for the expression of pyruvate transporter molecules (a family of proton-coupled monocarboxylate co-transporters, MCT) has only been indicated via some kinetic studies on pH homeostasis and PCR analysis for MCT expression, and results have been conflicting (Gibb et al., 1997, Harding et al., 1999, Herubel et al., 2002). This project aimed to clarify discrepancies in reports for mRNA expression of MCT and to enhance the understanding of monocarboxylate transport processes during preimplantation development by pioneering investigations into protein expression for various MCT isoforms. Transport kinetics for monocarboxylate, DL-lactate, were examined by measuring the uptake of radioactive [3H]-DL-lactate from the medium by two-cell embryos and blastocysts. It was discovered that blastocysts demonstrate significantly higher affinity for DL-lactate compared to zygotes (Km 20 + 10 v 87 + 35 mM lactate; p=0.03), which suggested that alterations in the expression of various MCT isoforms might be expected as the embryo developed to a blastocyst. The rate of transport showed a trend towards a decrease from the zygote to blastocyst stages, although this could not be confirmed as significant within the limitations of this experiment. Mouse embryos, both in vivo and in vitro-derived, were collected and pooled at the zygote, two-cell, morula and blastocyst stages of development. RNA purification, reverse-transcription and PCR were used to analyze the expression of the four best-characterized MCT isoforms. MCT1, MCT2 and MCT4 were all found to be expressed in oocytes and mouse embryos from the zygote through to the preimplantation blastocyst. MCT3, an isoform uniquely expressed in the retina, was not detected at any stage in embryos. Since glucose has been implicated in regulatory processes involving glucose transporter expression in mouse embryos (Pantaleon et al., 2005, Pantaleon et al., 2001), mRNA expression was examined in the presence or absence of glucose in the culture media to determine whether the same phenomena applied to MCT. It was discovered that MCT1 and MCT4 isoforms were responsive to glucose-deprivation as evidenced by a reduction in mRNA expression in compacted morula cultured from the zygote stage without glucose. When glucose-deprived embryos were exposed to a brief high concentration of glucose during the 4-cell stage of development and continued in culture without glucose, the expression of mRNA for MCT1 and MCT4 persisted post-compaction, demonstrating that glucose exposure is necessary for the continued expression of these two isoforms in the mouse blastocyst. MCT2 mRNA did not respond to the absence of glucose in this way, and mRNA expression persisted in either the presence or absence of glucose. To follow these analyses of MCT gene transcription during early embryo development, confocal laser scanning immunofluorescence and western blotting were used to identify the expression of MCT proteins at various stages of development. Culture in the presence or absence of glucose was again employed to determine whether the changes seen in mRNA expression were conveyed at the protein level. All three proteins were identified throughout preimplantation development, though their locations were uniquely different. MCT1 was notably absent from plasma membranes at all stages, and was detected diffusely within the cytoplasm. In expanding blastocysts MCT1 tended to concentrate in the cortical cytoplasm of blastomeres and staining was more intense in the polar trophectoderm. In this cytoplasmic location its function is unclear. MCT1 does not appear to be a key transporter of monocarboxylates into and out of the embryo, but it may have a role in shuttling pyruvate and lactate within the cytoplasm to maintain metabolic and redox homeostasis. In embryos cultured without glucose, the immunostaining intensity for MCT1 gradually decreased as morulae degenerated and died. Protein loss occurred from the morula stage onwards, whilst mRNA was already undetectable at this stage. This would indicate that glucose signals which maintain mRNA expression most likely operate at the level of gene activation/transcription with latent effects on protein expression. MCT4 appeared to be located on the plasma membranes of oocytes and 2-cell embryos and nuclear staining was evident throughout preimplantation development, however plasma membrane expression was not apparent in morulae and blastocysts. This is consistent with earlier kinetic evidence of a low affinity lactate transporter (Km 87 + 35 mM lactate) operating at the early preimplantation stages. MCT4 has the lowest affinity for lactate of all the characterized MCT to date. Kinetic data also suggests that a change might occur in MCT protein expression as the embryo progresses to a blastocyst with a higher affinity lactate transporter taking precedence, and the loss of MCT4 from the plasma membrane at these later stages supports this view. Similarly to MCT1, MCT4 mRNA expression was also found to be dependent on glucose exposure during the early preimplantation period, and embryos cultured entirely without glucose demonstrated a loss of MCT4 mRNA expression at the morula stage. MCT4 typically exists as a lactate exporter in glycolytic tissues and it most likely exports lactate from the embryo for pH and redox homeostasis during this period of development. Protein localization studies found MCT2 to be located on the plasma membranes of oocytes, zygotes, 2-cell embryos, and polarized to the surface of the outer blastomeres of morulae and blastocyst trophectodermal cells. Throughout preimplantation development, MCT2 protein co-localized with peroxisomal catalase in peroxisome-sized granules throughout the cells. Known to be a high affinity pyruvate transporter, given its location in embryos it was proposed here that MCT2 most likely imports pyruvate to fuel early embryos, and later works as a bifunctional pyruvate/lactate importer/exporter on the transporting epithelium (trophectoderm) of blastocysts to maintain the pH, redox and metabolic status of the embryo. MCT2 was an enigma to the other MCT. Its expression in the absence of glucose behaved in an opposite way to that of MCT1 and MCT4, with mRNA expression persisting in the absence of glucose. In fact, MCT2 and catalase proteins demonstrated a quantitative increase in embryos lacking glucose, and the increase in staining was noticed as an increase in the density of peroxisome-like structures (or peroxisome proliferation) within the embryo. As such, it was decided to investigate the possibility that peroxisome proliferators (Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptors, PPARs) were involved in the control of MCT expression in the same way that they are known to control the expression of catalase and other peroxisomal proteins. At this stage, no MCT isoforms had been identified as being under the control of PPARs, although it was known that their expression was most likely controlled at the level of transcription, with no translational or post-translational controlling elements. PPAR&#945;, one of three isoforms (&#945;, &#947; and &#946;/&#948;) was selected as a likely candidate given that it controls peroxisomal proliferation and fatty acid &#946;-oxidation processes at the level of transcription in other tissues, and it was known to be upregulated in conditions of starvation and oxidative stress. PPAR&#945; mRNA was shown to be expressed in early cleavage preimplantation mouse embryos, but its expression was reduced in morulae and blastocysts. Further, lack of glucose led to persistence of PPAR&#945; mRNA expression at the morula stage. PPAR&#945; protein was also demonstrated to stain more brightly in early preimplantation embryos compared to later stages. Further experimentation demonstrated that the phenomenon of increased catalase and MCT2 expression in embryos cultured without glucose could be mimicked in the presence of glucose by treating these embryos with the PPAR&#945;-selective agonist, WY14,643. The timing and quantitative nature of this upregulation were very similar, suggesting that PPAR&#945; was in some way involved in the glucose-deprived upregulation pathway for catalase and MCT2. To further investigate this pathway, oxidative stress was investigated in embryos cultured in the presence and absence of glucose to test whether the generation of reactive oxygen species contributed to the PPAR&#945;/MCT2 phenomenon. It was demonstrated that within 2 h of culture in the absence of glucose, hydrogen peroxide levels were significantly elevated in zygotes. Amelioration of increased peroxide generation in glucose-deprived embryos using a non-selective flavoenzyme inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) eliminated any increases in PPAR&#945; and MCT2 protein expression that were earlier noted in the absence of glucose. To summarize, MCT1, MCT2 and MCT4 mRNA and protein expression were successfully demonstrated in mouse preimplantation embryos and all were confirmed to be in some way regulated by glucose in the culture medium. In the absence of glucose, mRNA expression for MCT1 and MCT4 were reduced to undetectable levels in morulae indicating that their expression was glucose-dependent. Paradoxically, glucose deprivation caused an increase in PPAR&#945;, catalase and MCT2 protein expression. PPAR&#945;-selective agonism in the presence of glucose induced similar timing and effects on catalase and MCT2 upregulation, implicating PPAR&#945; in this pathway. Hydrogen peroxide levels were significantly elevated within 2 h of culture in the absence of glucose. This peroxide elevation could be quenched to control levels by treating these embryos with DPI, and reducing hydrogen peroxide to control levels also eliminated the upregulation of PPAR&#945; and MCT2, implicating oxidative stress as an important component in the glucose-deprivation induced upregulation of MCT2. The experimental data presented in this thesis demonstrate that from its very conception, the embryo interacts with, adapts to, and is indeed affected by the external environment in which it develops. Even components like glucose, once considered simply as metabolic substrates, have profound effects on gene transcription and protein expression within the embryo which may impact on later its developmental competence, a reality we need to consider more deeply in light of the implementation of artificial reproductive technologies widely used today in zoology, agriculture and clinically, in humans.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mice</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="subject">mammal</field><field name="subject">blastocyst</field><field name="subject">zygote</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">monocarboxylate</field><field name="subject">metabolism</field><field name="subject">embryo development</field><field name="subject">preimplantation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179148</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Translation and Language Ideology in Singapore</field><field name="creator">Tong King Lee</field><field name="description">This dissertation examines the problems of translation within the language ideological context of multilingual Singapore. On the basis of textual and paratextual data from published literary translations and with reference to the language power relation between the English language and the Chinese language in contemporary Singapore, the study raises questions about the relationship between literary translation and language ideology in Singapore. These questions are concerned with textual problems in translating heterolingual texts, interpretive problems facing the target readers of translated Chinese-language texts that deal with the Chinese identity crisis and the ideological functions that translation plays in the making of multilingual literary anthologies. In delineating the general character of cross-cultural communication in Singapore, the study combines various theoretical perspectives and employs both textual and contextual approaches of inquiry. The dissertation consists of three main parts. The first part discusses the textual problems involved in the translation of heterolingual Chinese literature thematically concerned with the ideological tension between English and Chinese in Singapore. Drawing on the theory of the metonymics of translation as well as code-switching theories, the identity function of heterolingualism in Chinese literary texts is first established as creating a metonymic link between the linguistic tension in the literary texts and the ideological tension between English and Chinese in Singapore society. It is then proposed that when a heterolingual text using Chinese as its matrix language code-switches into English as part of its textual strategy, the translation of this text into the English language necessarily creates a crisis of representation in which the English language paradoxically projects itself as the cultural &#8220;Other&#8221;. The second part of the dissertation examines the interpretive problems of Singapore Chinese literature in English translation based on the theory of the ethics of translation. Specifically, when a target text (TT) reader is construed as the cultural &#8220;Other&#8221; in a source text (ST), an interpretive paradox arises when the TT reader attempts to understand himself/herself as a cultural &#8220;Other&#8221; in his/her own language in order to achieve a positive ethics of translation. The TT reader faces an epistemological dilemma: he/she either betrays his/her own identity in favour of the identity function of the ST, thus setting on an ironic process of self-Othering, or adheres to his/her identity and betrays that of the ST, thus contradicting the intended objective of allowing the predominantly English-speaking Chinese community in Singapore to understand the cultural predicament of their Chinese-speaking counterparts. In the third part of the study, I explore the role of translation in the construction of language ideology in Singapore and the way in which this role has changed since the mid-1980s. Based on an analysis of the use of translation in the making of multilingual literary anthologies published between 1985 and 2008, it is found that the power relation between the English language and the mother tongue languages in Singapore has shifted over the past two decades. Central to this shift is translation, the discursive instrument in multilingual publications. While earlier anthologies adopt a &#8220;one-to-one&#8221; translation model, in which literary works written in the mother tongue languages are translated into English but not vice versa, more recent anthologies adopt a &#8220;many-to-many&#8221; translation model, in which various languages translate into one another. This shift leads to a subtle change in the relationship between English and the mother tongue languages, from an asymmetric one in favour of English as the language of power, to a balanced one that gives an equal &#8220;voice&#8221; to the mother tongue languages. The analysis shows that translation is the locus of complex language ideological struggles, and that it plays the conflicting roles of reinforcing the hegemony of the English language and of resisting such hegemony in Singapore. This study has three implications for translation studies. Firstly, it supports the case for the combination of textual and contextual approaches in the investigation of translation phenomena. Secondly, it suggests that translation practice in Singapore is a potentially paradoxical act whose efficacy is not unproblematic. Finally, the study enables translators and language policy makers in Singapore to become more aware of the ideological implication of translation in multilingual discourses, and to tap into the discursive power of translation in creating a truly balanced multilingual nation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">metonymics of translation, crisis of representation, ethics of translation, epistemological dilemma, symbolic power, ideological function</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179153</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accounting for ecosystem dynamics and uncertainty in conservation planning</field><field name="creator">Hedley Grantham</field><field name="description">A systematic approach to planning, decision-making and management has become best-practice in conservation over the past two of decades. The field of &#8216;systematic conservation planning&#8217; is concerned with identifying cost-effective places and actions to protect biological diversity. Past research has focused on static assessments. However, given the fact that biological diversity and processes that threaten its persistence vary in space and time, conservation assessments might need to be made in a dynamic context. In addition, we must explicitly account for the trade-offs associated with implementing conservation actions and investing in improved knowledge and learning to reduce uncertainty on where, how and when to act. The aim of this thesis was to develop novel approaches for accounting for both ecosystem dynamics and uncertainty in conservation planning. Ecosystems are generally treated as static in conservation planning despite many being spatially and temporally dynamic. For example, pelagic marine ecosystems are quite dynamic because ecological processes, such as eddies, that produce resources that many species depend on can be erratic. In chapter two we explored the issue of developing a system of fixed protected areas that consider the physical and biological dynamics typical of the pelagic realm. The approach was to maximize the representation of key fisheries species and species of conservation concern due to significant declines in their abundance, within a network of protected areas. We also ensured that protected area design reflected system dynamics and this was achieved by representing key oceanographic process (such as upwellings and eddies), and biological processes (such as the abundance of small pelagic fish) in protected areas. To account for the variability where these processes occur, we used time series data to find both predictable areas and anomalies, assuming that their past location was somewhat reflective of their future locations. Implementing conservation actions that are fixed in space and time are probably not the most effective strategy in ecosystems that are dynamic. This is because of the movements of particular species. For example, many species have distributions and abundances that change seasonally and might only require temporary management in particular areas. In chapter three, we tested the utility of three approaches to implementing fisheries closures to reduce bycatch in the South African Longline Fishery; 1) time closures, 2) permanent spatial closures and 3) episodic spatial closures. In chapter three, we identified these closures using an existing database containing catch and bycatch data from 1998 to 2005. There was variation where and when different species were caught as bycatch, and it was determined seasonal area closures were the best strategy. This was because it achieved the same conservation objectives for bycatch species as the other types of closures, but impacted less on the long-lining industry. While this result is intuitive, it demonstrated quantitatively, how much more effective moveable management can be. Decisions on where conservation actions are implemented are always based on incomplete knowledge about biological diversity. It is generally assumed that gathering more data is a good investment for conservation planning. However, data can take time and incur costs to collect and given habitat loss, there are both costs and benefits associated with different levels of investments in knowledge versus conservation implementation. In chapter four, the aim was to determine the return on investment from spending different amounts on survey data before undertaking a program of implementing new protected areas. We found that, after an investment of only US$100,000, there was little increase in the effectiveness of conservation actions, despite the full species dataset costing at least 25 times that amount. Surveying can take time because of expertise limitations, logistics and funding shortfalls. Biological diversity may be lost while data collection occurs conversely, not collecting enough data can lead to erroneous decisions. Additionally, resources spent on learning may be better spent on other actions. In chapter five, in a series of retrospective simulations, we compared the impact of spending different amounts of time collecting biological data prior to the implementation of new protected areas. The aim was to find the optimal survey period given the trade-off between gaining knowledge to improve conservation decisions while there is concurrent loss of habitat. We discovered that surveying beyond two years rarely increased the effectiveness of conservation decisions, despite a substantial increase in the knowledge of species distributions. Often there are choices between different actions and uncertainty as to which are the most effective. In chapter six, we discuss how the principles of adaptive management might be applied to conservation planning. Improving future management decisions through learning should be viewed as essential in all conservation plans but such learning is often included as a minor step, or is completely ignored. In this chapter we provide a brief overview of an adaptive framework for conservation planning and ideas for future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Systematic conservation planning</field><field name="subject">uncertainty</field><field name="subject">biodiversity surrogate</field><field name="subject">marine protected areas</field><field name="subject">Protea Atlas</field><field name="subject">Southern Benguela</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179193</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From the Art House to the Multiplex: An Exploration of Multiform Cinema</field><field name="creator">Matthew Campora</field><field name="description">This dissertation will examine the relationship between the narrative styles of the art cinema and those of mainstream contemporary American cinema. In particular: it will focus on a unique style of narration used in the art cinema since the early decades of the 20th century, contending that &#8220;multiform narrative&#8221;&#8212;a concept adopted from the work of Janet Murray&#8212;offers a useful framework for analyzing this style. The key structural features of the &#8220;multiform narrative&#8221; are its multiple narrative strands and multiple ontologies, and it is the latter feature that sets it apart from other narrative styles. It will argue that &#8220;multiform narratives&#8221; differ from the unified narratives of classical Hollywood cinema in their use of multiple narrative strands. However, they also differ from multi-strand narratives of American independent cinema in their use of multiple realities. The usefulness of the &#8220;multiform&#8221; as a category will be demonstrated through a consideration of a diverse group of films ranging from The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (Robert Weine, 1919) to Rashomon (Akira Kurosawa, 1951), as well as through contemporary multiple-ontology films such as Mulholland Drive (David Lynch, 2001), Memento (Christopher Nolan, 2000), and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (Michel Gondry, 2004). These contemporary films share many narrative and aesthetic characteristics of the earlier multiform films that have become exemplars of &#8220;modernist&#8221; and/or &#8220;art cinema,&#8221; even though they have emerged from very different social and institutional contexts. In this respect, the category of the &#8220;multiform&#8221; will be shown to offer both a flexibility and specificity that is not provided by earlier concepts. Consequently, it provides a framework for analyzing films from different movements and time periods with similar narrative structures that have yet to be considered together on this basis. As a result, the multiform will be shown to close a research gap in the field of complex narrative in the cinema and to provide a helpful refinement to the evolving taxonomy of narrative forms. In addition, it will be argued that a further distinction can be made within the category of the multiform itself through the identification of a style of multiform film that uses subjective realist narration to create its alternate ontological levels. Subjective realism presents the internal world of a character as if it were as real as other levels of narration and, in the films that will be considered, subjective realist strands are used to represent the dreams, hallucinations, and/or lying flashbacks of key characters within the films. A historical overview of subjective realist multiform cinema from 1919 to the present will be offered, and it will be argued that the innovative and challenging contemporary films which employ this narrative structure are aesthetically and narratively indebted to their precursors in the art cinema, but are also informed by recent technological developments as well as contemporary production and reception contexts. They will be shown to be part of a cycle of films emerging in the mid-1990s that has offered multiplex audiences narrative pleasures of the type formerly reserved for the denizens of art house cinema.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410000 The Arts</field><field name="subject">multiform narrative</field><field name="subject">complex narrative</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiotherapy in the Canine Intensive Care Setting: with focus on the effects of recumbency, the post-operative management of dogs with brachycephalic airway obstructive syndrome, and aspiration pneumonia following tick (Ixodes holocyclus) poisoning.</field><field name="creator">Helen Nicholson</field><field name="description">Abstract Introduction: Physiotherapy in the human intensive care setting is in common use and supported by Level 1 evidence. In the canine intensive care setting, however, physiotherapy is novel, despite many studies published to support aspects of human physiotherapy being conducted on experimental dogs and there being 83 canine intensive care beds in Sydney alone. As veterinary care progresses and people place more importance on their pet&#8217;s health care, an opportunity arises to examine the potential for physiotherapy to augment the veterinary care of client-owned dogs in a veterinary referral hospital setting. The first objective of this thesis was therefore to determine which common conditions cause dogs to present recumbent to veterinary referral hospitals, and then to conduct a literature review on these conditions and ways in which physiotherapy has the potential to add to the treatment of them. The next objective was to describe the short-term effects of recumbency on a number of key body systems in clinically unwell dogs, as concern was that recumbency itself may contribute to pathogenesis and/or poorer recovery, however this could not be investigated before preliminary studies like this were performed. The next objective was to conduct clinical trials of the use of two well-proven techniques in human physiotherapy on dogs with conditions commonly reported in the earlier studies of this thesis. The chosen techniques were continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to assist in the recovery of dogs with brachycephalic airway obstructive syndrome (BAOS) from general anaesthetic, and the use of manual chest physiotherapy in dogs with aspiration pneumonia following tick (Ixodes holocyclus) poisoning. Design: Retrospective epidemiological study; Literature review; Cross-sectional descriptive study; Randomised controlled trial; Clinical trial. Results: Dogs admitted recumbent represented 3.18% of total admissions, however had a confirmed survival rate of only 43.5%. Sydney canine intensive care units have a combined capacity of 83 beds, so many other dogs experience recumbency as part of their veterinary management, despite being admitted ambulant, and therefore also have the potential to benefit from physiotherapy. Diagnoses were split into categories, with suspected intervertebral disc disease the most common neurological diagnosis, hit by car the most common orthopaedic diagnosis, collapse the most common diagnosis in the &#8216;otherwise unwell&#8217; category and tick (Ixodes holocyclus) poisoning and poison (e.g. metaldehyde) ingestion the most common toxicology diagnosis, all of which have the potential to be just as amenable to physiotherapy in dogs as they are in people. However, interspecies comparisons revealed that although the dogs studied had broadly comparable diagnoses to humans, they had a higher mortality rate and received much less physiotherapy than humans. Key body systems were therefore measured in recumbent dogs, with the finding that the dogs included under the strict definition of recumbency in this study maintained a fairly consistent clinical state in the short-term of their period of recumbency (median days 3 to 5 of hospitalization). This finding supported the investigation of physiotherapy as a potential to not only reduce the mortality rate but to speed return to function, which has the potential to also lower the economic burden of prolonged hospitalization on owners. Continuous positive airway pressure was therefore investigated for its potential to improve the safety of recovery from general anaesthetic in dogs with BAOS. Tolerance and effect of CPAP were investigated with positive results demonstrated to improve time to recovery, with no additional distress, in dogs with BAOS recovering from a general anaesthetic. An evidence-based protocol of manual chest physiotherapy was then tested on dogs with aspiration pneumonia following tick (Ixodes holocyclus) poisoning. Demeanour, saturation of peripheral oxygen and auscultation all improved following the first manual chest physiotherapy session, demonstrating tolerance and effect. Conclusions: Primary recumbency is an uncommon but serious condition in dogs that warrants attention by physiotherapy researchers, as dogs admitted ambulant but who spend part of their hospitalization recumbent also have the potential to benefit. This thesis determined the common causes of recumbency in dogs and determined that key body systems of recumbent dogs are clinically stable without the assistance of physiotherapy to improve their short-term rate of recovery. Positive short-term results were yielded from the use of CPAP and manual chest physiotherapy that may benefit other clinically unwell dogs with similar respiratory conditions. Further research should be conducted into other ways in which physiotherapy can augment the care of recumbent dogs, as well as lower the mortality rate and speed the return to function in dogs in the intensive care setting, as it is possible that not all positive findings in human research were replicated in these studies due to Type II error resulting from small sample sizes due to abnormal weather patterns that reduced the number of presentations of dogs with BAOS or tick poisoning during the study period.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">animal physiotherapy</field><field name="subject">dog</field><field name="subject">recumbency</field><field name="subject">intensive care</field><field name="subject">chest</field><field name="subject">Non-invasive Ventilation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179224</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Secondary Metabolites from Durio Spp.: The Indigenous Indonesian Fruit Plant</field><field name="creator">Rudiyansyah</field><field name="description">The goal of this PhD research was directed to the isolation and structural elucidation of the secondary metabolites from four species of Durio plants, especially from those growing in the island of Borneo; This island contains most Durio species. The structures of isolated compounds were deduced using state-of-the-art approaches, including 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), mass spectrometric (MS) and circular dichroism (CD) analyses. From the bark of the woody species Durio zibethinus Murr. (Bombacaceae), that was collected in Pontianak, a chemically diverse group of oxygenated compounds was obtained. These included caffeoyl triterpenes, lignans and phenylpropanoid derivatives. During this research, one new compound 27-O-cis-caffeoylcylicodiscate was obtained which resulted from a trans to cis isomerization; this process might be caused by acid and light. Two presumed fungal metabolites were also isolated during this study, these possibly arising from fungal (unknown species) contamination of the bark. The relative stereochemistry of 4-hydroxymellein were also established by conversion to it diacetate and measurement of the coupling constant between H-3 and H-4. The absolute configuration was determined by comparison of [&#61537;]D values with those from the literature. Assignment of the 13C NMR spectrum for (+)-(R)-de-O-methyllasiodiplodin was completed using HSQC-TOCSY data. The methanol extract of the bark of Durio kutejensis (Hassk.) Becc. was fractionated and purified by C18-HPLC. Two new caffeoyl pentacyclic triterpenes 3&#61538;-O-trans-caffeoyl-2&#61537;-hydroxyolean-12-en-28-oic acid and 3&#61538;-O-trans-caffeoyl-2&#61537;-hydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid, together with five known compounds were isolated. The known compound fraxidin had previously been obtained from D. zibethinus Murr. The bark of Durio carinatus Mast., a plant species which has non edible fruit was collected in Sambas district, West Kalimantan. Three new lignans, boehmenan X, (-)-(7S,8S)-threo-carolignan X and (-)-(7R,8S)-erythro-carolignan X, and a new caffeoyl triterpene 3&#61538;-O-cis-caffeoyl betulinic acid, together with three known lignans and one known caffeoyl triterpene, were obtained from the crude MeOH extract. The relative configurations and conformational models of the diastereomers threo- and erythro-carolignan X were determined by the coupling constant data for H-7&#8242; and H-8&#8242; and supported by 2D NMR spectroscopic analysis including NOESY and HSQC-HECADE in CDCl3. However, the magnitude of the coupling constants for both compounds in MeOH-d4 was similar. The stability of the individual conformers was solvent dependent and must be considered for their contribution to the overall conformational equilibria. This stability was determined by steric interactions, dipole repulsion effects and intramolecular hydrogen bonding. The absolute configuration of the two new diastereomers was established by application of circular dichroism (CD) and optical rotation [&#61537;]D measurements. Another Durio plant studied and collected in Bengkayang region, West Kalimantan, was Durio oxleyanus Griff. From the MeOH extract of its bark, two new lignans, (-)-(7S,8S)-threo-carolignan Y and (-)-(7R,8S)-erythro-carolignan Y were isolated using C18-HPLC. The relative stereochemistry of the carolignan Y diastereomers could not be deduced from the coupling constants for H-7&#8242; and H-8&#8242; either in CDCl3 and MeOH-d4, because of the presence of multiple conformers. The conformational model for the diastereomers of carolignan Y was similar to that of threo- and erythro-carolignan X in MeOH-d4. Using 2D NMR spectroscopic methods, including NOESY and HSQC-HECADE, the relative stereochemistry of the threo and erythro isomers of carolignan Y was confirmed. Further, the absolute configuration of threo- and erythro-carolignan Y was explored via analysis of CD spectra and by comparison of experimentally obtained [&#61537;]D values with literature values.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">durio</field><field name="subject">caffeoyl</field><field name="subject">triterpene</field><field name="subject">lignan</field><field name="subject">threo</field><field name="subject">erythro</field><field name="subject">HSQC-HECADE</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179225</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Caulerpa taxifolia growth dynamics and habitat value of native and invasive populations</field><field name="creator">Dana Burfeind</field><field name="description">Caulerpa taxifolia is a marine alga notorious for its introduction and subsequent colonization of the Mediterranean Sea. It is recognized as one of the 100 worst invasive species, and it is suggested that much of its expansion may have been at the expense of native seagrass beds. To date, the bulk of research on C. taxifolia has centred on quantifying expansion and methods of eradication. There are few quantitative data on the relationship between C. taxifolia growth and environmental characteristics (e.g. light, temperature, nutrients). Furthermore, once C. taxifolia has been introduced to a system it is exceptionally difficult and expensive to eradicate. Accordingly the implications, both positive and negative, of this new habitat type must be considered in the context of the new habitat mosaic into which it fits. Australia is unique in that it has both native and invasive populations of C. taxifolia. These populations offer not only an opportunity to examine the dynamics of C. taxifolia beds and their associated communities at different latitudes and temperature and light regimes, but especially in the context of a high diversity marine coastal environment. The objectives of this thesis were to use native (Moreton Bay, Queensland) and invasive (Pittwater, New South Wales and Port River, South Australia) populations of C. taxifolia to: 1) quantify the relationship between environmental drivers (light, temperature, nutrients) and C. taxifolia growth, and 2) examine differences in habitat use and function between seagrass, C. taxifolia, unvegetated substrate. Most of the locations in Australia where large C. taxifolia beds occur are adjacent to urban areas that have a degraded water quality. Manipulative experiments in Moreton Bay demonstrated that nutrients stimulate C. taxifolia growth, however, light availability and seasonality appear to influence the response of C. taxifolia growth to nutrients. Short-term manipulative experiments were conducted across a range of seasons and locations, to capture the effects of temperature on growth. Temperature was the dominant factor affecting rate of stolon extension in both native and invasive locations. Colonization potential of C. taxifolia appears to be driven by ambient water quality (light and nutrients) and bed expansion is driven by temperature in systems where nutrients are saturating. Epifaunal communities sampled by beam trawl were dominated by the families Palaeomonidae, Terapontidae, Scorpaenidae, Monacanthidae, Syngnathidae, Gobiidae, and were largely similar between seagrasses and C. taxifolia; however, syngnathids were absent from C. taxifolia beds. I examined habitat use patterns between seagrass (Zostera muelleri), C. taxifolia, and unvegetated substrate. Fish preferred seagrass to C. taxifolia; however, in the absence of a seagrass fish used C. taxifolia. While C. taxifolia may have similar structural benefits to some seagrasses, there are fewer food resources available within C. taxifolia beds. Furthermore, grazing may be limited to a few specialist grazers. Within the habitat mosaic, C. taxifolia will provide some benefit over an unvegetated substrate; however, that benefit might mask losses in system quality or resilience by decreasing the threshold level for change within the community. Therefore, should a perturbation occur (e.g. sudden drop in water temperature, filamentous algal bloom) a system comprised solely of seagrass could withstand such stress; however, a habitat mosaic of seagrass and C. taxifolia could have a rapid and dramatic loss in its ability to sustain a diverse faunal community. Ultimately, it is most important to protect the system from anthropogenic degradation so it is more resilient to environmental changes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">algal growth</field><field name="subject">Caulerpa Taxifolia</field><field name="subject">faunal density</field><field name="subject">grazing</field><field name="subject">growth</field><field name="subject">habitat</field><field name="subject">invasive species</field><field name="subject">seagrass</field><field name="subject">water quality</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179226</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SMALL FIRM INTERNATIONALISATION: A PHENOMENOGRAPHIC APPROACH</field><field name="creator">Peter Lamb</field><field name="description">This study investigates small firm internationalisation from an individual owner-manager&#8217;s perspective. Despite advancing our understanding of small firm internationalisation, process-based theories including the Uppsala, innovation-related and networks explanations, and more recently entrepreneurial-based theories remain vague in relation to what characterises and constitutes the internationalisation practices of small owner-managed firms. Process theories overlook the owner-manager and their practices, while entrepreneurial explanations focus on individual characteristics to the exclusion of their internationalisation practices. Furthermore, existing explanations are constrained by rationalistic assumptions prevalent in small firm internationalisation research which de-emphasise comprehensiveness, connectedness and complexity in favour of de-contextualised parsimonious causal relationships, thereby limiting investigations into how owner-managers understand and practice firm internationalisation. As a way forward, an alternative interpretive lens is adopted using a phenomenographic approach to explore how owner-managers understand and practise firm internationalisation. Consequently, the owner-manager&#8217;s lived experiences of firm internationalisation provide the point of departure for this study. In-depth interviews with owner-managers of small internationalising wineries, together with observations, field notes, documentation and secondary data formed the basis of my empirical material which was analysed in two-stages. The material was initially analysed in terms of what constituted firm internationalisation practice, and was subsequently examined to explore how owner-managers understand firm internationalisation. A small firm internationalisation activity cycle comprising: assessing and knowing markets, prospecting and attracting agent interest, assessing agent compatibility, supporting and sustaining agent relationships and termination or failure of agent relationships emerged as what constituted their internationalisation practice. Subsequent analysis revealed how owner-managers understood firm internationalisation by identifying four qualitatively different understandings of firm internationalisation practices: seeking market knowledge, competing on price, portraying distinctiveness and storytelling. The internationalisation activity cycle and the understandings of firm internationalisation were later connected to form an understanding-based theory of small firm internationalisation. This study contributes to small firm internationalisation theory in two ways: first, the articulation of an on-going and inter-connected internationalisation activity cycle of the small firm extends existing theories by providing a more complete and accurate explanation of how owner-managers of small firms conduct their internationalisation practices. It makes visible the activities, processes and relationships obscured by existing theories. The internationalisation activity cycle, through the inter-relatedness of each of the activities concurrently, combines market knowledge processes with processes of attracting, building and replacing network relationships with domestic and foreign-based actors. Second, revealing different understandings of internationalisation practices of small owner-managed firms, and associating these understandings of internationalisation with their internationalisation activity cycle not only extends existing theories but offers a new explanation of small firm internationalisation. An understanding-based theory of small firm internationalisation advocates that variations in conduct and activities undertaken by owner-managers are determined by their different understandings of firm internationalisation. As a result, owner-managers attach different meanings to the activities within the internationalisation activity cycle as they conduct their internationalisation practices. Consequently, the variability and idiosyncratic nature of small firm internationalisation is captured as one of multiplicity, rather than demanding universal explanation proposed by existing theories.

This has created opportunities to do science that would otherwise be difficult or impossible. At the same time, astronomers have acknowledged that this in&#64258;ux of data creates new challe nges in the development of tools and practice to facilitate usage of this technology by the international community. A world wide e&#64256;ort known as the Virtual Observatory has developed to this end involving collaborations between astronomers, computer scientists and statisticians. Di&#64256;erent telescopes survey the sky in di&#64256;erent wavelengths producing catalogues of objects con- taining observations of both positional and non-positional properties. Because multiple catalogues exist, a common situation is that there are two catalogues containing observations of the same piece of sky (e.g. one sparse catalogue with relatively few objects per unit area, and one dense catalogue with many more objects per unit area). Identifying matches i.e. di&#64256;erent observations of the same object in di&#64256;erent catalogues is an important step in building a multi-wavelength understanding of the universe. Positional properties of objects can be used in some cases to perform catalogue matching, however in other cases position alone is insufficient to determine matching objects. This thesis applies machine learning and statistical methods to explore the usefulness of non- positional properties in identifying these matching objects common in two di&#64256;erent catalogues. A machine learning classi&#64257;cation system is shown to be able to identify these objects in a particu- lar problem domain. It is shown that non-positional inputs can be very bene&#64257;cial in identifying matches for a particular problem. The result is that supervised learning is shown to be a viable method to be applied in difficult catalogue matching problems. The use of probabilistic outputs is developed as an enhancement in order to give a means of iden- tifying the uncertainty in the matches. Something that distinguishes this problem from standard pattern classi&#64257;cation problems is that one class, the match es, belong to a high dimensional dis- tribution where the non-matches belong to a lower dimensional distribution. This assumption is developed in a probabilistic framework. The result of this is a class of probability models useful for catalogue matching and a number of tests for the suitability of the computed probabilities. The tests were applied on a problem and showed a good classi&#64257;cati on rate, good results obtained by scoring rules and good calibration. Visual inspection of the output also suggested that algorithm was behaving in a sensible way. While reasonable results are obtained, it is acknowledged that the question of is the probability a good probability is philosophically awkward. One goal of analysing astronomical matched or unmatched catalogues is in order to make accurate inferential statements on the basis of the available data. A silent assumption is often made that the &#64257;rst step in analysing unmatched catalogues is to &#64257;nd the best match between them, then to plot this best-match data assuming it to be correct. This thesis shows that this assumption is false, inferential statements based on the best match data can potentially be quite misleading. To address this problem a new framework for catalogue matching, based on Bayesian statistics is developed. In this Bayesian framework it is unnecessary for the method to commit to a single matched dataset; rather the ensemble of all possible matches can be used. This method compares favourably to other methods either based upon choosing the most likely match. The result of this is the outline of a method for analysing astronomical datasets not by a scatter plot obtained from the perfectly known pre-matched list of data, but rather using predictive distributions which need not be based on a perfect list and indeed might be based upon unmatched or partly matched catalogues.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="subject">Machine Learning</field><field name="subject">Astronomy</field><field name="subject">Bayesian statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179251</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantum Information and Quantum Computation with Continuous Variables</field><field name="creator">Christian Weedbrook</field><field name="description">The idea to assimilate classical information theory with quantum mechanics resulted in the creation of a new field in physics known as quantum information. One of the first papers in this new field occurred in the early 1970's when Stephen Wiesner wrote the seminal manuscript titled: "Conjugate Coding". However, its importance wasn't imme- diately recognized and wasn't published until 1983. The 1980's and 1990's saw a number of important papers published in quantum information leading to the subfields of quantum cryptography, quantum teleportation, quantum entanglement, distinguishability of quantum states, and quantum cloning. It was also during the 1980's, that a new model of computing, known as quantum computation, was beginning to emerge. It offered the possibility of solving certain problems faster than a classical computer by exploiting various properties of quantum mechanics. Research in this field was undoubtedly stimulated by a well known talk given by Richard Feynman in 1981 at MIT on quantum simulations. Both quantum information and quantum computation were initially developed with quantum discrete variables in mind. However, over the course of the last decade, there has been a significant increase in using quantum continuous variables. This thesis will focus on the topic of quantum information and quantum computation using continuous variables. Specifically, we will theoretically consider the cloning of continuous-variable entanglement, the distinguishability of Gaussian states, new continuous-variable quantum cryptography protocols and finally, the universality of quantum computation using continuous-variable cluster states.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Continuous variables, quantum information, quantum computation, quantum cloning, quantum cryptography, distinguishability, quantum entanglement.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179268</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Silica Membrane Reactor For The Low Temperature Water Gas Shift Reaction</field><field name="creator">Scott Battersby</field><field name="description">Coal gasification is currently being developed as a cleaner alternative to conventional combustion technology. To optimise H2 production in this process, a water gas shift reaction is utilised to convert all CO with H2O to produce CO2 and H2. Typically industrial processes involve a two-step reaction system followed by a downstream H2 purification system, though attracting significant inefficiencies and high capital costs. Replacing a conventional unit process with a membrane reactor in this application is foreseen to provide major advantages: &#8226; Removing H2 from the reaction in-situ, a membrane reactor can minimise downstream processing and associated capital and operational costs. &#8226; Shift the reaction to higher conversions, improving efficiencies and reducing CO in the outlet. &#8226; Provide a purified H2 stream for use in PEM fuel cells, while concentrating the CO2 stream at high pressure for possible sequestration. If the concept of membrane reactor is to be adopted in coal gasification, important material improvements and operational challenges must be overcome before commercialisation can be realised. In addition, the water gas shift reaction has only recently gained interest for membrane reactors and is currently lacking comprehensive research on the effects of operating conditions on both the conversion and separation found within the unit. To this end, these are strong motivations of this work to contribute with knowledge in this field of research. This thesis examines the effects of operating conditions such as temperature, pressure, space velocity, sweep gas rate and feed water ratio on the performance of a water gas shift membrane reactor as compared with a conventional reactor. Novel cobalt silica molecular sieve membranes were used with conventional low temperature water gas shift reaction CuZnAl2O3 catalysts. Two type of membrane reactor configuration were investigated: a small flat template with catalyst on the feed side, and a scale up tube membrane with catalyst placed also in feed stream, the inner shell of the tube membrane. The cobalt silica membranes complied with activated transport, following a flux dependency gas permeation, where He and H2 permeance increased with temperature whilst N2, CO and CO2 showed the opposite effect. Best single gas selectivities were very high, with values of 4500 (He/N2) and 1100 (H2/CO2). In addition, the energy of activation for He and H2 was also very high, in excess of 9-10 kJ.mol-1, clearly indicating the high quality of the membranes employed in this study. It was found that the MR improved CO conversions for a range of space velocities as a function of temperature, which was attributed to both activate transport property of the membrane and increased conversion. Below equilibrium limits this provided an improved H2 production of 5 &#8211; 12% at 200-250oC as the removal of H2 through the membrane allowed enhanced conversion. With a set feed rate, the optimum advantage of the MR was seen at a water ratio of 1 as the lower equilibrium limits allowed greater potential for conversion enhancement. With increasing excess water this advantage decreased from 7% down to 0.5% at 300oC. The use of pressure and sweep rate was used to optimise the membranes permeation rate and selectivity. While pressure (or driving force) provided the highest potential for increasing permeation (or flow rate), temperature in tandem with pressure provided the greatest improvement in membrane selectivity, thus increasing H2 concentration from 95 &#8211; 99% in the permeate stream. Detailed study of permeate concentrations with changing conditions was undertaken to provide an understanding of the transport properties of silica membranes. It was observed that membrane selectivity and permeation decreased with the gas composition (ie Single&gt;Binary&gt;Ternary). Nevertheless, for separation of a ternary mixture at increased temperatures (250oC) the membrane could provide up to 99% purified H2 while reducing CO down to 700ppm. Competitive gas permeation regimes are an industrial reality which is seldom addressed in membranes for high temperature gas separation. The effect of gas mixtures on permeation and selectivity was attributed to several factors: chemical potential (or driving force) of the feed gas mixture, blockage of micropores by large molecules (CO2 and CO) which in turn affects the percolation of H2. As a result, gas separation was reduced for higher CO and CO2 feed concentrations, leading to a significant reduction in the H2 flow rate. Temperature played a vital role in this competitive process, as H2 diffusivity and CO, CO2 adsorption followed an inverse trend. Thus, increasing temperature led to higher H2 pore diffusivity, while decreasing the competitive effect of CO and CO2 adsorption. The use of cobalt modified silica to improve the hydrothermal stability of the membranes was investigated for use in the water gas shift reaction. It was found that the addition of cobalt stabilised the silica pore network, maintaining microporosity after exposure to steam. This is validated with long term stability testing in a water gas shift membrane reactor, where it was seen that the membrane could provide up to 95% H2 concentration in the permeate for over 200hrs of MR operation. This provided novel work, establishing the feasibility of these membranes for long term testing and operation in an industrial WGS MR.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">silica</field><field name="subject">Metal doped</field><field name="subject">Membrane reactor</field><field name="subject">Water Gas Shift</field><field name="subject">H2 separation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179288</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental Study and Modelling of Non-equilibrium Radiation During Titan and Martian Entry</field><field name="creator">Aaron Brandis</field><field name="description">The predictions of non-equilibrium radiation for a Titan aerocapture aeroshell vary significantly amongst Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analyses and are limited by the physical models of the non-equilibrium &#64258;ow. Of particular interest are the non-equilibrium processes associated with the cyanogen (CN) molecule which is known to be a strong radiator. It is therefore important to have experimental data for these radiating shock layers which will allow for validation of CFD models. Furthermore, a more detailed understanding of the chemical processes that lead to the formation of CN above equilibrium concentration is required. This thesis describes the modelling of the radiation behind a shock using a collisional-radiative (CR) model and presents measurements of radiation intensity behind a shock in simulated Titan and Martian atmospheres. The uncertainties in radiation is more signi&#64257;cant at lower speeds (around 5-8 km/s) with these atmospheres when compared to Earth entry. This is due to the formation of CN and because of the highly non-equilibrium nature of the &#64258;ow. The motivation for this work began with the successful landing of the Huygens probe on the surface of Titan which led to the renewed interest in inter-planetary missions. Thus radiative heating during atmospheric entry to Titan and Mars was the subject of several experimental campaigns and extensive computational analyses. In order to better understand the formation of CN, and the nonequilibrium radiation emitted under such atmospheric conditions, NASA Ames Research Center conducted a series of experiments on their Electric Arc Shock Tube facility, EAST. Furthermore, several research groups in Europe and the United States independently developed CR models to predict the measured levels of radiation. The results from these simulations showed some ma jor discrepancies and highlighted a lack of knowledge and understanding about the fundamental physics behind the formation and decay of the CN molecule and its associated excited states. Based on a comparison of the various simulations with the CR models and the EAST experimental data, it was concluded that the absolute level of peak radiation was well predicted, however, there was a signi&#64257;cant discrepancy related to the decay rate of the radiation. Therefore, to add to the relatively small amount of experimental data for these highly non-equilibrium radiating &#64258;ow conditions, experiments were performed on the X2 shock tube at The University of Queensland with the aim of producing a comprehensive set of benchmark data for Titan entry. The data obtained from these experiments have been used to validate the results from the NASA Ames testing, and due to the large parametric variation, as a source for code validation. In addition to the experimental component of this thesis, an investigation into the simulation of CN non-equilibrium radiation was conducted. It has been previously concluded that there was a signi&#64257;cant discrepancy between the experimentally measured radiation decay rate and the predicted value from CR models. Therefore, the primary aim of the simulation work presented in this thesis is to explain the reason behind this discrepancy. Through a parametric study of important reactions combined with an analysis of the reaction set, it was concluded that the coupling between the dissociation of N2 and the formation of CN (through the reaction N2 + C &#8596; CN + N) controlled the radiation decay rate. The reason for the super equilibrium concentrations was identi&#64257;ed to be a result of the N2 + C &#8596; CN + N reaction continuing to over-produce CN after nominal equilibrium values are reached. This is due to the slow build up of N to drive the reverse reaction. Thus it has been shown in this thesis that the behaviour of the CN concentration is controlled by the rate of N2 dissociation. This led to the implementation of a more thorough method for simulating the dissociation process of molecular nitrogen. Therefore, a mono-quantum vibration state speci&#64257;c model that includes excitation and de-excitation reactions for all the vibrational states of nitrogen was incorporated into the CR model developed by Magin et al. The nitrogen vibration state speci&#64257;c model that was implemented was developed by Pierott and is based on SSH theory. The model developed in this thesis is known as the ViSpeN CR model (Vibrationally Speci&#64257;c Nitrogen). The ViSpeN results show signi&#64257;cantly better agreement with experimental data in terms of the decay rate, initial rise of the radiation and the overall trends in the data. However, the work in this thesis has shown there are still discrepancies in predicting the absolute level of radiation measured in shock tunnel experiments. This led to the development of a modi&#64257;cation to the ViSpeN model (known as ViSpeN-L) which includes a proposed new value for the radiative lifetime of the CN violet transition. The agreement between the experimental data and the ViSpeN-L model is excellent for conditions relevant to Titan entry.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Non-equilibrium Radiation</field><field name="subject">Titan</field><field name="subject">Mars</field><field name="subject">Cyanogen</field><field name="subject">Collisional-Radiative Models</field><field name="subject">Shock Tubes</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179293</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of Adiponectin Receptor Structure and Function</field><field name="creator">Hayley Charlton</field><field name="description">Obesity and its associated metabolic complications are major burdens upon health systems globally highlighting the need for basic research into therapeutic targets to treat such disorders. The circulating hormone adiponectin has protective effects against several obesity-associated metabolic complications including insulin-resistance, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Recent studies have elucidated the beneficial metabolic effects of adiponectin yet the molecular mechanisms behind its actions remain poorly characterised. The recent discovery of two receptors of adiponectin in 2003, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, promises to further our understanding of how adiponectin mediates such effects. AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 are predicted to be seven transmembrane domain proteins (7TMs), however, they are considered unique to other 7TMs such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) since they have been shown to exhibit a reversed topology and also activate a distinct set of signalling molecules. Owing to their recent discovery and a lack of essential tools to permit basic research into adiponectin receptor (AdipoR) biology, our knowledge of these receptors remains extremely limited. The aim of this thesis was to generate tools and further characterise AdipoR structure and function in order to advance our understanding of how adiponectin&#8217;s effects are mediated. Early chapters in this thesis focus upon the generation and characterisation of fundamental molecular tools such as AdipoR mammalian expression plasmids and cell lines. Using these tools, we confirm that each AdipoR localises to the plasma membrane (PM) and does indeed possess a reversed topology to GPCRs; having an intracellular amino terminus and an extracellular carboxyl terminus. AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 are able to form both homo and hetero-multimers, as shown for numerous GPCR proteins, but neither receptor appears to be modified by N-linked glycosylation, a common modification of GPCRs. AdipoR-specific polyclonal antibodies were also generated and characterised in early chapters which allowed detection of endogenous AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 protein in multiple cell lines as well as primary human adipocytes. These studies revealed that AdipoRs are not only expressed in a variety of cell lines but also exhibit differential expression profiles suggesting AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 may mediate distinct functions of adiponectin. A major finding of this thesis was the discovery of a novel AdipoR1-interacting protein, ERp46. This is the first AdipoR1-specific interacting protein identified and only the second AdipoR-interacting protein described to date. ERp46 (also known as EndoPDI and pcTRP) has been previously described although knowledge of its function and cell biology is very limited. ERp46 co-immunoprecipitated with AdipoR1 in several different cell lines and showed no evidence of interaction with AdipoR2. Via immunofluorescence microscopy, ectopically expressed ERp46 localised to both the PM and intracellular structures, likely to be the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) whilst subcellular fractionation revealed that endogenous ERp46 localised to the ER-containing and PM-containing fractions in both HeLa and HEK cell lines. In silico analyses predict that ERp46 has a transmembrane domain and exhibits an extracellular / luminal carboxyl terminus, the latter of which was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy studies using epitope-tagged ERp46 constructs. Given that ERp46 primarily localises to the ER, we assessed whether ERp46 was involved in regulation of AdipoR trafficking. ShRNA knockdown of ERp46 resulted in increased AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 expression at the PM providing evidence to support a functional role in AdipoR biology. The presence of ERp46 at the PM, together with the data suggesting ERp46 regulates AdipoR subcellular localisation, led to studies investigating whether ERp46 contributes to adiponectin signalling. We demonstrate that adiponectin treatment results in the phosphorylation of key adiponectin targets (such as AMPK and p38MAPK) in HeLa cells and present data to support the requirement of ERp46 for specific adiponectin-induced signalling events. Furthermore, our studies show that ERp46 is not only involved in adiponectin-induced signalling but also in specific signalling events induced by insulin and epidermal growth factor (EGF) treatment. In summary, the work presented in this thesis confirms the findings of the initial publication in which the receptors were described and also identifies several novel features of the adiponectin receptors previously not reported. The identification of an AdipoR1-specific interacting protein that modulates both the localisation and signalling events of adiponectin is of particular interest. The data described in this thesis supports emerging evidence which suggests that AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 have distinct roles in adiponectin signalling and as such, this work has provided further insights into the mechanisms behind adiponectin action and provides a basis for future studies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">adiponectin</field><field name="subject">adipoR1</field><field name="subject">adipoR2</field><field name="subject">ERp46</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179294</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epidemiological Studies of Health and Performance in Pony Club Horses</field><field name="creator">Petra Buckley</field><field name="description">A mixed methods approach was applied to investigate horse health and performance in Pony Club horses. The qualitative phase (in-depth interviews) explored owners&#8217; perceptions of horse health and performance, whilst the quantitative phase (prospective longitudinal study) identified key health and performance problems with associated risk factors in a cohort of Pony Club horses. Quantitative analytical methods included descriptive, logistic regression and negative binomial regression analyses. Data quality and therefore internal and external validity were improved by preceding the longitudinal study with the qualitative phase. Horse health was not a well defined concept among participants, preventive health care was rarely practiced and other routine health care were administered on an ad hoc basis. Owners of Pony Club horses were concerned about their horses&#8217; welfare, but resorted to non-veterinary sources for advice on horse health. Farriers, chiropractors and equine dentists performed the majority of health care. This observed absence of veterinary involvement in preventive and routine health care matched owners&#8217; perceptions of veterinarians as disease experts whom they consulted for emergencies or as a last resort. Coupled with the apparent absence of pre-purchase examinations these findings raise serious concerns about the veterinary impact on the health of Pony Club horses. It was concluded that opportunities exist to improve the veterinary involvement with Pony Clubs and facilitate the extension of appropriate horse health type information. The health of Pony Club horses was found to be suboptimal with musculoskeletal and dermatological problems the most common diseases identified. High prevalences of lameness and sore backs were observed, but owner sensitivity of their detection was extremely low. Several of the horse-level risk factors identified, including height and breed for lameness, and height breed and gender for sore backs, were only alterable at the time of purchase. This suggests that owners may be at risk of purchasing horses with existing disease conditions, particularly in the absence of a veterinary examination. Other risk factors for sore backs, including housing, exercise, and body condition score could be reasoned on biomechanical grounds. An important outcome of this study was the following definition of a healthy horse: one free from pain and mentally and physically fit to participate regularly in the full range of required activities. An inextricable link between horse performance, exercise and behaviour was revealed during in-depth interviews. Initial intentions of using misbehaviour as a surrogate measure of poor performance were discarded resulting in an investigation of poor performance associated with misbehaviour, but not poor performance attributable to factors other than misbehaviour. Horses were generally exercised infrequently during each month, and this varied with season, with individual sessions lasting less than one hour. In terms of horse fitness these infrequent riding days suggest lack of strategy towards improving horse and rider skills and fitness. Another key outcome was a universally applicable definition of horse performance for Pony Club horses: good performance is considered to have occurred when the horse meets rider expectations. This is the first time that incidence of misbehaviour and associated risk factors have been described in a population of horses. Misbehaviour was more common during schooling and competing relative to pleasure riding, and more than half of the misbehaviour events were considered dangerous. Horse height, breed, and rider age were identified as risk factors for horse misbehaviour with tall Pony breeds ridden by teenagers the most likely to misbehave. The results highlighted the need to consider non-veterinary stakeholders, such as riders and Pony Club instructors, in programs to reduce misbehaviour in Pony Club horses. The study horses were kept predominantly at pasture in paddocks. The pastures these horses grazed represented an underused nutritional resource. Dietary supplements were commonly fed and often in excess. Involving agronomists to improve these horse pastures and employing simple monitoring tools such as body condition scoring more effectively will reduce reliance on expensive supplemental feeds as well as reduce the risk of obesity related disorders. Furthermore, pasture improvement coupled with strategic pasture rotation of horses and other livestock offers prospects for internal parasite control through less reliance on anthelmintics. The incidence of colic was very low in study horses, possibly due to the predominantly pasture-based diet and lifestyle of study horses. However, this same diet may have contributed to the high frequency of laminitis. Laminitis affected 24% of horses for part or all of the study, with 85 % of affected horses suffering recurring lameness and / or laminitis. Purchase of horses with chronic laminitis must be carefully considered due to this high frequency of recurrence. These findings suggest that more regular veterinary contact with Pony Club horses is desirable and would provide opportunities for owners to obtain veterinary advice on preventive health care. This veterinary contact could commence with a pre-purchase examination, and continue with comprehensive annual health checks. To achieve this, Pony Club veterinarians may have to become pro-active in marketing services beyond the treatment of disease to this sector of the equine industry.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pony club, mixed method, longitudinal, qualitative, epidemiology, pleasure horse, health, performance, risk factor, horse</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179306</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Defeat and Failure in Livy: Livy&#8217;s Presentation of Several Prominent Romans and the Roles They Played in his History of the Second Punic War.</field><field name="creator">Paula Marguerite Johnson</field><field name="description">The Second Punic War, fought between the Romans and Carthaginians, lasted for seventeen years. During this time the Carthaginians inflicted several devastating defeats upon Roman armies. In addition to the cost in human lives, these defeats left a legacy of shame which the Romans were anxious to extirpate. An important part of this process lay in the public perception of these events, and the ones most responsible for shaping this perception were the historians who recorded and wrote about them. Historiography in Rome was in its infancy as the Second Punic War drew to an end, and none of the accounts written by men who lived through the war have survived intact. The fullest and most detailed account of these years is that of Livy who, writing two centuries later, inherited the fruits of two centuries of historiography on the subject. Yet contrary to the belief that has persisted too long, Livy was not merely a collator and copyist, but a moralist and an artist with a vision of his own. For Livy, the period of the Second Punic War represents the Romans at their greatest, before the evils of foreign immorality and luxury took root and led eventually to the excessive greed and intense rivalry which tore the state apart. Thus it is not only patriotism, but also nostalgia, that colours Livy&#8217;s memorable presentation of these events and the people involved. Nobody denies Livy&#8217;s literary artistry, but it is the choices he has made in his interpretation of people and events that are of more interest to me. It was Livy&#8217;s cherished belief that the Romans of old, exemplars of courage and strict morality, were well nigh unbeatable in a fair fight, which makes the presentation of episodes of defeat and disgrace so much more challenging for him. A close examination of the ancient evidence, and in some cases a re-evaluation of modern perceptions concerning episodes of defeat and disgrace and the people involved, has allowed me to better grasp the extent of Livy&#8217;s artistic licence and reinterpretation. The evidence and opinions of Polybius have played a crucial role in this process, not only because of his closer proximity to the events in question, but because Livy is known to have read and used his work. Polybius&#8217; influence on Livy&#8217;s later decades concerning Rome&#8217;s involvement with Greek states is undeniable, but although Polybius wrote about the Second Punic War also, Livy has remained remarkably independent of Polybius&#8217; account. A comparison of these accounts reveals the difference in the choices made by each author and serves to illuminate what makes Livy&#8217;s history his own.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430000 History and Archaeology</field><field name="subject">Trebia, Trasimene, Cannae, Scipio, Marcellus, Fabius Maximus, Varro, Flaminius, Minucius, Livy, Polybius, Plutarch.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of the biology, ecology and control of berry diseases of Coffea arabica L. in Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Mark Kulie Kenny</field><field name="description">The objectives of studies undertaken here were to identify the species of Colletotrichum associated with coffee berry anthracnose in PNG, gain an understanding of the infection process and factors affecting it, assess the impact, if any, of anthracnose on coffee quality and identify suitable chemicals for anthracnose control. A total of 40 isolates were collected from PNG and their cultural and morphological characteristics on PDA were studied and used to identify the species. Species identification was further confirmed by molecular characterisation using RFLP and DNA sequencing of the ITS region of the rDNA. After species identification only two isolates were selected to represent C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum for further studies. Studies on conidia germination and the effects of conidia concentration, temperature, relative humidity and pH affecting germination were done on TWA, followed by studies on the infection process on coffee berries and the influence of temperature on germination and appressoria formation in vivo. For assessment of effect of anthracnose on coffee quality, 100 samples of ripe berries were assessed for disease incidence, followed by processing of the berries to green bean and data on bean defects (black bean) together with anthracnose incidence subjected to appropriate statistical analysis. A similar procedure was followed using disease severity but the samples were from one farm only. The closing work on chemical control was done by screening 16 different fungicides for the control of C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum. With the 40 isolates, 29 were identified as C. gloeosporioides and 11 as C. acutatum. This is the first report of C. acutatum on coffee in PNG. Identification of the species was further confirmed by RFLP groupings where C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum were separated at 574bp and 584bp respectively and DNA sequence homology identified the PNG isolates with C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum accessions. Optimum conditions for conidia germination in relation to spore concentration, temperature, and pH are 1 x 106 spores/ml, 21 - 29&#176;C and pH 5 - 7 respectively for C. acutatum and for C. gloeosporioides 1 x 106 spores/ml, 25 - 31&#176;C and pH 5 - 7 respectively. Humidity is not a limiting factor for activity of both species. Infection process for both species is similar where conidia germinate to produce the germ tube which swells at the tip to form the appressoria. The appressoria produce an infection peg which is responsible for berry cuticle penetration and cell colonisation (resulting in typical anthracnose symptom expression) and eventual sporulation. C. acutatum has not been reported elsewhere as a pathogen of coffee and this is the first report of C. acutatum causing infections on both ripe and mature green berries. Anthracnose incidence did not correlate well with coffee bean defects, but anthracnose severity v suggested that coffee quality could be affected by anthracnose. The most effective fungicide for anthracnose control is thiram alone or thiram alternating with propiconazole.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coffee, Colletotrichum biology, species identification, infection process, anthracnose</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179330</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiology of Sitting</field><field name="creator">Andrew Claus</field><field name="description">Background: Clinical ergonomic advice for sitting posture has been inferred from anthropometry theory and physiology studies. Qualitative observation of posture has been used to argue that postures are too flexed, too extended, too static, too mobile, require insufficient muscle activity or require too much. In other fields of healthcare, evidence is progressed from basic science to clinical trials before an intervention is prescribed, but postural advice has been prescribed from basic science without quantitative studies of postural behaviour. Spinal neuromuscular control can predict development of low back pain, it is affected by spinal pain, and can be trained, but studies examining these variables rarely measure the spinal position of their test subjects. There is a need for more detail of how spinal positions affect regional muscle activity. Study Objectives: The overall aims of this thesis were to quantify sagittal spinal postures in sitting for comparison within and between subjects and tasks, and to detail paraspinal and abdominal muscle activity associated with sitting postures. The studies quantified regional spinal curves in - Study I: typical posture behaviour during a computer task in comparison with standing, - Study II: postures that are achievable in sitting, - Study III: the regional muscle activity associated with sitting postures that have been clinically advocated as &#8216;ideal&#8217;, - Study IV: cohorts with and without a history of low back pain for comparison of regional muscle activity. Results and Conclusions: For clinical trials quantifying postural behaviour, the postural variation within subjects and task conditions in Study I demonstrated the importance of measurement over a prolonged period and subjects performing relevant tasks (as opposed to brief measures such as radiography that have been the standard for posture assessment). The use of surface tracking to quantify regional spinal curves and sagittal balance establish a foundation to investigate the effect of interventions on posture behaviour (eg. chair geometry, posture training, task variables and subject cohorts). Study I also showed that typical sitting posture for a computer task was more flexed at the thoracolumbar spinal region than when subjects deliberately &#8216;corrected&#8217; their sitting posture, and both sitting postures were flexed at the lumbar region relative to standing. Study II showed that most subjects were unable to sit with spinal curves like those adopted in standing unless facilitation and feedback were provided, although these curves have been clinically advocated as &#8216;ideal&#8217; posture. If clinical theories about &#8216;ideal&#8217; sitting posture are correct, then teaching individuals the awareness of spinal position or skill to adopt these postures could be as important for workplace health and safety as other variables such as design and adjustment of office furniture. Study III showed three upright sitting postures that have been clinically advocated as &#8216;ideal&#8217; were distinguished by incremental changes in activity of the lumbar multifidus muscles. In Study IV, individuals with a history of low back pain showed more incremental activity at the longissimus thoracis muscle to achieve the same sitting postures. If particular postures are shown to be &#8216;ideal&#8217; in clinical trials, then training for these postures may need to focus on muscular strategies as well as spinal position. The distinct differences in regional muscle activity observed with spinal curves and subject cohorts (Studies III and IV) imply that studies of spinal neuromuscular control should measure or control spinal curves during testing. If spinal posture were controlled, the flat posture (flat surface from ~T5 to sacrum) would have the advantages of being achievable, commonly used in sitting and easily assessed. The flat posture also demonstrated the lowest muscle activity of the upright sitting postures examined, which may improve accuracy of determining muscle activity onset/offset used as an outcome measure for interventions, distinguishing cohorts or as a predictor for low back pain occurrence.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lumbar spine</field><field name="subject">thoracic spine,</field><field name="subject">posture</field><field name="subject">sitting</field><field name="subject">standing</field><field name="subject">measurement</field><field name="subject">sagittal imbalance</field><field name="subject">electromyography</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179355</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pathogenesis of the Metabolic Syndrome: influence of lipid depots and effect of physical activity</field><field name="creator">Lisa-Marie Atkin</field><field name="description">Abstract Metabolic Syndrome (MetSyn) is a medical condition prevalent in Australia. MetSyn is diagnosed with a varying combination of visceral obesity, insulin resistance/ impaired glucose tolerance/ Type 2 diabetes, dyslipidaemia and hypertension. Obesity is a central feature of this syndrome that is characterised by abnormalities in glucose and lipid metabolism. An understanding of the cause of the metabolic derangement that occurs in obesity, and that contributes to MetSyn, would allow effective treatment and prevention strategies to be formulated. This is a priority in the current environment of highly prevalent overweight and obesity in Australian children and adults. Lipotoxicity of insulin-dependent tissues and ectopic fat depots are emerging as fundamental processes in the pathogenesis of MetSyn. Lifestyle intervention, such as increased physical activity, show great promise as agents for disrupting the disease progression and may act via direct or indirect mechanisms on the underlying pathology of MetSyn. This study aimed to determine if diagnostic markers of MetSyn exist in obese, prepubertal, Australian children and to assess the contribution of lifestyle factors on components of MetSyn. Further, this study sought to investigate the relationship between body fat patterning (total body fat, abdominal adipose depots, skeletal intramyocellular lipids, intrahepatocellular lipids) and markers of MetSyn. An experimental intervention was then employed to examine the effect of physical activity on body fat distribution, insulin sensitivity, and haemodynamic and biochemical markers of MetSyn, and additionally to determine if the effect of exercise on parameters of MetSyn was mediated by a change in body fat patterning. Data were collected in a group of 15 obese (mean BMI Z-score 2.51 &#177; 0.49), prepubertal children (6 male, 9 female) aged 5.1 &#8211; 11.4 years (mean age 7.82 yrs &#177; 1.83). Measures included insulin sensitivity, blood biochemistry (lipid, haemostatic and adipocyte activity markers), blood pressure, two-compartment body composition by hydrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance scanning for abdominal adipose depots, intrahepatic lipids and skeletal intramyocellular lipids. Each child&#8217;s habitual nutrition and physical activity were also ascertained using multiple-pass 24-hr diet recalls and accelerometry respectively. Data collection was conducted pre and post a 12-week physical activity intervention which consisted of cardiorespiratory activity during instructor led sessions (60 mins, twice weekly) and family led sessions (&gt;10 mins, 4 days/wk). There is no universally accepted definition of MetSyn in childhood. The International Diabetes Federation suggests that MetSyn should not be diagnosed in children aged 6 to &lt; 10 years. Children can be identified to be at risk of MetSyn, however, based on waist circumference &#8805;90th percentile and family history1,2; all subjects in this study were at risk according to these criteria. Four definitions of paediatric MetSyn previously applied to a group of young, overweight Australian children3 were used to calculate the prevalence of MetSyn in the current sample and it was found to be 27-89% at baseline and 13-80% after the experimental intervention depending upon the definition used. Acanthosis nigricans and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) were present in one female child. Post-intervention, IGT had resolved and the child was glucose tolerant. Habitual dietary intake (energy intake and macronutrients) measured over a 3-day period pre-intervention displayed a significant positive association between fasting glucose and energy intake, as well as a significant negative association between fasting glucose and the protein component of the diet. Following the physical activity programme, energy intake was significantly positively correlated with body fat percentage (% BF). There was no difference found in dietary intake assessed prior to and following cessation of the physical activity intervention, in terms of energy or % energy from macronutrients. Habitual physical activity was not related to MetSyn diagnostic indicators. A higher level of physical fitness, estimated by predicted O2max (ml&#8226;kg-1&#8226;min-1), was significantly correlated with a lower level of diastolic blood pressure at baseline. A greater fitness level ( O2max) was moderately correlated with a lower BMI Z-score following the 12-week intervention. There was no difference between pre- and post-intervention habitual physical activity. A trend towards less sedentary time and increased light intensity activity was found, but these did not reach significance. Physical fitness level showed a trend for improvement following the intervention (P = 0.060). Anthropometrically determined body composition and body fat distribution did not change following the intervention. Radiologically determined abdominal adipose tissue depots were not significantly different post-intervention. % BF was not different when assessed with bioelectrical impedance analysis. However, % BF did reduce significantly over the 12-week intervention period when quantified by hydrometry (42.3% &#177; 5.0 vs 36.9% &#177; 8.6, P = 0.022). Adipokines, the secretory products of adipocytes displaying pleiotropic metabolic action, were investigated for their relation to lipid depots and additionally for change post-intervention. Cardiovascular (CV) disease risk was investigated by proatherogenic and protective blood lipids. When examined at baseline, fasting blood triacylglycerols (TAG) were inversely associated with basal and stimulated insulin sensitivity. Post-intervention, a higher level of HDL-C was found to be associated with greater insulin sensitivity, although this was not apparent at baseline. The relation between TAG and insulin sensitivity discovered pre-intervention was no longer evident. All other biomarkers of CV risk were not associated with body composition, glucose homeostasis, and lifestyle factors pre- and post-intervention. The effect of the physical activity intervention on indicators of haemostasis, physical fitness, blood lipids and lipoproteins, systemic inflammation, and fibrinolytic activity were analysed for change. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly reduced following the physical activity programme. There was no significant difference found in any other measured parameter of CV risk. Log[HOMA], a surrogate index of insulin resistance, was significantly decreased post-intervention indicating reduced insulin resistance. QUICKI, a surrogate index of insulin sensitivity, was significantly improved post-intervention. The remaining indicators of insulin resistance, insulin sensitivity and &#946;-cell function based on fasting surrogates did not significantly change over the 12-week experimental period. Dynamic insulin sensitivity and &#946;-cell function were investigated pre- and post-intervention using paired samples t-tests. Glucose and insulin area under the curve of the OGTT were significantly reduced and whole-body insulin sensitivity index (WBISI) was significantly increased hence showing an improvement in stimulated insulin sensitivity. AUCCP/AUCglu significantly declined also indicating an improved response to oral glucose stimulation. IGI and &#916;CP30/&#916;G30, as markers of &#946;-cell insulin secretion, did not change. Disposition index, the interrelationship of insulin secretion (IGI) and insulin sensitivity (WBISI), was not changed pre- and post-intervention. Hepatic insulin extraction was increased post-intervention (4.3 &#177; 1.2 vs 4.8 &#177; 1.1, P = 0.022) possibly due to greater hepatic and/or peripheral insulin sensitivity. General linear modeling (GLM) showed the improvement in whole-body insulin sensitivity discovered following the intervention was independent of % BF, abdominal adipose tissue depots, and ectopic lipid depots. Intrahepatocellular lipids (IHCL) significantly decreased after the 12-week intervention (6.99% &#177; 9.41 vs 5.83% &#177; 8.54) whilst there was no significant change in the serum markers of liver inflammation. IHCL was positively and strongly associated with total abdominal adipose tissue, intra-abdominal adipose tissue and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue both before and after the intervention. IHCL was positively associated with %BF measured post-intervention; this relationship almost reached significance when measured pre-intervention (P = 0.060). IHCL was not associated with insulin sensitivity either pre- or post-intervention nor with circulating lipids at either timepoint. The change in IHCL was independent of % BF and abdominal adipose tissue tested by GLM. However, there was no significant difference found in IHCL post-intervention after adjustment for insulin sensitivity (WBISI) by GLM. Prior to intervention, 10 of 15 subjects had hepatic steatosis diagnostic of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Eight of the 10 subjects with clinically significant hepatic steatosis had reduction of fatty infiltrate following the exercise intervention. In the whole group it was demonstrated that physical activity attenuates lipid infiltration of the liver independent of body fat. To further investigate the pathophysiology of ectopic lipid depots, biomarkers of oxidative stress and anti-oxidant status were examined in relation to IHCL. Pre-intervention, there was no association found between pro-oxidative or anti-oxidative activity and IHCL. Post-intervention, an inverse association of plasma carotenoid:cholesterol ratio with IHCL was found. Skeletal intramyocellular lipids (IMCL) measured in the right soleus were significantly increased post-intervention (2.4 &#177; 1.1 vs 2.6 &#177; 1.2, P = 0.035). There was no association between IMCL and % BF when measured pre- or post-intervention. Abdominal adipose depots were associated with IMCL at baseline and following the intervention. IMCL was not related to IHCL at either timepoint. Pre-intervention, there was a trend for a relationship between IMCL and insulin. Post-intervention, IMCL was tightly and inversely correlated with insulin sensitivity (r = -0.85 P = 0.000). Linear regression between IMCL and WBISI run pre-intervention and post-intervention found the slopes were not significantly different whereas the intercepts were highly significantly different (P = 0.001), thus, as IMCL increased there was a corresponding decrease in insulin sensitivity. GLM found the increase in IMCL was independent of % BF and abdominal adipose tissue, but was not independent of WBISI. These data indicate the greater IMCL level found post-intervention was a non-pathologic training adaptation. To further investigate the pathophysiology of ectopic lipid depots, biomarkers of oxidative stress and anti-oxidant status were examined in relation to IMCL. Pre-intervention, there was a positive association between malondialdehyde and IMCL. Post-intervention, an inverse association was found between IMCL and both plasma total carotenoids and total carotenoid:free cholesterol ratio. In summation, this study found improved metabolic health in obese, prepubertal children following a 12-week physical activity intervention without dietary intervention or intentional weight loss. Body fat and fat distribution were not prime mediators for the effect of the intervention on parameters of the Metabolic Syndrome; whereas insulin sensitivity was discovered to be a mediator of the change shown in ectopic fat depots. Causality and directionality of these fascinating relationships cannot be determined from the present study, and further research is encouraged. This thesis offers an insight into the pathogenesis of MetSyn and the use of physical activity to improve MetSyn in the setting of paediatric obesity.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">metabolic syndrome</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">obesity</field><field name="subject">physical activity</field><field name="subject">exercise</field><field name="subject">diabetes</field><field name="subject">visceral fat</field><field name="subject">intramyocellular lipid</field><field name="subject">non-alcoholic fatty liver disease</field><field name="subject">hepatic steatosis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179361</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling Variable Viscosity Forced and Free Convection in Porous Media</field><field name="creator">Kamel Hooman</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses modeling transport phenomena in porous media with special attention being paid to convective characteristics of variable viscosity fluids in a homogeneous and isotropic medium. Two different categories of flows, with totally different driving forces, are considered being forced and free convection (both side and bottom heating, for a square enclosure, are studied). To account for property variation, the density is modeled by an Oberbeck&#8211;Boussinesq approximation while the viscosity is modeled by an exponential function. The limitations of the previous work, addressing the issue, are discussed in detail and improvements, in terms of thermo-hydraulic performance of the system are suggested. Dealing with the global aspects of the problem, the two major methods being the reference temperature and the property ratio approach are implemented. For natural convection problems, the former method is used; while for forced convection the latter is undertaken. New correlations, which are proved to be more accurate, are proposed for both forced and free convection problems. Besides, closed form solutions are reported for some cases of constant and variable viscosity. Convection visualization is also studied in detail where the concept of Energy Flux Vectors is put forward along with the application of heatlines and energy streamlines. It was mathematically shown that in two-dimensional space heatlines and energy streamlines, which were invented independently, are the same as each other. Moreover, the newly developed concept, energy flux vectors serve as a new tool for convection visualization with the main advantage that this new technique, unlike heatlines and energy streamlines, does not require further (and sometimes complicated) numerical analysis in addition to solving momentum and thermal energy equations. This, in its turn, reduces the time and computer resources required to see the flow of energy. Finally, in Chapter 7, the summary of the work along with the conclusions are presented. Finally, recommendations for future studies are put forward.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">porous media</field><field name="subject">variable property</field><field name="subject">free convection</field><field name="subject">forced convection</field><field name="subject">numerical</field><field name="subject">analytical</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179544</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Third-Party Disability in Spouses of Older People with Hearing Impairment</field><field name="creator">Nerina Scarinci</field><field name="description">Hearing impairment is the most common communication disability in older people. The wide-ranging impact of hearing impairment on communication means that not only does the person with hearing impairment experience the consequences but also his or her frequent communication partners. This thesis investigates the impact of hearing impairment on spouses and uses the World Health Organization&#8217;s term &#8220;third-party disability.&#8221; Third-party disability is defined as the impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions experienced by the family due to the health condition of their significant other, and was identified by the World Health Organization as an area for future development and application of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). Despite a number of studies previously published on the effect of hearing impairment on family members, including younger couples and carers, there remain substantial gaps in knowledge and understanding of the difficulties specifically relating to older people and factors associated with third-party hearing disability. This thesis focuses on the third-party disability experienced by normally hearing spouses (termed the &#8220;spouses&#8221; in this thesis) of older people with hearing impairment (termed the &#8220;partners&#8221; in this thesis). To add empirical data to the body of research, this series of studies first explored the lived experience of spouses of older people with hearing impairment in a qualitative study, then identified the ICF domains and categories that described third-party hearing disability, described the extent of third-party hearing disability in this population, modelled the contribution of factors to third-party hearing disability, and developed and psychometrically tested a scale to measure the third-party disability of spouses of older people with hearing impairment. Studies conducted within this thesis were therefore completed in two phases. Ten spouses of older people with hearing impairment participated in the first qualitative phase, consisting of semi-structured in-depth interviews. Results of this study showed that spouses experience a number of effects as a result of their partners&#8217; hearing impairment including: (1) the broad ranging effects of the hearing impairment on the spouses&#8217; everyday lives; (2) the spouses&#8217; need to constantly adapt to their partners&#8217; hearing impairment; (3) the effect of acceptance of the hearing impairment on the spouse; and (4) the impact of ageing and retirement. Findings were then linked to the ICF to identify the most typical and relevant domains and categories of the ICF for spouses of older people with hearing impairment. The majority of themes were able to be linked to the ICF, with most linking to codes in the activities and participation component. A number of contextual factors were also identified that influenced the spouses&#8217; third-party disability. In the second phase, a further 100 older couples affected by hearing impairment participated in a quantitative face-to-face survey to describe the nature and degree of third-party disability in spouses, and to examine factors associated with third-party hearing disability. Concepts identified in the first qualitative study were used to formulate a 36-item tool for measuring spouses&#8217; third-party hearing disability, namely the Significant Other Scale for Hearing Disability (SOS-HEAR). The majority of spouses in this study (98%) reported some degree of third-party hearing disability on at least one item of the SOS-HEAR. Communication difficulties between the couple were the central source of stress reported by spouses, followed by emotional problems in the spouse. Three factors were found to be significantly associated with greater third-party hearing disability: (1) lower relationship satisfaction as described by spouses; (2) a larger spouse-partner age difference; and (3) greater hearing disability in the hearing impaired partner as perceived by the spouse. The scaling properties of the SOS-HEAR were then examined, with a revised 27-item questionnaire found to be a reliable means of measuring older spouses&#8217; third-party hearing disability. Use of the SOS-HEAR is proposed as a means of identifying spouses of older people with hearing impairment in need of intervention. If spouses are identified as experiencing third-party hearing disability, health professionals are then in a position to facilitate discussions with the couple about the impact of the hearing loss on their daily functioning. The inclusion of spouses in rehabilitation takes into account the needs of both members of the couple such that they become partners in rehabilitation. In summary, this research has shown that hearing impairment in older people has an effect on the spouse, as they too experience situations of communication activity limitations and participation restrictions. It is clear that the lives of participants in this study were considerably affected as a result of their partners&#8217; hearing impairment, with spouses reporting a wide variety of stresses involving lifestyle changes, communication difficulties, and emotional consequences. This series of studies has highlighted the potentially important role of family-centred intervention in rehabilitation for older adults with hearing impairment, and strongly suggests the need for increased inclusion of spouses and significant others in the rehabilitation process.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">third-party disability</field><field name="subject">hearing impairment</field><field name="subject">ICF</field><field name="subject">older people</field><field name="subject">ageing</field><field name="subject">spouses</field><field name="subject">significant others</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">psychosocial factors</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179594</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Addiction Neuroethics: The Promises and Perils of Neuroscience Research on Addiction</field><field name="creator">Adrian Carter</field><field name="description">Drug addiction is a significant problem facing most societies. It is associated with increased violence, crime and mental illness, and is one of the leading causes of preventable mortality and disability in most developed societies, accounting for over 12% of the total burden of disease (Begg et al., 2007). Neuroscience promises to significantly reduce the incidence and severity of addictive drug use, and the harm that it causes, by providing more effective and better targeted treatment of addiction (Volkow and Li, 2005). Proponents argue that an increased understanding of the neurobiological basis of drug addiction will also lend support for more humane social policies. These policies will recognise that addiction is a neuropsychiatric condition that should be treated therapeutically, leading to increased investment in addiction research and treatment (Dackis and O'Brien, 2005; McLellan et al., 2000). Optimism about the benefits of an understanding of the neurobiological basis of addiction needs to be tempered by more critical considerations. Overly simplistic interpretations of what this kind of approach reveals about addiction could result in less welcome consequences, especially if inappropriate use is made of emerging neurotechnologies, such as coerced use of naltrexone implants, population-wide vaccination programs against addiction, or the promotion of heroic &#8216;cures&#8217; for addiction, such as neurosurgery and deep brain stimulation. This thesis examines both the potentially welcome and unwelcome uses of neurobiological research of addiction with the aims of maximising the benefits, while minimizing any unanticipated harms. I refer to this as Addiction Neuroethics. The primary aims are to examine: (1) the impact that neuroscience research may have upon our understanding of autonomy and self-control in addicted individuals, (2) the implications this understanding may have for how we treat individuals with an addiction; and (3) the conditions under which it would be ethically acceptable to use various technologies emerging from this research. This thesis falls into three parts. First, a concise and accessible summary of the key findings of recent genetic and neuroscience research of addiction is provided. This includes the neuroanatomy of addiction (e.g. the mesolimbic reward pathway), the molecular and cellular biology of addiction, neurocognitive changes, and the role of genetic and environmental vulnerabilities. The second part of this thesis explores how neuroscience research may influence the way that modern societies think about drug use and addiction, and deal with those that suffer from it. This section addresses the central question: do addicted persons have the capacity to make autonomous decisions regarding their own drug use? This raises a number of additional questions. How much responsibility and blame should we attribute to addicted individual&#8217;s for their actions? How should society deal with addicted persons, or respond to the harm that they cause? Should society coerce addicted individuals into treatment, and if so, under what conditions? The third part of this thesis examines the ethical issues raised by the use of powerful new technologies that are emerging from neurobiological research on addiction, such as novel psychopharmacologies, depot implants, drug vaccines, neurosurgery and brain stimulation, neuroimaging and genetic testing. The report also considers the more speculative possibility that addiction neurobiology may improve our ability to prevent the development of addiction, for example, by using genetic screening to identify individuals at high risk of addiction and &#8216;drug vaccines&#8217; to prevent these individuals from becoming addicted. This thesis demonstrates that the chronic use of addictive drugs has significant impacts upon key decision-making regions of the brain (e.g. motivation, memory, impulse inhibition) that affect addicted individuals ability to choose not to use drugs. While the autonomy of addicted individuals is impaired in certain situations, and to varying degrees, it is not extinguished. Rather than deny autonomy, we should aim to engage addicted individuals in ways that increase their autonomy. For example, coerced treatment of addiction may be a valid approach to getting addicted individuals in treatment. However we should avoid overriding the autonomy of addicted individuals by offering treatment as an alternative to punishment for some crimes (e.g. theft to fund drug habit). Such treatment should aim to treat a medical condition, and not be a form of extrajudicial punishment. Addiction is a highly stigmatised condition. This can significantly impact upon the way in which neuroscience research is understood and applied. Scientists, clinicians and policy makers must be mindful of over-enthusiastic applications of novel technologies that may be prematurely embraced and promoted to a desperate and vulnerable population without proper evaluation of the risks, or without considering how these technologies may be used once approved. The treatment of addiction should be judged by its efficacy and safety, as for any other medical treatment. Addicted individuals should be treated as any other individual suffering from a medical condition. The thesis concludes with some general suggestions about the directions in which this debate is likely to develop and identifies areas that will require further analysis and empirical investigation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">addiction</field><field name="subject">neuroethics</field><field name="subject">autonomy</field><field name="subject">consent</field><field name="subject">coercion</field><field name="subject">rights</field><field name="subject">neuroscience</field><field name="subject">treatment</field><field name="subject">prevention</field><field name="subject">policy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179596</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hemispheric contributions to language: A divided visual field investigation of semantic processing following unilateral lesions</field><field name="creator">Erin Smith</field><field name="description">The left hemisphere (LH) is accepted as the dominant hemisphere for language processing. There is also evidence confirming the language processing abilities of the right hemisphere (RH), particularly its lexical-semantic processing potential (Chiarello, 1988; Joanette, Goulet, &amp; Hannequin, 1990). The capacity of the RH for language processing is significant to the investigation of language processing following LH lesions. However, the precise neurocognitive mechanisms underlying language processing following lesion remain to be fully elucidated. Subsequently, the overall aim for this thesis is to investigate hemispheric contributions to semantic processing following unilateral lesions, and to explore the significance of the contribution made by the RH. In order to achieve this overall aim, the current thesis firstly explores the hemispheric contributions made to lexical-semantic processing for healthy adults, and then shifts focus to explore the changes in hemispheric processing for participants with unilateral lesions (LH and RH). Comparisons of hemispheric activation between these groups will clarify the underlying hemispheric mechanisms that facilitate language processing following unilateral lesion. This thesis includes four complementary investigations of hemispheric contributions to semantic processing. The first study combined divided visual field (DVF) priming with event-related potentials (ERPs), in order to investigate controlled hemispheric semantic priming for young healthy adults. Two experiments were employed for a between subjects comparison of time-course differences (stimulus onset asynchrony, or SOA, varied between experiments) in hemispheric activation of associated and nonassociated category members. Continuous electroencephalograms were recorded throughout the priming task for each participant, and later analysed with reference to relevant ERP components (N400 and Late Positive Complex). Bilateral N400 priming was revealed for associated category members at both the short and long SOA. There was no significant N400 priming for the nonassociated category member condition. The examination of hemispheric priming of associated and nonassociated category member stimuli over the same time-course was continued in the second study for participants with unilateral LH lesions and matched controls. The second investigation aimed to determine the impact of unilateral LH lesions on controlled hemispheric semantic priming, utilising the DVF priming paradigm with participants following unilateral lesions. This study also aimed to explore associations between hemispheric activation during the online priming task and offline comprehension abilities. Differences in priming were observed between the LH lesion group and the control group, with participants in the LH lesion group requiring the association relationship to elicit priming. Priming also varied for participants as a function of their offline comprehension abilities, with RH priming associated with higher offline scores. The third investigation continued the exploration of hemispheric semantic activation following LH lesion, examining the impact of a LH lesion on interhemispheric control mechanisms, and the modification of hemispheric processing capacities with and without dominant hemisphere control. This investigation again utilised DVF priming with associated and nonassociated category member stimuli, in conjunction with the dual task paradigm. The dual task paradigm is designed to overload one hemisphere&#8217;s processing resources in order to remove interhemispheric suppression. Findings indicate that following LH lesions, the RH&#8217;s contribution is enhanced under conditions that are designed to overload the LH. The final study shifts from the investigation of participants with LH lesions to the impact of a RH lesion. This exploration of controlled hemispheric semantic priming following RH lesion sought to increase our understanding of the underlying mechanisms for semantic processing following unilateral lesion. The RH&#8217;s role in lexical-semantic processing has been documented consistently over approximately the last twenty years, however, there remains limited direct investigation of a RH lesion&#8217;s impact on contributions to semantic processing. A single case investigation utilised the same experimental procedure as the second study described. Findings suggest a similar activation pattern between the individual with RH lesion and the control participants, with both exhibiting bilateral activation of the associated and nonassociated category member stimuli. However, a subtle difference was found between the activation of the individual with RH lesion and that of the control group, with the individual with a RH lesion showing increased strategic processing difficulties at the longer SOA. Overall, the current thesis demonstrates the importance of the RH for efficient strategic semantic processing for both healthy adults, and people with unilateral lesions. In addition, this thesis concludes that following a LH lesion, the RH contribution to controlled semantic processing may be associated with successful comprehension, and that RH contributions may be improved with the addition of a secondary task designed to overload LH processing. The present thesis provides evidence to support the use of the DVF priming paradigm in the investigation of hemispheric contributions to semantic processing following unilateral lesion. It is anticipated that these findings will improve the current understanding of the underlying hemispheric contributions to lexical-semantics following a unilateral lesion, and will encourage continuing investigation into the RH&#8217;s capacity to impact language recovery.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hemispheric Contributions</field><field name="subject">Semantics</field><field name="subject">Semantic Priming</field><field name="subject">Association</field><field name="subject">Category Membership</field><field name="subject">Controlled Processing</field><field name="subject">Left Hemisphere Lesion</field><field name="subject">Right Hemisphere Lesion</field><field name="subject">Divided Visual Field</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179598</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Entomological investigation of the risk of establishment of West Nile virus in eastern Australia</field><field name="creator">Cassie Jansen</field><field name="description">Since the establishment of West Nile virus (WNV) in North America, concern has arisen that this virus may also pose a biosecurity threat to Australia. West Nile virus is maintained in an enzootic transmission cycle between birds and ornithophilic Culex spp. mosquitoes. Since its introduction into the United States in 1999, it has been responsible for over 11,000 human cases of neurological disease and over 1,000 human deaths. In addition, WNV has caused extensive equine and avian mortality. Should an exotic, virulent strain of WNV be introduced into Australia, it may have significant impact on human and animal health. This thesis examines entomological factors which may influence the potential for an exotic, pathogenic strain of WNV to become established in eastern Australia and be maintained in urban transmission cycles. Further, it aims to elucidate the most likely candidate vectors for the maintenance of WNV in natural transmission cycles. Components include: a) laboratory-based vector competence experiments to assess the ability of Australian mosquito species to become infected with and transmit a North American strain of WNV; b) identification of the vertebrate origin of mosquito bloodmeals using serological and molecular assays; c) an evaluation of the efficacy of bird-baited traps for collecting ornithophilic mosquitoes at ground level and in the tree canopy; and d) examination of the prevalence of endemic arboviruses, including Kunjin virus (KUNV; an Australian subtype of WNV) in mosquitoes collected from urban centres of eastern Australia. Vector competence experiments were conducted with field-collected Australian mosquito species. Nineteen species were were exposed to a 1999 New York strain of WNV using an artificial membrane feeding apparatus and transmission was attempted using an in vitro modified capillary tube method. A number of Culex species, including Culex quinquefasciatus and Culex gelidus, demonstrated high vector competence for WNV. Culex annulirostris, the primary KUNV vector, was the most competent vector, displaying transmission rates of &#61603;84%. Other common species, including Aedes vigilax, Aedes procax and Verrallina spp. were less susceptible to infection. Approximately 1,200 blood engorged mosquitoes were analysed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to determine host species. Overall, 90% of bloodmeals from Cx. quinquefasciatus were avian in origin, while 22% of bloodmeals from Cx. annulirostris were from birds. Molecular assays were further used to determine which bird species were commonly targeted by a selection of ornithophilic mosquito species. Mitochondrial DNA sequence data indicated that most (93%) avian bloodmeals from Cx. quinquefasciatus were obtained from passerine birds (order Passeriformes). Avian species commonly targeted by Cx. quinquefasciatus included Sphecotheres vieilloti (Australasian figbird; 39% of total identified), Sturnus tristis (common myna; 19%) and Philemon buceroides (helmeted friarbird; 17%). Alternatively, the majority (87%) of avian bloodmeals identified from Cx. annulirostris were from non-passerine birds, with most bloodmeals obtained from ducks (72%; family Anatidae). Seven field-based Latin Square trials conducted in Brisbane and Cairns showed that conventional CO2-baited CDC traps yielded higher numbers of Culex spp. than novel bird-baited traps, both at ground level and in the tree canopy. In Brisbane, CO2-baited CDC traps placed at ground level (approximately 1 m from ground) collected significantly more Cx. annulirostris than those at canopy height (5-10 m) during two trials, and more Ae. vigilax and Aedes procax during one trial each. Conversely, in Cairns, CO2-baited CDC traps placed in the tree canopy collected significantly more Culex squamosus during two trials, and significantly more Aedeomyia catasticta and Culex cubiculi during one trial each. Consistently low yields of ornithophilic species including Culex australicus and Cx. quinquefasciatus in all traps tested suggests the need to employ alternative trapping measures to target these species in urban areas. Over 1,800 mosquito pools (comprising over 65,000 individual mosquitoes collected from urban environments) were tested for evidence of arboviral infection. None of the pools showed evidence of flavivirus infection, but two alphaviruses were isolated from mosquito pools from Cairns. One isolate of Barmah Forest virus was obtained from a pool of 100 Ae. vigilax, and a pool of 89 Verrallina carmenti yielded an isolate of Ross River virus. In addition, an isolate most similar to a newly described bunyavirus, Stretch Lagoon orbivirus, was obtained from a single Aedes alternans collected from Sydney. The outcomes of this thesis demonstrate that a number of Australian mosquito species can become infected with and transmit a virulent strain of WNV, should it be introduced into Australia. Analysis of the host feeding patterns of these potential vectors in urban environments demonstrates that a number of candidate vectors, including Cx. quinquefasciatus and Cx. annulirostris, readily feed on common bird species. Further, the absence of detectable flavivirus infection in urban mosquito populations shown here suggests that endemic urban flaviviruses would have minimal influence on potential WNV transmission. Notwithstanding other ecological factors that may influence the likelihood of enzootic or epizootic transmission including susceptibility of vertebrate hosts and mechanisms of introduction, the potential establishment of an exotic, virulent strain of WNV in urban areas of Australia is certainly possible given the evidence provided in this thesis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">West Nile virus, Culicidae, vector, Australia, Culex, host feeding, vector competence, virus detection</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179600</field></doc><doc><field name="title">HEADACHE IN THE ELDERLY: CERVICAL MUSCULOSKELETAL, SENSORY AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FEATURES</field><field name="creator">Sureeporn Uthaikhup</field><field name="description">Background: Headache is common in the elderly. Cervical degenerative changes are universal with ageing and cervicogenic headache is proposed (albeit without evidence) as a frequent cause of headache in this age group. Previous research identified a pattern of cervical musculoskeletal impairment which differentiated cervicogenic headache from other frequent headaches but this study was undertaken on younger/middle aged individuals. The value of this diagnostic pattern could be questioned for an older population with concomitant age related changes in the musculoskeletal system. The first and foremost aim of this research was to determine if cervical musculoskeletal impairment was specific to headaches classifiable as cervicogenic or was more generic to headache in elders. Participants with headache were sub-grouped on the basis of the pattern of cervical musculoskeletal impairment and the relationship between this grouping and headache classification was investigated. The presence of sensory hypersensitivity and psychological distress are features of headache that can provide information on the underlying mechanisms and provide management directives for headache. There is little knowledge of whether or not these features are influenced by a factor of age. Thus the second and third aims of this research were to investigate sensory features and psychological and quality of life features in the elderly with headache. Methods: One hundred and eighteen subjects, aged 60 to 75 years with recurrent headache and 44 controls were studied. Ninety-three reported a single headache and 25, two or more headache types. All subjects completed the Neck Disability Index (NDI), Geriatric Depression Scale-short form (GDS-S) and SF-36 questionnaires. Subjects with headache also completed a headache questionnaire and the Survey of Pain Attitudes (SOPA-35). Neck function measures included range of motion, manual examination of cervical segments, cranio-cervical flexor muscle function, joint position sense, cervical muscle strength, cross-sectional area of selected cervical extensors and posture. Sensory measures included pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) and thermal pain thresholds (TPTs). PPTs were measured over the forehead, upper neck and at a remote site (tibialis anterior). TPTs were measured over the upper neck. Results: Cluster analysis, based on the three musculoskeletal variables aligned previously with cervicogenic headache, divided headache subjects into two groups; cluster 1 (n = 57), cluster 2 (n = 50). There was significantly reduced cervical extension, axial rotation, rotation in neck flexion and lateral flexion in the headache clusters than the control group, and in the frequency of symptomatic joint dysfunction (C0-1 &#8211; C7-T1) (all p &lt; 0.05). Subjects in cluster 1 had significantly reduced range of cervical extension and axial rotation and frequency of symptomatic joint dysfunction (C1-2 and C7-T1) compared to those in cluster 2 and controls (all p &lt; 0.05). More subjects in cluster 1 had headaches &#8805; 15 days per month and histories of head/neck trauma (both p &lt; 0.05). Most cervicogenic headaches were grouped in cluster 1, but musculoskeletal dysfunction was also found in headaches classifiable as migraine or tension-type headache. The analysis of subjects with single headaches revealed no significant differences between the headache groups (migraine, tension-type, cervicogenic and unclassifiable headaches) and controls in pressure and cold pain thresholds (all p &gt; 0.05). Heat pain thresholds were significantly lower in the headache groups compared to controls (all p &lt; 0.01) but there were no differences between headache types (all p &gt; 0.05). There were no strong relationships between any headache variable and pain thresholds. Elders with headache scored lower on most SF-36 domains, higher on the GDS-S (p &lt; 0.05) and comparably on the SOPA-35 (p &gt; 0.05) compared to the control group. The GDS score was below the threshold value for depression. Differences in these measures were not dependent on the headache types but rather, headache frequency. Subjects with headaches &#8805; 15 days/month scored lowest on SF-36 domains and highest on GDS-S questionnaire compared to those with headache &lt; 15 days/month and controls (all p &lt; 0.05). The mean NDI score in the subjects with headache indicated the presence of mild to moderate neck pain and disability. No strong relationships were found between well-being and headache frequency, intensity and length of headache history. The NDI score had the greatest influence on physical well-being and GDS-S score on mental well-being (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Several aspects of cervical musculoskeletal function, heat thresholds, general well being and quality of life were altered in elders with headache. Neck dysfunction was not uniquely confined to cervicogenic headache but was a generic feature of headache in the elderly. No generalized changes in pain sensitivity were present in elders with headache. Headache had a significant impact on elders&#8217; quality of life but was not associated with depression. Neck pain was an important factor influencing function and well-being. Conservative management such as physiotherapy may be a safe and appropriate option for elders with headache, given its frequent association with cervical musculoskeletal impairment. Further research is required for a better understanding of the neck&#8217;s role in elders&#8217; headache.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">headache</field><field name="subject">elderly</field><field name="subject">neck pain</field><field name="subject">cervical musculoskeletal impairment</field><field name="subject">pain thresholds</field><field name="subject">depressive symptom</field><field name="subject">quality of life</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179601</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Somatic embryogenesis for micropropagation of coconut (Cocos nucifera L.)</field><field name="creator">Irina Antonova</field><field name="description">Coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) is native to the regions between 20oN and 20oS of the Equator, where it plays a significant socioeconomic role in the local communities. There it is referred to as &#8217;The Tree of Life&#8217;, a eulogistic epithet describing its versatile use - more than 100 edible and non-edible products can be produced from it. Therefore the coconut palm is grown in about 90 tropical countries on more than 10 millions ha of land (Hamon et al., 1999). Although coconut has a high local socioeconomic reputation, its production is experiencing many problems and consequently the area planted with this crop is declining. The conventional breeding approach using seed to replant land is very expensive due to the low production of seed for planting, and even when elite germplasm is available it takes decades to multiply up enough planting material for new areas (Adkins et al., 1999). Hence over the past 40 years research has been directed towards developing a new technique for the micropropagation of coconut using somatic embryogenic approach. Throughout this time however one conclusion is repeatedly made &#8211; coconut is very recalcitrant to somatic embryogenesis. And although the many obstacles to this are slowly being reduced, in order to successfully micropropagate coconut on a large scale bottlenecks in the protocol still exist, and those include inconsistency of the embryogenic response by explanted tissues, poor somatic embryo maturation and germination, low regeneration rate of the new plantlets and long time required to produce plants (1.5 years) (Samosir et al., 1998). These bottlenecks and other problems were researched in the present study with the aim of trying to speed up the efficiency of coconut somatic embryogenesis process. Hence this thesis had the objectives to identify a starting protocol for coconut somatic embryogenesis; to select an appropriate for aim that explant; to optimize the production of embryogenic callus; to increase the rate of initiating coconut somatic embryos; to improve the maturation of somatic embryos and their germination efficiency; and to optimize the regeneration rate of the new plantlets. In order to identify a starting protocol, preliminary work was conducted, where existing protocols for coconut somatic embryogenesis were compared in their efficiency to induce somatic embryos. The protocol that stood out as the best in producing most embryogenic callus and subsequently embryos, as well as having the least dead (in culture) explants, was that of Nikmatullah (2001). Therefore the latter was chosen to be used as a starting protocol for this study. New sources of explants were investigated during the current work as well, using tissues from different parts of in vitro derived 8 months old coconut plantlets. Those however have shown to be unsuitable for somatic embryogenesis, since only non-embryogenic callus was developed by some of the inoculated tissues. The immature inflorescence explants were superior in producing embryogenic callus and somatic embryos; therefore they were selected as the preferred explant source to use in the next steps of the current study. Optimizing the production of embryogenic callus was the first issue to address during the core work of this project. As a result of that the culture conditions were considerably improved by using vessels with larger headspace-medium ratio (3:1), as well as by selecting younger immature inflorescences and transversely segmenting the top half of the inflorescence spikes into smaller size (1 mm) sections. Further improvement was possible by studying the make up of the callus growth media. Amongst the administered for that purpose substances the applied together polyamines spermine (0.10 &#181;M) and putrescine (7.5 mM) have proven to play a notably positive role in the induction of callus from coconut immature inflorescence explants. Thidiazuron (TDZ, 10 &#181;M) too has shown a potential to improve the efficiency of the initial stage of coconut somatic embryogenesis, but only when applied in conjunction with other cytokinins (eg. BAP and 2iP). Smoke-saturated-water (SSW, 10 %) could only slightly diminish the amount of necrotising cultured explants, and high 2,4-D concentrations could not support the induction of callus from immature coconut inflorescences. Collectively taken, as a result of this current study the production of callus was improved by 300 %. The rate of coconut somatic embryos formation was as well significantly increased (over 300 %), by the simultaneous application of suspension culture step, spermine (0.01 &#181;M), SSW (10 %) and high auxin concentration (500 &#181;M). Nevertheless the presence of TDZ and other cytokinins in the medium, as well as the absence of activated charcoal, were found to be unable to positively influence the somatic embryogenesis process. Despite the considerable improvements made in the efficiency of inducing callus and initiating embryos, the poor maturation and germination (eg. 5 %, Verdeil et. al., 1999) of somatic embryos still remained a bottleneck to the whole somatic embryogenesis procedure. Therefore further work was conducted in that direction and discovered that embryo maturation and germination rate can be elevated to 55 % by administering ancymidol (30 &#181;M) to the somatic embryo maturation medium. This plant retardant has exhibited here three potential modes of action towards the cultured coconut somatic embryos: a) as a promoter of somatic embryo maturation and germination; b) as a preventor of pre-germination death of the somatic embryos; and c) as a preserver of non-germinating somatic embryos, that still can possess the potential to germinate in the future. The work during the next step of the process &#8211; regeneration of the new plantlets &#8211; has shown that the omission of plant growth regulators from the media was crucial for the development of germinated embryos into new plantlets, where otherwise no plant regeneration occurred at all. The achieved here plantlet regeneration rate in the PGR-free medim was 56 %, which is higher than the previously reported 20 % regeneration rate (Verdeil et al., 1994) for coconut plantlets produced from immature inflorescences explants. As a result of this current work a new method was developed for somatic embryogenesis of coconut from immature inflorescences explants (Fig. 9.2). The overall efficiency of this protocol is over three times higher than that of the starting protocol (Nikmatullah, 2001) selected during the preliminary work. Furthermore, when using this new method the entire duration for regenerating clonal coconut plantlets (up to the stage of first root and shoot emerging) takes up to 8 months, which is the shortest reported time for producing coconut plantlets via somatic embryogenesis (eg. 36 months from inflorescences explants (Verdeil et. al., 1999) and 18 months from sliced zygotic explants (Samosir, 1999, Fig. 9.2), presenting an additional valuable advantage of this newly developed method, from the perspective of the potential to micropropagate coconut on a commercial scale.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">coconut, somatic embryogenesis, micropropagation, polyamines, spermine, putrescine, ancymidol, smoke-saturated-water, thidiazuron</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179602</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recognition Event-Related Potentials and Neuropsychological Indices in Healthy Ageing and Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment</field><field name="creator">Megan Broughton</field><field name="description">Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) has been established as a significant risk factor for Alzheimer&#8223;s disease (AD) and in many cases this state appears to represent an early or incipient stage of AD. Due to difficulties with the diagnosis and prognosis of aMCI and AD, as well as with the projected significant socioeconomic ramifications of AD, there is a need to establish sensitive and reliable biomarkers. The application of event related potentials (ERPs) has been recommended in this context due to their reliability, non-invasive nature, inexpense and relatively widespread availability. This thesis aims to further assess the potential efficacy of ERP markers for such applications. These aims are pursued via investigations of ERPs in healthy ageing, MCI and AD utilising an explicit recognition task that requires the use of key cognitive/memory processes which are often impaired in aMCI and AD. Two ERP effects were analysed: the N400effect which is assumed to index familiarity or trace strength, and the Late Positive Complex (LPC) which appears to index recollection or decision-related factors such as accuracy. Chapter 3 reports ERP and recognition accuracy comparisons between samples of 15 young (mean age = 21.73 years) and 15 older, cognitively healthy adults (mean age = 66.67 years). ERP data were acquired during performance of a word recognition task with high and low memory load conditions (long and short encoding lists, respectively). At test, participants were required to make old/new judgements to visually presented words. There was a trend for young participants to perform more accurately than the older sample, especially on the long list; although these differences only approached significance. However, the N400 old/new effect was found to be significantly reduced in the old compared with the young participants across memory load conditions. LPC old/new effects were generally not observed and this is likely due to the nature of the task which generally places minimal demands on controlled retrieval processes. These results indicate that the N400 effect may be more sensitive to the deleterious effects of ageing on recognition memory-related process(s) than behavioural measures of memory accuracy. Consistent with the view that the N400 indexes familiarity, these results are in accordance with other evidence that familiarity is affected in healthy ageing. The same methodology was used to compare ERPs between aMCI (n = 11) and healthy older adults (n = 11) in Chapter 4. The aMCI participants performed significantly worse than vi healthy elderly participants in discriminating &#8222;old&#8223; from &#8222;new&#8223; words. In the corresponding ERP data, healthy control sample demonstrated significant N400 old/new effects at parietal electrode locations, whereas aMCI participants failed to demonstrate significant N400 old/new effects at any electrode location. Again, LPC effects were not observed in either sample. The absence of significant N400 effects in aMCI participants may reflect a disruption of familiarity-based recognition in aMCI. These results converge with other evidence that the N400 effect may be a sensitive ERP marker useful for detecting, monitoring and/or predicting amnestic related cognitive decline. There are reported variations in underlying causes and sequelae of aMCI (e.g., not all progress to AD). Chapter 5 reports an exploratory investigation aimed at determining whether baseline ERPs differentiate between aMCI participants on the basis of their clinical diagnosis at follow-up. Baseline ERP data were compared in a small sample (n = 7) of aMCI participant who remained cognitively stable at 12-month follow-up (SMCI) with two aMCI participants who progressed to meet an AD diagnosis (PMCI) at the latter time-point. There was a trend for PMCI participants to display smaller old/new effects. However, only one participant displayed significantly smaller N400 old/new effects under low memory load conditions. Interestingly, this participant was also more impaired in baseline cognitive functioning. Chapter 6 examines the relationship between baseline ERPs and performance on neuropsychological assessment at 12-month follow-up in a sample of aMCI and AD participants (n =13) in order to investigate whether ERPs may prove informative for prognoses regarding general trajectories of cognitive decline, irrespective of diagnostic status. Smaller N400 old/new effects (at Fz and CPz) were associated with poorer performance on tasks assessing global cognitive functioning and auditory attention span. Reduced LPC old/new differences were related to poorer performance on tasks assessing global cognitive functioning, verbal learning and memory and better performance on a task assessing working memory at follow-up. In contrast to these results, no relationships were observed between ERP effects and concurrent performance on neuropsychological assessment in this sample, or in 42 elderly participants (including healthy, aMCI and AD), as described in Chapter 7. Taken together these results suggest that ERPs may be more sensitive in predicting future rather than concurrent cognitive functioning and may provide a more objective measure/classification of cognitive impairment vii irrespective of diagnosis. These outcomes are particularly novel as the relationship between baseline ERP data and follow-up neuropsychological measures does not appear to have been systematically reported in the literature to date. Collectively these findings indicate that ERP measure(s), particularly the N400 old/new effect, are sensitive to neurocognitive changes associated with ageing and aMCI, and may prove a useful biomarker for the early detection of AD. This is interesting as the effects of healthy ageing and pathological decline on the N400 from explicit recognition tasks have not been thoroughly explored. Moreover, the N400 (and perhaps, to a lesser degree, LPC) effect(s) appear to have substantial value for informing future prognoses of subsequent cognitive trajectories, at least for persons with amnestic impairment. These results may have significant clinical implications pertaining to the selection and application of efficacious therapeutic interventions in aMCI and AD.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Event-related Potentials</field><field name="subject">N400</field><field name="subject">Lpc</field><field name="subject">ageing</field><field name="subject">Alzheimer's Disease</field><field name="subject">Mild Cognitive Impairment</field><field name="subject">Recognition memory</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179641</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EXPLORING NOVEL BIOACTIVE BONE REPAIR STRATEGIES</field><field name="creator">Arjuna Kumarasuriyar</field><field name="description">Alternative bone repair strategies are frequently sought after in orthopaedic surgery to address the growing need for improved morbidity and healing rates. This thesis sought to initiate and validate such an alternative, harnessing the flexible nature of a biomaterial substrate and the unique potential of glycosaminoglycan sugars. A novel, biodegradable biomaterial polymer, PHBV, has previously been identified to have the potential to mimic the characteristics of bone necessary for tissue repair and in this study, it was hypothesized that PHBV would be able to support bone formation. When tested in vitro, PHBV was found to support osteoblast cell attachment, proliferation and differentiation, despite its rougher, more hydrophobic surface characteristics compared to tissue culture plastic (TCP). However, unlike the progression of cells on TCP, PHBV caused a developmental delay at each stage of osteogenesis, suggesting a sub-optimal cell-substrate interaction. The expression profiles of genes involved in the maintenance of the extracellular matrix were monitored to investigate this phenomenon further. The results suggested that cells cultured on PHBV appeared to preference 7 against a collagen-based ECM and, instead, trigger an increase in the expression of other factors, such as osteopontin, presumably to modify the biomaterial microenvironment to optimise continued growth and differentiation. This finding led to the next hypothesis that functionalisation of PHBV with suitable compounds could optimise and enhance the osteogenic development at the implant site by facilitating the desired and appropriate cell-substrate interactions. Non-protein factors are often preferred for functionalisation to material scaffolds over proteins, as they are relatively robust and can survive many of the processes used in the manufacture of biomaterials. Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) sugars were appropriate candidates for this purpose, as they are not only abundantly expressed in bone, but more importantly, they are capable of binding and facilitating the activity of growth factors. Furthermore, they are resistant to several environmental influences including changes in pH, heat and desiccation. To identify a GAG that could be integrated with PHBV or any other biomaterial substrate, GAGs were extracted from phenotypically-distinct stages of MG-63 osteosarcoma cells. These GAGs were identified to display gross structural differences, as well as differences in the enzymes synthesising them, between immature and mature osteoblastic cells, with the increased production of a larger GAG species observed as the cells differentiated. Unexpectedly, however, when these GAGs were subsequently dosed back into the media of growing MG-63 cells, their bioactivity did not match the stage at which they had been harvested: all GAG species were able to influence cell survival and growth to varying degrees but were not capable of affecting cell differentiation. However, if these same GAGs were exposed to cells by first being attached to the growth substrate, they induced varying degrees of aggregation in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), with more mature GAGs producing the most profound effects. Interestingly, a similar phenomenon was not observed when MG-63 cells where cultured in a similar manner. A direct correlation between the GAGs expressed by osteoblasts and the specific cellular processes they functionally influence has yet to be identified. While the experiments presented here demonstrate an effect of GAGs in osteoblastic cell survival, a role for GAGs in the progression of bone formation was not revealed. Loss-of-function studies were therefore necessary to determine the role of GAGs in bone, but this was hampered by the limited availability of procedures that allow the alteration of GAGs and the subsequent detection of these effects. Therefore, a tool to screen the efficacy of a loss of GAG function was developed. TAT-EGFP, a purpose-designed fluorescent GAG-binding peptide, was able to confirm that treatment with sodium chlorate was an effective 8 strategy to hinder GAG expression in MG-63 cells with minimal cytotoxicity to the cells. Following more extensive studies with chlorate treatment, it was found that a recoverable disruption to both proliferation and mineralisation could be induced in MG-63 cells. This suggested a role for GAGs in osteogenesis. A series of experiments then carried out following gene expression microarray analysis indicated that GAG de-sulfation by chlorate gives rise to an S-phase block in the cell cycle and a disruption to the actin cytoskeleton, which appeared to be associated with a change in the activity of cell-surface proteoglycans, most likely syndecan 4. It was also found that cells up-regulated plasma membrane ALP activity and cholesterol synthesis, presumably in an attempt to recover from a chlorate-induced loss in GAG function. Cholesterol is known to be important in establishing connections between membrane elements and the actin cytoskeleton, and its up-regulation here may reflect dysfunctions in these units and a dysfunction in syndecan 4 activity. With further confirmation, this would suggest that syndecan 4 plays a pivotal role in maintaining osteogenesis, in at least MG-63 cells, and that sulfated GAGs function principally to facilitate this role. The effective use of GAGs in bone repair strategies will require further understanding of GAG/syndecan 4/osteogenesis relationship.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bone</field><field name="subject">osteogenesis</field><field name="subject">poly(&#946;-hydroxybutyrate-co-&#946;-hydroxyvalerate)</field><field name="subject">glycsoaminoglycan</field><field name="subject">heparan sulfate</field><field name="subject">chondriotin sulfate</field><field name="subject">MG-63</field><field name="subject">syndecan 4</field><field name="subject">chlorate</field><field name="subject">extracellular matrix</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179707</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermalisation, correlations and entanglement in Bose-Einstein condensates</field><field name="creator">Andrew James Ferris</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates thermalisation, correlations and entanglement in Bose-Einstein condensates. Bose-Einstein condensates are ultra-cold collections of identical bosonic atoms which accumulate in a single quantum state, forming a mesoscopic quantum object. They are clean and controllable quantum many-body systems that permit an unprecedented degree of experimental flexibility compared to other physical systems. Further, a tractable microscopic theory exists which allows a direct and powerful comparison between theory and experiment, propelling the field of quantum atom optics forward at an incredible pace. Here we explore some of the fundamental frontiers of the field, examining how non-classical correlations and entanglement can be created and measured, as well as how non-classical effects can lead to the rapid heating of atom clouds. We first investigate correlations between two weakly coupled condensates, a system analogous to a superconducting Josephson junction. The ground state of this system contains non-classical number correlation arising from the repulsion between the atoms. Such states are of interest because they may lead to more precise measurement devices such as atomic gyroscopes. Unfortunately thermal fluctuations can destroy these correlations, and great care is needed to experimentally observe non-classical effects. We show that adiabatic evolution can drive the isolated quantum system out of thermal equilibrium and decrease thermal noise, in agreement with a recent experiment [Esteve et al. Nature 455, 1216 (2008)]. This technique may be valuable for observing and using quantum correlated states in the future. Next, we analyse the rapid heating that occurs when a condensate is placed in a moving periodic potential. The dynamical instability responsible for the heating was the subject of much uncertainty, which we suggest was due to the inability of the mean-field approximation to account for important spontaneous scattering processes. We show that a model including non-classical spontaneous scattering can describe dynamical instabilities correctly in each of the regimes where they have been observed, and in particular we compare our simulations to an experiment performed at the University of Otago deep inside the spontaneous scattering regime. Finally, we proposed a method to create and detect entangled atomic wave-packets. Entangled atoms are interesting from a fundamental perspective, and may prove useful in future quantum information and precision measurement technologies. Entanglement is generated by interactions, such as atomic collisions in Bose-Einstein condensates. We analyse the type of entanglement generated via atomic collisions and introduce an abstract scheme for detecting entanglement and demonstrating the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox with ultra-cold atoms. We further this result by proposing an experiment where entangled wave-packets are created and detected. The entanglement is generated by the pairwise scattering that causes the instabilities in moving periodic potentials mentioned above. By careful arrangement, the instability process can be controlled to to produce two well-defined atomic wave-packets. The presence of entanglement can be proven by applying a series of laser pulses to interfere the wave-packets and then measuring the output populations. Realising this experiment is feasible with current technology.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bose-Einstein condensate</field><field name="subject">quantum mechanics</field><field name="subject">thermalisation</field><field name="subject">entanglement</field><field name="subject">ultracold atoms</field><field name="subject">correlations</field><field name="subject">squeezing</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179732</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of post-translational modification sites in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor</field><field name="creator">Keyur Dave</field><field name="description">The dioxin receptor (DR), a transcription factor with basic-helix-loop-helix/PERARNTSIM (bHLH/PAS) homology domains, is activated by toxic xenobiotic ligands leading to severe physiological disturbances most of which are due to deregulation of receptor&#8217;s central role in normal development. Activation mechanisms of DR in the presence of exogenous or endogenous ligands are poorly understood. Elucidation of factors involved in the activation of the receptor would assist not only in development of an optimal measure for risk assessment of levels of common environmental pollutants but also in providing novel targets for therapeutic interventions. Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) play an indispensable role in all major signal transduction pathways by increasing the inventory of chemical modifications beyond those already present in the side-chains of common amino acids. Thus, by simple on/off or complex patterns generated by these PTMs, they control a myriad of different biological outcomes. Numerous studies that have suggested an important role of posttranslational modifications in DR activation has prompted a search in this direction, however, apart from phosphorylations at Ser36 and Ser68 no other PTM sites are known. Advanced mass spectrometry (MS)-based characterisation of PTMs is an established technique that can comprehensively provide an accurate cast of all PTM variants and their locations on a protein. This thesis reports the first MS-based comprehensive characterisation of all PTM sites of the purified latent DR and preliminary analysis of identified PTM sites of the activated DR in response to developmental signals (suspension-activated DR) and signals leading to toxic outcomes (ligand-activated DR). The PTM map of the latent DR revealed from this study comprises of 25 phosphorylations, 4 monomethyl-lysines, 2 dimethyl-lysines, 1 O-acetyl-serine and 2 O-sulfono-serines. Most of the phosphorylations and other PTMs were present in the conserved regions of the protein. Investigation of the activated samples of the receptor revealed loss of the above repertoire of modifications and possible presence of some rarer modifications such as O-acetyl-serines in suspension-activated instead of O-sulfonations and pyrophosphorylation at Ser716 in both suspension- as well as ligand-activated DR. A comprehensive mutagenesis study is in progress to understand the functional consequence of each of these modification sites and unravel the functional posttranslational system in DR signalling.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mass spectrometry, phosphorylation, dioxin receptor, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, proteomics, sulfonation, dimethylation, post-translational modifications</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179743</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimal Control of Finite Dimensional Quantum Systems</field><field name="creator">Paulo Marques Furtado de Mendonca</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the problem of developing a quantum counter-part of the well established classical theory of control. We dwell on the fundamental fact that quantum states are generally not perfectly distinguishable, and quantum measurements typically introduce noise in the system being measured. Because of these, it is generally not clear whether the central concept of the classical control theory --- that of observing the system and then applying feedback --- is always useful in the quantum setting. We center our investigations around the problem of transforming the state of a quantum system into a given target state, when the system can be prepared in different ways, and the target state depends on the choice of preparation. We call this the "quantum tracking problem" and show how it can be formulated as an optimization problem that can be approached both numerically and analytically. This problem provides a simple route to the characterization of the quantum trade-off between information gain and disturbance, and is seen to have several applications in quantum information. In order to characterize the optimality of our tracking procedures, some figure-of-merit has to be specified. Naturally, distance measures for quantum states are the ideal candidates for this purpose. We investigated several possibilities, and found that there is usually a compromise between physically motivated and mathematically tractable measures. We also introduce an alternative to the Uhlmann-Jozsa fidelity for mixed quantum states, which besides reproducing a number of properties of the standard fidelity, is especially attractive because it is simpler to compute. We employ some ideas of convex analysis to construct optimal control schemes analytically. In particular, we obtain analytic forms of optimal controllers for stabilizing and tracking any pair of states of a single-qubit. In the case of stabilization, we find that feedback control is always useful, but because of the trade-off between information gain and disturbance, somewhat different from the type of feedback performed in classical systems. In the case of tracking, we find that feedback is not always useful, meaning that depending on the choice of states one wants to achieve, it may be better not to introduce any noise by the application of quantum measurements. We also demonstrate that our optimal controllers are immediately applicable in several quantum information applications such as state-dependent cloning, purification, stabilization, and discrimination. In all of these cases, we were able to recover and extend previously known optimal strategies and performances. Finally we show how optimal single-step control schemes can be concatenated to provide multi-step strategies that usually over-perform optimal control protocols based on a single interaction between the controller and the system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quantum control</field><field name="subject">state transformation</field><field name="subject">quantum channels</field><field name="subject">distance measures</field><field name="subject">semidefinite programming</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179753</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Oxidative Stress and Cardiovascular Remodelling in Rats: Treatment with anti-oxidants</field><field name="creator">Prasad Chunduri</field><field name="description">Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death globally. Chronic hypertension can lead to a gradual deterioration in the structure and performance of the cardiovascular system in a process described as cardiovascular remodelling. The ultimate response to this remodelling is heart failure. While cardiovascular remodelling is characterised by features such as cardiac and vascular hypertrophy, endothelial dysfunction and fibrosis; mechanisms leading to such pathologies are still unclear. However, oxidative stress, the damage caused by increased production of reactive oxygen species such as free radicals, or their reduced removal by anti-oxidants, appears to have a significant role. The major aim of this thesis is to investigate the involvement of reactive oxygen species in cardiovascular remodelling and to further investigate the potentials of three anti-oxidant approaches (a combination of alpha-lipoic acid and vitamin E, apocynin and a red-wine component, resveratrol) in preventing or reversing cardiovascular remodelling. These studies were conducted in two well-established rat models of cardiovascular remodelling including the deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rat and the ageing spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). Additionally, this thesis also characterises the effects of ovariectomy on the blood pressure and survival rate of female SHR. The cardiovascular structure and function in the animals have been defined using in vivo echocardiography, ex vivo isolated Langendorff heart perfusion, isolated thoracic aortic rings, histological analysis of the myocardial extracellular matrix and inflammation along with terminal organ weight measurements. Reactive oxygen species were assessed through the measurement of plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) while the anti-oxidant capacities have been assessed through measurements of plasma total anti-oxidant status (TAS) and plasma glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity. DOCA-salt treated rats exhibited hypertension, oxidative stress and cardiovascular remodelling, evidenced by their increased left ventricular weights, excess collagen deposition in the heart and increased values for diastolic stiffness, increased plasma MDA concentrations along with impaired contraction and relaxation of the vessels. Treatment with a combination of alpha-lipoic acid and vitamin E or apocynin significantly inhibited the increases in blood pressure, left ventricular weights, cardiac stiffness, interstitial collagen deposition along with improvements in the vascular responses. The treatment of ageing male SHRs with resveratrol, although without any decrease in blood pressure, was shown to reduce left ventricular hypertrophy, fibrosis, diastolic stiffness and improve functional performance of the heart. The level of oxidative stress was also lowered in the male SHRs treated with resveratrol as evidenced by decreased plasma MDA and increased TAS. Female SHRs had a higher blood pressure and diastolic stiffness compared to their age-matched WKYs. Similar to male SHRs, treatment with resveratrol did not affect blood pressure, but attenuated the increased diastolic stiffness, in female SHRs. Furthermore, the ovariectomised SHRs were proven to be extremely hypertensive and had a significantly poorer survival rate. Overall, these studies demonstrated great potential for the alpha-lipoic acid and vitamin E combination and apocynin in the treatment of cardiovascular remodelling. However, further clinical and experimental research is essential to confirm the complete cardiovascular health benefits of resveratrol or red wine intake.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">oxidative stress</field><field name="subject">antioxidants</field><field name="subject">cardiovascular remodelling</field><field name="subject">Hypertension</field><field name="subject">hypertrophy</field><field name="subject">Rats</field><field name="subject">DOCA</field><field name="subject">SHR</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179762</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of an internet-based treatment for childhood anxiety (BRAVE for Children-ONLINE): An evaluation of efficacy and factors associated with treatment outcome</field><field name="creator">Sonja March</field><field name="description">The efficacy of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) in the treatment of child anxiety disorders has been well established in the literature, with on average, just over 50% of children becoming free of their primary anxiety diagnosis immediately following treatment (James et al., 2008). Despite the existence of these efficacious treatments, up to two thirds of children with anxiety do not receive assistance for their difficulties (Essau et al., 2002). The reasons for this are varied, and include lack of available therapists or services, long waiting lists, high therapy costs and stigma associated with therapy. Computer- and internet-based interventions represent a modern alternative for delivering CBT interventions that may be more appealing and accessible to a greater proportion of children with anxiety. Various forms of computer-assisted therapies have been investigated, including palmtop computers, desktop computers, virtual reality and online programs. Although computerised interventions have demonstrated promise in the treatment of adult anxiety, they have only recently received interest in the child literature. Specifically, there are very few controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of computer- and internet-based interventions for childhood psychological disorders, including anxiety disorders. The present research involved the initial development and subsequent testing of an entirely internet-based, CBT intervention for child anxiety disorders. BRAVE-ONLINE was developed as an internet adaptation of The BRAVE Program, a clinic-based program which has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of childhood anxiety. The online intervention is a therapist-mediated program, in which children and parents receive email and telephone assistance from a therapist throughout treatment. BRAVE-ONLINE is an interactive program consisting of 10 child and 6 parent sessions to be completed by families in their own home. Following the development of BRAVE&#8211;ONLINE, the first study of this thesis included a randomised control trial to investigate the efficacy of the internet-based intervention (NET) compared to a waitlist control (WL). Seventy-three children aged between 7 and 12 years, diagnosed with separation anxiety disorder, social phobia, generalised anxiety disorder or specific phobia were randomly allocated to NET and WL conditions. Treatment effects were evaluated at 10-14 weeks post-assessment and 6-month follow-up, using multiple outcome measures including a diagnostic interview, clinician ratings of severity, parent and child questionnaires. Results indicated that at post-assessment, 30% of NET participants in the completer sample (22.5% in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) sample) no longer met criteria for their primary anxiety diagnosis, compared to 10% of WL participants. Significant gains were also evident for clinician severity ratings, global assessments of functioning, and several questionnaire measures. However, results also indicated that children and parents were slow to progress through therapy, such that a large proportion of families had not completed all treatment sessions at the post-assessment point. For this reason, 6-month follow-up may present a better indication of treatment efficacy. Indeed, at 6-month follow-up, treatment gains were improved upon such that 75% of children in the completer sample (52.5% in the ITT sample) no longer met criteria for their primary anxiety disorder. Reductions in severity ratings, global assessments of functioning and child and parent self-report measures were also improved upon at 6-month follow-up. Further, the online intervention was found to be highly acceptable to families and was associated with only minimal rates of attrition. The second study of this thesis aimed to explore factors associated with treatment outcome for the online intervention. Factors of interest included demographic factors (age, gender, income and educational background), treatment expectancy, initial symptom severity, program compliance and pre-treatment diagnostic comorbidity. Specifically, this study investigated the extent to which each of these factors predicted the improvement made by children on global assessments of functioning (CGAS) at 6-month follow-up. Results indicated that only some of these factors were directly associated with treatment outcome. Although treatment expectancy predicted compliance with the program, it was not associated with treatment outcome. Baseline severity also did not predict treatment outcome. Contrary to expectation, levels of program compliance by children negatively predicted outcome, such that children who were more compliant with the program showed fewer improvements in overall functioning. Parent compliance did not predict treatment outcome. A significant relationship was evident between diagnostic comorbidity (number of pre-treatment anxiety diagnoses) and treatment outcome, such that higher baseline comorbidity predicted poorer functioning on the CGAS at 6-month follow-up. None of the demographic factors were associated with treatment outcome. Overall, the findings of this research suggest that a CBT intervention delivered entirely over the internet was associated with reductions in indicators of anxiety at post-assessment, compared to a WL control, particularly for the completer sample. Further, these reductions were improved upon at 6-month follow-up, with a substantial proportion of children becoming free of their primary anxiety diagnosis. The results also indicated that the online intervention might not be as effective for children suffering from multiple anxiety disorders. The effects of program compliance were somewhat surprising and possible explanations are offered. Although these results are promising, conclusions should be regarded as tentative until further trials are conducted and the online intervention is compared with clinic-based treatments. Limitations of this research and areas for future research are discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Child Anxiety</field><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">Computer</field><field name="subject">Online Therapy</field><field name="subject">Randomized Controlled Trials</field><field name="subject">Predictors of treatment outcome</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179806</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Equine laminitis: ultrastructural changes, lamellar microcirculation and drug delivery</field><field name="creator">Alireza Nourian</field><field name="description">In order to investigate the early ultrastructural lesions at the first sign of lameness in the oligofructose (OF) model of laminitis, the disease was induced in four horses, while another four horses were sham-treated controls. Minor lesions were detected in lamellar samples examined by light microscopy. Examination by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed excessive waviness, breaks and separation of portions of lamellar basement membrane (BM) in the treated horses. There was also disintegration and disappearance of hemidesmosomes (HD) and epidermal basal cell (EBC) cytoskeleton, and an increase in the distance between the EBC plasmalemma and the centre of the BM. A link was thus established between the first clinical signs of lameness and ultrastructural changes in the lamellar dermo-epidermal interface. This implied that pathogenesis was underway well before clinical signs (24 h) and that successful therapy would need to be instituted earlier than previously considered. Earlier therapy may be facilitated if delivery of efficacious drugs to the foot was achievable. A treatment modality that delivered effective concentrations of anti laminitic drugs to the target organ (the epidermal lamellae) was thus an objective of this study. Hoof lamellar tissue from five ponies treated with prolonged euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemia and four control (sham-treated) ponies were harvested and processed for TEM. Lamellae from treated ponies showed attenuation and elongation of secondary epidermal lamellae (SEL), HD number reduction and infiltration of leukocytes. Unlike carbohydrate induced laminitis in horses, there was no global separation at the lamellar dermal/epidermal interface in ponies. Two unique lamellar lesions found in this induction model was mitosis among EBCs and thickening of the BM, not normally characteristic of acute laminitis. The pathophysiology of hyperinsulinaemic laminitis remains unresolved but if insulin, delivered directly to the foot, induced laminitis several pathophysiological questions would be answered. In particular, it would emphasise the laminitogenic potential of insulin alone in the pathogenesis of laminitis. It also allows the treatment foot to be compared with the remaining three that act as internal controls. A modality that delivered drugs like insulin to the target organ (the epidermal lamellae) was needed and was an objective of this study. A microdialysis (MD) method, based on continuous sampling of the lamellar extracellular fluid (ECF), was developed to monitor lamellar drug concentrations. MD probes were implanted in the hoof lamellar tissue of six normal Standardbred horses under local anaesthesia. A bolus intravenous (IV) dose (5 mg/kg BWT) of gentamicin sulfate was injected into the jugular vein. MD and blood samples were collected at different time points during 24 h, and calibrated and analyzed using an ELISA method for gentamicin. During the first 8 h, the concentration of gentamicin was significantly higher in blood than lamellar ECF, a result that is reversed when lamellar MD is repeated during IO infusion of gentamicin. The results showed that this modestly invasive method was a useful tool to monitor changes in the lamellar ECF during drug delivery or during laminitis development. Knowledge of the anatomy and dynamics of blood circulation in the equine foot is fundamental to understand laminitis pathophysiology. Using histology, decalcification, diaphanization, computed tomography (CT), micro CT and gelatin-India Ink vascular perfusion, the normal anatomy of the dorsal part of distal phalanx (DP) and its vascular relationship to hoof lamellae was characterised. The results showed a close relationship between the distal phalangeal and lamellar circulations and raised the possibility of accessing the lamellar circulation via the DP and the possibility that IO perfusion (IOP) of the DP could deliver drugs to the lamellae. IOP of the DP with methyl methacrylate (MMA) corrosion casting material resulted in filling of the lamellar and sublamellar vascular network and incomplete filling of lamellar capillaries. Perfusion of common digital artery with a suspension of barium sulfate resulted in filling of lamellar arteries but not capillaries. Perfusion of the common digital vein resulted in filling of lamellar veins but not capillaries. Perfusion with barium sulfate partitioned veins from arteries because particle size prevented entry into capillaries. IOP with barium sulfate filled only veins revealing that vascular egress from the DP was venous. This study showed that a retrograde venous connection exists between the DP and lamellar circulations with the potential for lamellar drug delivery. Intra-arterial (IA) and IO infusion results using gelatin-India Ink were markedly improved when cadaver limbs were subjected to cyclic loading within the physiological range. Without loading lamellar capillaries failed to fill no matter what the injection pressure. Cyclic loading cadaver limbs 6 times resulted in complete lamellar capillary filling and suggested that cyclic limb loading contributed to perfusion of lamellar capillaries normally in horses. To evaluate IO delivery of drugs to hoof lamellae in the standing, conscious horse, gentamicin solution (25 mg/mL) was slowly infused (20 &#181;L/min) through an IO bone screw. Lamellar ECF was collected via a lamellar MD probe and blood was collected from the jugular vein. Gentamicin was 50-100 times more concentrated in lamellar ECF than in blood. This study introduces a potential method for delivery of drugs into the lamellar tissue in the standing, conscious horse. Laminitis pathology occurs before clinical signs and can be induced by insulin as well as enteric OF overload. Thus therapy delivered to the target of laminitis, the hoof lamellae, has an improved chance of success if delivered promptly, safely and at high concentrations. A validated drug delivery and lamellar analysis system that achieves these criteria, was the discovery of this project and is now available to combat laminitis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Equine, laminitis, ultrastructural, microcirculation, microdialysis, intraosseous</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179841</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prevalence and correlates of psychotic-like experiences in the Australian community</field><field name="creator">James Scott</field><field name="description">Background: Apart from individuals with clinical psychosis, community surveys have shown that many otherwise-well individuals endorse items designed to identify psychosis. The clinical relevance of psychotic-like experiences (PLE) in individuals who are not psychotic is not clear. This thesis aimed to examine the prevalence, demographic and psychosocial correlates and antecedents of PLE in the Australian community. Method: Data from three population-based studies was examined. The Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing interviewed 10,641 individuals living in private dwellings in Australia. We examined the impact of selected demographic variables on endorsement of psychosis screen and probe items from the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). We also examined the effect of exposure to traumatic events (with and without Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)) on the endorsement of CIDI psychosis items. The youth component of the Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing collected demographic and clinical data on a nationally representative sample of 1261 adolescents aged 13-17 years. The prevalence of hallucination endorsement on the Youth Self Report (YSR) in Australian adolescents was examined. The association between hallucination endorsement, demographic variables (sex, age, urbanicity and family composition) and clinical variables (self-reported depression, marijuana and alcohol use, DSM IV diagnoses, emotional/ behavioral problems as reported by the parent on the Child Behaviour Check List (CBCL)) were examined. The Mater- University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy (MUSP) is a prospective longitudinal birth cohort study of 7223 mothers and their offspring who received antenatal care between 1981 and 1984. Psychotic-like experiences were assessed in the offspring at the 21 year follow-up using the Peters Delusional Inventory (PDI) and the CIDI. We examined the prevalence of PLEs, and examined the effect of age (the age range at the 21 year follow-up was 18 to 23 years) and sex on PLE. A second study examined the emotional and behavioural antecedents of PLE at 21 years as measured by the CBCL at five and 14 years and the YSR at 14 years. Results: An estimated 11.7% of Australian adults endorsed at least one psychosisscreening item. Higher endorsement was associated with younger age, migrants from non- English speaking backgrounds, not being married, unemployment, living in an urban region and lowest socioeconomic levels. Exposure to any traumatic event was associated with increased endorsement of PLE (Rate Ratio =2.68; 95% CI 2.18, 3.30). A diagnosis of PTSD further increased endorsement of PLE (Rate Ratio =9.24; 95% CI 6.95, 12.27). Hallucinations were reported by 8.4% of Australian adolescents. Those living in blended or sole parent families were more likely to report hallucinations than those living with both biological parents (OR 3.27; 95% CI 1.93, 5.54; OR 2.60; 95% CI 1.63, 4.13 respectively). Hallucinations were more prevalent in adolescents who had high CBCL scores or elevated depression symptoms (OR 3.30; 95% CI 2.10, 5.20; OR 5.02; 95% CI 3.38, 7.45 respectively). Hallucinations were more prevalent in those adolescents who had smoked cannabis more than twice in the month prior to the survey (OR 3.27; 95% CI 1.76, 6.08). In the 21 year follow-up of the MUSP study, older age (18-20 compared to 21-23 years) was significantly associated with a reduction of CIDI delusions (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48, 0.92) and PDI total scores (OR=0.68, 95% CI 0.55, 0.83). Women were significantly more likely to endorse items related to hallucinations (OR=1.49, 95% CI 1.14, 1.95) but not delusions. High CBCL scores at 5 and 14 years predicted high total PDI scores; Those in the highest quartile of YSR scores at 14 years were nearly four times more likely to have high levels of psychotic-like experiences at age 21 (OR=3.71, 95% CI 2.92, 4.71). Adolescent onset psychopathology and continuous psychopathology through both childhood and adolescence strongly predict PLE at age 21. Conclusions: Psychotic-like experiences are relatively common in population surveys of Australian adults and adolescents. In adults, the demographic correlates of PLE are similar to those of schizophrenia. There is a strong association between PLE and exposure to trauma. The correlates of PLE in adolescents are different to those of adults. The reduction in prevalence of delusions between late adolescence and young adulthood is coincident with normal neurophysiological changes in the frontal lobes, suggesting hypotheses suitable for future research. The association between marijuana use and hallucinations in adolescents is further evidence of the potential harm caused by use of cannabis. The onset or persistence of emotional distress during adolescence is associated with an increased risk of PLE in adulthood. These findings are relevant to both clinical practice and future research. Psychotic symptoms create diagnostic uncertainty. There is potential for patients with anxiety (PTSD) or mood disorders to be incorrectly diagnosed with a psychotic illness and receive inappropriate management. Equally, there is a risk that subjects who have an emerging psychotic disorder and comorbid anxiety or depression or have had exposure to traumatic events may have treatment of their psychosis delayed as psychotic symptoms are incorrectly ascribed to a syndrome other than psychosis. Clinicians need to be aware of this diagnostic tension so that accurate assessments and appropriate treatments can be initiated at the earliest possible opportunity. The resolution of childhood emotional distress prior to adolescence appears to reduce the risk of PLE and possibly psychosis in adults. Strategies targeting emotionally distressed children may offer opportunities for psychosis prevention. Further research is required to explore the relationship between PLE and vulnerability to psychosis and other mental health problems. It remains unclear if PLE are reliable endophenotypes for schizophrenia. If this is the case, examining genetic and environmental risk factors for onset and persistence of PLE, and the neuroimaging changes that occur as individuals with PLE convert to psychosis will provide important new clues to our understanding of the aetiopathogenesis of psychosis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychotic-like experiences</field><field name="subject">psychosis</field><field name="subject">trauma</field><field name="subject">epidemiology</field><field name="subject">adolescents</field><field name="subject">psychopathology</field><field name="subject">birth cohort</field><field name="subject">mental health survey</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179883</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Farmer Perceptions of Several Rodent Pest Management Methods and the Trap-Barrier System (TBS) in Cambodia</field><field name="creator">Sotheary El</field><field name="description">In Cambodia, over 80% of the population is engaged in agricultural production, mostly in rice cultivation. The country, however, faces a lot of problems of rice crop damage. In Cambodia, rodents are considered to be one of the most important pests of rice, with the potential to cause severe damage during periodic plague events. As is seen in other developing countries, physical methods of rodent control are probably the most commonly used approaches. In general, the choice of methods varies with the availability of resources, season, the participation of farmers, the condition of the rice field, weather conditions, experience with the success of the techniques, likely level of rodent attack and other considerations. However, effective rodent control methods suiting farmers&#8217; needs and applicable to the agricultural production environment in Cambodia are yet to be assessed. The aim of this research was to examine the socio-economic factors impacting on the implementation of several rodent control methods in comparison to the Trap-Barrier System (TBS) in order to improve rodent pest control in Cambodia. The research employed a constructivist approach in which the researcher played a role as a participant observer, to study the social setting and realities as constructed by the participants in the study sites. Rodent management was studied as a complex phenomenon, occurring within the milieu of family, village and commune life in rural Cambodia. The study looks into the beliefs and behaviours of the farming community and examines how Cambodian traditions affect the implementation of rodent management techniques and the management of rodents as a community activity. Participatory techniques were employed to gather information concerning the farmers&#8217; assessments of the effectiveness of various rodent management options practiced in Samrong Commune. The level of adoption and adaptation of TBS in the commune was observed over a period of several years. This study is the first detailed study of farmer perceptions of alternative rodent control methods in Cambodia, especially the TBS. The study was based on long term trials involving a TBS application on a commune scale and investigations after the removal of all subsidies for purchase of materials. It was apparent that TBS use declined and eventually become limited to a few individuals who had worked closely with the project. The study also demonstrates how BBNs and Netica software can be applied as participatory tools to develop and explore the decision making structure of farmers. These tools can also be used as extension tools and can contribute to better decision making by communities. The study also shows how an understanding of traditional aspects of public goods management by communities can contribute to the design of effective contemporary solutions to problems involving the community and public goods management. In this sense its significance goes well beyond the specific context of rodent control, pest management and rice production and takes on wider significance in the field of community development generally. The study applied a mixed qualitative and quantitative approach to data collection and analysis, involving interviews, surveys, modelling, workshops, field notes, observations and document review. Five rodent control methods (TBS, rodenticide, electric fencing, netting and hunting) were found to be the most common rodent control methods used in the study sites. Some common factors were found to influence the effectiveness of these methods. Farmer participation was found to be the most widely influential factor affecting the rodent management techniques. Netting method was considered the most effective method of rodent control by farmers, as well as the method that had the best benefit-cost ratio. This technique was only found to be applicable in the wet season. In general, the effectiveness of TBS and its benefit-cost ratio was ranked fourth of the five methods, because it required high farmer participation, monitoring and maintenance as well as high material expense. Improvement of TBS can be made when it can be clearly demonstrated to farmers that TBS is an applicable method, being safe and able to catch more rats. To suit the farmers&#8217; requirements for an effective rodent control method, TBS must be able to deal with migrating rats, situations of high rat abundance and the planting problems associated with an irregular rain regime. To achieve these conditions, some intervention policies are required in terms of research and extension support.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">trap-barrier system</field><field name="subject">rodent management</field><field name="subject">cambodia</field><field name="subject">rodenticide</field><field name="subject">electrical fence</field><field name="subject">netting</field><field name="subject">hunting</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179902</field></doc><doc><field name="title">HIGH RESOLUTION ULTRASOUND SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF BOVINE MUSCLE</field><field name="creator">Timothy Sweet</field><field name="description">Accurate and reliable measurement of meat quality is essential for the Australian beef industry to remain competitive in both the domestic and export markets. Recent developments of the resonator technique have lead to the commercial availability of the High Resolution Ultrasound Spectroscope (HR-US). This research project was designed to assess the potential of HR-US for the analysis of post-mortem bovine muscle. This was accomplished by; 1) establishing a suitable measurement protocol that considered sources of variability, 2) the effects of post-mortem aging on HR-US parameters, 3) analysis of thermal related changes that occur in muscle, and extracted connective tissue during heating, and 4) the use of HR-US for the measurement of the intramuscular fat. A procedure for the measurement of bovine muscle with HR-US was established. Briefly, an external semisolid cell was used as the measurement cell. The frequency range of 2000 KHz to 3000 KHz was selected as the most suitable for whole muscle analysis and all five resonance peaks within this range were analysed and used to obtain velocity and attenuation values of the meat sample. Water was used as the reference media, and measurements were conducted at 250C. Changes were made to this method during experimental work depending on the sample being run and the objectives of the study. The measurement protocol was shown to be repeatable. Factors likely to cause variation in measurements of the samples, such as water loss and freeze-thaw, were also considered when developing the operational parameters of the study. High resolution ultrasound spectroscopy was applied to measure the post-mortem changes that occur in bovine muscle. Using two muscle types, Semitendinosus and Psoas major, significant changes were observed in HR-US parameters with ageing. Significant increases in the acoustic impedance of bovine muscle with increased ageing time were attributed to degradation of the muscle structure. This was confirmed in transmission electron microscopy images where clear disruption the myofibillar structure was apparent in the muscle at 21 days post-mortem.In localised regions the Z bands and the adjoining actin fibres were totally degraded. Water loss from the muscle system had a significant influence on HR-US measurements. Thermal related changes that occur in whole bovine muscle and in isolated intramuscular connective tissue were observed with HR-US. Heat induced changes were identified in whole muscles and included the melting of the fat within samples at 48oC, coagulation of sarcoplasmic proteins between 450C and 55oC, and the shrinkage of collagen fibres at 630C. An 80% reduction in the attenuating properties of extracted connective ageing in buffer solution was observed within the first 5 days. This is attributed to the degradation of proteoglycans and the resulting disassociation of collagen fibrils. Structural changes occurring in extracted connective tissue were observed with TEM. HR-US measurements proved to be highly sensitive to identifying temperatures at which transitions occurred. Unfolding of the triple helix structure of collagen was identified in velocity transitions between 59&#176;C and 63oC. HR-US results suggested a greater sensitivity to thermal related changes in extracted intramuscular connective tissue when compared with differential scanning calorimeter results. An increase in temperature was observed for thermal denaturation of collagen with ageing, however a reduction was also observed in the temperature range at which the denaturation process occurred. Temperature ramps conducted on extracted intramuscular bovine showed a reduction in velocity from 1613.1m/s at 250C to 1343.1 m/s at 900C equalling an overall reduction in velocity of 270m/s. A transition in the velocity trend seen at 46&#176;C indicates the majority of the triglycerides are melted (or in liquid state) above this temperature. Results are confirmed with differential scanning calorimeter thermogram. HR-US measurements showed high sensitivity to increasing concentration of bovine fat in prepared emulsions with an adjusted R2 99.46% for velocity measurements taken at 5100 kHz. Attenuation values at 8100 kHz also showed a strong linear response to increasing fat concentration in the emulsion (R2 98.77). The use of HR-US for the measurement of intramuscular bovine fat demonstrated a high sensitivity to extracted bovine fat in prepared emulsions. An increase in the intramuscular fat content of whole bovine muscles resulted in a reduction in the velocity measurements and an increase in the attenuation of the ultrasonic signal. This provides the basis for potential method for the prediction intramuscular fat in bovine muscle. The present studies have highlighted the complexities of investigations relating to meat quality and have demonstrated the diversity of data required to assess quality. Only when comprehensive data are available, can we hope to accurately determine meat quality and predict how it will vary with changes in animal production and meat processing.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">resonant ultrasound</field><field name="subject">bovine</field><field name="subject">muscle fibres</field><field name="subject">protein denaturation</field><field name="subject">collagen</field><field name="subject">spectroscopy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179935</field></doc><doc><field name="title">INVESTIGATION OF CELL MEDIATED IMMUNITY TO MALARIA</field><field name="creator">Yawalak Panpisutchai</field><field name="description">Malaria is a life-threatening parasitic disease endemic throughout the world. Control methods for malaria are becoming less reliable; thus, efforts to develop a safe and effective vaccine are critical. Immunity to malaria requires both cell- and humoral-mediated immunity, CMI and HMI, respectively. CD4+ T cells play a central role in protection against blood stage Plasmodium infection. Given that clinical features of malaria are caused by blood stages, a vaccine against this stage will be very effective in reducing morbidity and mortality. During the blood stage, purine nucleotides, which are essential for parasites&#8217; survival and proliferation, are in high demand. The inability of the parasite to engage in de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides makes the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGXPRT) an essential nutrient salvage enzyme. HGXPRT is located in electron-dense regions in merozoites and in vesicles in the red cell cytoplasm. In contrast to other blood stage antigens, those located on the merozoite surface are targets of HMI. To advance HGXPRT as a malaria vaccine candidate, fermentation and purification of the protein from Plasmodium falciparum (PfHGXPRT) was performed using facilities at Q-Gen, the Queensland Institute of Medical Research (QIMR). Escherichia coli carrying PfHGXPRT gene were a gift in-kind from the University of Queensland (UQ). Recombinant PfHGXPRT expressed in E.coli was purified using anion exchange liquid chromatography and gel filtration techniques. Three methods were used to confirm the Q-Gen PfHGXPRT identity: (1) Western blotting showing identical bands of UQ PfHGXPRT and Q-Gen PfHGXPRT at 26 kDa; (2) N terminal sequencing was compatible with the PfHGXPRT sequence; and (3) mass spectrometry showed homogeneity by giving a subunit molecular mass of 26,231 Da. The purification method used is reproducible and affordable, yielding reasonably pure protein for animal experimentation. Following purification of PfHGXPRT, its efficacy as a subunit vaccine candidate in a rodent model of infection was examined. Multiple rodent models of malaria infection were assessed and it was determined that Plasmodium chabaudi AS (P. chabaudi AS) exhibited the highest cross-reactivity against PfHGXPRT in mice. Hence, P. chabaudi AS was chosen as the appropriate rodent model for study in this thesis. Natural immunity against PfHGXPRT during a blood stage P. chabaudi AS infection was assessed by testing sera and splenocyte responses to PfHGXPRT. IFN-&#61543; and IL-4, as well as antibodies specific for PfHGXPRT, could be detected after infection, suggesting that PfHGXPRT is a target of natural immunity during the blood stage infection. Therefore, further studies of protective immunity generated by immunisation with PfHGXPRT were conducted, specifically to determine their protective efficacy and to determine immune mechanisms elicited by immunisation. Mice immunised with PfHGXPRT and challenged with P. chabaudi AS developed a slightly reduced parasitaemia. T-cell proliferation, but not antibody responses, was detected after immunisation. Protective mechanism(s) were assessed by adoptively transferring immune CD4+ T cells, B cells or sera to na&#239;ve SCID mice followed by parasite challenge. Only recipients of immune CD4+ T cells showed extended survival. Nevertheless, immunisation with PfHGXPRT followed by sub-patent infection induced better protection than immunisation with PfHGXPRT alone, which appeared to be related to CD4+ T cells. Reduction of parasitaemia, as well as augmentation of T cell proliferation and IFN-&#947; production, was evident in PfHGXPRT and sub-patent infected immunised mice. Recipients of CD4+ T cells from PfHGXPRT and sub-patent infection immune mice also showed some degree of protective immunity. PfHGXPRT was shown to induce natural and acquired immunity to P. chabaudi AS. HGXPRT is highly conserved in parasites and humans; therefore, it is essential to define minimal protective epitopes that could be included in a vaccine. Hence, 22 overlapping peptides (termed P1 P22) corresponding to the entire P. chabaudi AS HGPRT sequence were used to define minimal protective epitopes. Following immunisation of mice with seven pools of peptides (P1 P3, P4 P6, P7 P9, P10 P12, P13 P15, P16 P18 and P19 P22), three immunogenic peptides (P11, P13, and P17), which stimulated significant proliferative and IFN-&#947; responses were chosen for immunisation studies. Peptide P9 (position 76-95 from N-terminal), which induced the highest IFN-&#61543; levels during P. chabaudi AS infection was also included in the pool of peptides. Mice immunised with P9, P11, P13 and P17 had significantly decreased parasitaemia. Antibody mediated immunity had a partial effect on suppressing parasite growth. CMI, on the contrary, played a central role in adoptively transferred protection by significantly reducing parasitaemia and prolonging survival of recipient SCID mice. Strong T cell proliferation and IFN-&#61543; secretion were also detected after stimulation of splenocytes from immune mice with P. chabaudi AS antigen. CMI response was significantly increased after immunisation with the peptides followed by sub-patent infection. The findings that four short epitopes of HG(X)PRT confer strong CMI protection suggest that homologues of such epitopes could be included in a multi-component malaria vaccine.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">malaria</field><field name="subject">malaria vaccine</field><field name="subject">hgxprt</field><field name="subject">cell mediated immunity</field><field name="subject">purine salvage enzyme</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179936</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding the growth behaviour of epitaxial InAs/GaAs nanowire heterostructures using electron microscopy</field><field name="creator">Mohanchand Paladugu</field><field name="description">Materials in smaller scales exhibit promising properties that are useful for wide variety of applications. Semiconductor quantum wells and quantum dots are two main examples of low-dimensional systems, where the quantum wells act as two-dimensional systems and the quantum dots act as zero-dimensional systems. Alternatively, semiconductor nanowires act as one-dimensional materials, and they exhibit promising and device applicable properties. These nanowires are relatively new class of materials compared to the quantum wells and the quantum dots. The semiconductor nanowires are expected to be the building blocks for future nanoelectronic and nano-optoelectronic device technology. Vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism is a widely used mechanism for the growth of semiconductor nanowires, where metal nanoparticles are used as the catalysts for the nanowires growth. This growth mechanism offers a flexibility to control the size, morphology and location of the semiconductor nanowires. In the VLS growth, changing the chemical composition of vapor constituents produce consequent compositional modulation in each nanowire. The compositional modulation along the nanowire axis produces axial nanowire heterostructures and in radial direction produces radial nanowire heterostructures. Such compositional modulation within an individual nanowire enables the designing of band structure of a nanowire and thereby allows the fabrication of single nanowire devices. These nanowire heterostructures show many potential properties and consequent applications. Although the semiconductor nanowire heterostructures are promising semiconductor nanostructures, the fundamental growth mechanisms of axial and radial nanowire heterostructures have not been explored sufficiently due to their complex nature of the growth. In this regard, this PhD thesis addresses the fundamental issues associated with axial and radial nanowire heterostructures. For such fundamental investigations, this PhD work chooses InAs/GaAs nanowire heterostructure system due to its potential applications. In fact, InAs/GaAs nanowire heterostructures are the first reported axial nanowire heterostructure system. However, no detailed investigations were reported on this system so far. The detailed nucleation and growth mechanisms associated with InAs/GaAs nanowire heterostructure system are explored in this thesis using electron microscopy investigations. This objective is achieved in the following steps. &#8226; InAs/GaAs nanowire heterostructures are grown using Au nanoparticles and metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) method. To determine the axial and radial growth evolution of InAs on GaAs nanowires, different InAs/GaAs nanowire heterostructures are produced by depositing InAs for different durations on GaAs nanowires. The GaAs nanowires are initially grown for 30 min and then the InAs is deposited on these nanowires for 1, 3, 5 and 30 min. &#8226; These InAs/GaAs nanowire heterostructures are subjected to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations. These investigations determine that, in the initial stages of the InAs axial growth (1 min), the Au particles move sidewards and subsequently downwards by maintaining an interface with the GaAs nanowire. Such a movement of Au catalysts is attributed to lower Au/GaAs interfacial energy than Au/InAs. The detailed TEM investigations show that this Au movement depends upon the crystallographic nature of the GaAs nanowire. The Au particle is always tend to move towards {112}B sidewall of the GaAs nanowire rather than its {112}A sidewalls. Increase in InAs growth duration shows that InAs branches evolve from GaAs-InAs core-shell structures. Such evolution is observed in following steps: (1) the movement of Au particle terminates when it encounters the radially grown InAs on GaAs nanowires; (2) further growth of InAs leads to the InAs nanowire growth from those terminated Au nanoparticles in the form of branches. &#8226; The TEM observations of InAs/GaAs nanowire heterostructures show that, in the initial stages of InAs radial growth on GaAs nanowires, InAs nucleates preferentially in the concave regions of the non-planar sidewalls of the GaAs nanowire. The further growth of InAs leads to the preferential formation of InAs shell structure at the regions of concave regions. Such heterogeneous formation of shell structure resembles InAs nanoring structures around GaAs nanowire cores. InAs growth on the planar {112} sidewalls of GaAs nanowires with hexagonal cross sections shows different growth phenomena to the above described InAs nanorings formation. In this case, InAs preferentially nucleates on {112}A sidewalls of the GaAs nanowires and with further deposition of InAs, the complete shell structure of InAs form with {110} sidewalls on the GaAs nanowire cores. &#8226; In addition to the above mentioned investigations, to observe the growth evolution of GaAs on InAs nanowires, GaAs is grown for 3 and 30 min on InAs nanowires. The TEM investigations of these nanostructures show that the axial GaAs/InAs hetero-interface contains an InGaAs transition segment in contrast to the sharp InAs/GaAs (InAs on GaAs) hetero-interface. The different nature of hetero-interfaces is attributed to the different affinities between Au catalysts and Ga or In. The radial growth of GaAs on InAs nanowires show that the GaAs shell has grown in wurtzite structure around the wurtzite structured InAs nanowire cores. Overall, through the extensive SEM and TEM investigations, this PhD thesis addresses the fundamental issues related to the growth of axial and radial nanowire heterostructures. Such fundamental investigations are expected to advance the processing and application prospective of the semiconductor nanowires and their associated heterostructures.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nanowires, nanostructures, heterostructures, nucleation and growth, self-assembly of matter, vapor liquid solid mechanism, materials science, nanotechnology, transmission electron microscopy, crystal growth</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179967</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Correlates of Episodic Memory Functioning in Older and Younger Adults</field><field name="creator">Maria Cabral Collerson</field><field name="description">Abstract This study examined memory functioning from a female perspective, with the aim of determining factors that might impact performance and render the accuracy of memory measurement, particularly with advancing age, problematic. Factors investigated, among others, were the role of attention and/or engagement with the memory tasks administered, state affect (i.e., positive and negative arousal) at time of testing, subjective memory appraisal, particularly in the domain of perceived memory self-efficacy (MSE), and the use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) by older post-menopausal women. Two experimental computer-based tests of episodic memory, Paired Associates (PA) and Serial Recall (SR), were administered to 181 female participants aged 18 to 86 years. The tasks were designed to emphasise components that make episodic memory especially difficult, and minimise the use of strategies that might assist recall. Thus, they varied the requirement for recall as opposed to recognition, the need to form an association between a pair of unrelated words, and the need to discriminate the most recent list from earlier list(s). Other measures used included a demographic survey administered to participants individually in an interview format, and a number of variables examined in this study derived from responses to items contained in this survey. The research battery also included psychometric measures of transient affective states, psychological well-being, alertness, in addition to measures of global cognitive status and metamemory (i.e., subjective memory appraisal). The overall aim was to examine a range of factors that might influence episodic memory performance in cognitively intact healthy women, and thus render the interpretation of age-related changes to memory functioning problematic. For analyses participants were assigned to three groups - young, middle-aged and older. There were 60 young adults aged 18 to 29 years, 60 middle-aged adults aged 49 to 60 years, and 61 older adults aged 61 to 86 years. Each participant was tested individually in a single session lasting approximately 3 &#189; hours, with younger participants requiring less time to complete assessments. Order of test administration and instructions were standardised across the entire sample. Inferential statistics included correlation, t-test statistic, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey post-hoc comparisons. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine key correlates of memory performance outcomes. No significant differences between the cohorts were found in mean years of education. However, episodic memory recall differed significantly by age group. As expected, young adults recalled significantly more words in the memory tasks than their older counterparts, and middle-aged adults outperformed adults in the oldest cohort. Moreover, older adults&#8217; performance deficits were more pronounced in the tasks requiring that they make an association between a pair of unrelated words. Across all cases, transient mood states were significantly related to memory scores; however, individuals in the oldest cohort were particularly vulnerable to mood fluctuations. This cohort experienced a significantly greater decline in positive affect and a significant greater increase in negative affect while undergoing memory testing, highlighting their greater vulnerability to stressors inherent in a memory testing situation. Although scores on the measure of attention were near ceiling, indicative of participants&#8217; level of effort, motivation, and engagement with the memory tasks, the measure of attention discriminated between older and younger adults&#8217; results, and was a key predictor of memory performance. Noteworthy is that attention scores significantly contributed to performance variability in younger and older adults but not in middle-aged adults. Across all cases, age, education, and attention were the key contributing factors to variability in memory scores. Although four lifestyle factors: (1) subjective sleep appraisal, (2) body mass index (BMI), (3) physical activity, and (4) caffeine intake were significantly associated with performance in the memory tasks, once the effects of these key variables were removed, lifestyle factor did not uniquely contribute to performance variability. Moreover, no association was found between hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and episodic memory performance across the broader sample. However, in a small subgroup of older women (n = 15, M age = 66 years), long-term users of this treatment, HRT had a significant effect on memory performance and was indicative of better recall on the memory tasks. The effect of subjective memory appraisal, MSE included, on objective performance outcomes was examined. The results showed that memory self-evaluations were not a significant contributing factor to episodic memory performance, confirming that memory self-appraisal is a poor predictor of actual memory performance, and thus does not pose a challenge to the measurement of age-related changes to memory abilities. Although there were commonalities, factors influencing memory performance differed by age cohort. For example, in young adults, positive mood, a perception of sleeping well, subjective health, and attention were significantly related to performance on the memory tasks. However, once the effect of attention was removed in the regression analysis, no other variable was predictive of episodic memory functioning in this cohort. In contrast, the single significant predictor of memory performance in middle-aged individuals was education, and neither attention, nor positive mood, or physical activity had a significant effect on this cohort&#8217;s performance. Similarly, having more years of formal education benefited older adults&#8217; episodic memory functioning. However, high scores on global cognitive functioning and on the tasks measuring attention were equally important to episodic memory recall in this age group. In sum, the significant contribution of age to memory variability attested to the utility of the memory measures in detecting age-related changes to episodic memory functioning, which were independent of deficits in attention or level of education. Moreover, the effect of several factors (e.g., transient mood, lifestyle) on memory scores was explained by an effect on attention, and this has clear implication for the proper evaluation of long-term changes to memory functioning. Limitations of the study and suggestion for future research are discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">17 Psychology and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="subject">ageing, episodic memory, attention, cognition, metamemory, memory self-efficacy, estrogen, hormone replacement therapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179969</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DESIGNING AND DEVELOPMENT OF SYNTHETIC BARRIER MATERIALS FOR THE PROTECTION OF WOODEN STRUCTURES AGAINST TERMITES</field><field name="creator">Sharad Rajendran</field><field name="description">Although termites serve the ecologically important function of converting dead trees into organic matter, they annually cause damage worth billions of dollars to human structures such as houses, power poles and bridges throughout the world. This led to the development of various chemical and physical measures that primarily aimed at preventing the termites from causing damage to wooden structures. While the adverse effects of the chemical methods on the environment and human health has made them widely unacceptable, physical methods are costly and difficult to implement. There is a specific need to develop an environment friendly, cost effective, easily applicable and durable alternative barrier that would effectively protect a wide range of wooden structures. This study aims at designing and developing an eco-friendly, robust and easy to apply barrier material to protect wooden structures. Ether polyurethane (EPU) was chosen as the base material considering its toughness, resilience, hydrolytic stability due to the presence of ether group and easy applicability on large, irregular surfaces. EPU was upgraded to a &#8216;termite effective&#8217; material by the incorporation of a synthetic pyrethroid, Bifenthrin&#174;. Bifenthrin&#174; was chosen over other termiticides due to its less pervasive nature to the environment along with its repellent/ killer effect on termites. The EPU/ Bifenthrin&#174; system incorporates the specific features of durability of the polymer and slow release of Bifenthrin&#174;, making it more acceptable to the environment and public health. Termite damage resistance of EPU was analyzed by testing the polymer, along with various other polymers (HDPE, PP, PVC and Nylon), with Coptotermes acinaciformes and correlating the termite properties (mandibular force, hardness) with those of the polymeric materials (surface and tensile properties). EPU resisted termite damage, though its softer form incurred 5 times more material damage than the robust cast type. EPUs with high values of hardness incurred ~40% less damage than HDPE and were comparable with the damages on PP. The depth and width of termite damage on HDPE was 5 and 4 times, respectively, than that of PVC. This part of the study inferred that, although hardness of polymeric materials helps prevent termite damage, toughness and resilience too can make it difficult for termites to find a pathway through the material. XPS, FTIR, termite mortality bioassays in an applied setting and elusion tests of Bifenthrin&#174; from EPU in water, acetone and soil were employed to understand the interaction of EPU with Bifenthrin&#174;. Water and soil were chosen as test mediums due to their practical nature. These studies confirm that Bifenthrin&#174; at concentrations as low as 0.5 wt% enriches the surface of EPU due to preferential migration of CF3 group to the surface of EPU. Furthermore, Bifenthrin&#174; incorporated in EPU does not compromise its insecticidal activity and diffuses in a controlled manner at the rate of ~10&#8211;8 cm2 s&#8211;1 and ~10&#8211;7 cm2 s&#8211;1 when kept in water and soil media respectively. The durability of EPU/ Bifenthrin&#174; system was analyzed by conducting degradation studies on EPU. The effect of Bifenthrin&#174; on the ageing of EPU was also investigated. The studies involved ageing of the system in natural and accelerated conditions and validating the results by use of Arrhenius models. The sub-soil conditions do not degrade EPU beyond the oxidative levels as the activation energy required to cause changes in properties of EPU are unphysically small (0.02 kJ mol-1). It was found that EPU can sustain its physical integrity for 12 years at room temperature and Bifenthrin&#174; may remain in a 5 mm thick barrier material for up to 10 years. The effect of Bifenthrin&#174; on the tensile properties of EPU is negligible. Studies to analyze the performance of the barrier material, involved testing of timber coated with the EPU/ Bifenthrin&#174; system under real-life conditions against termites in field trials located at two tropical locations in Northern Queensland.

These habitats are in urgent need of efficient monitoring and management programs to sustain their biological, economic and cultural values for the global community. Habitats maps, describing the extent, composition and the condition of the benthos in time and space, form a valuable information source for scientists and managers to answer their management questions. Adequate and accurate habitat maps are needed and can be provided by a range of mapping approaches, which are based on integration of field and remotely sensed image data sets. Scientists, technicians and managers lack knowledge on the cost effectiveness and procedures for calibrating and validating mapping approaches that integratef field data and remote sensing imagery, for use in various coral reef and seagrass environments. This knowledge is required to adequately design, apply and assess operational mapping approaches and their maps. Hence, the aim of this study is to improve habitat mapping capabilities by integrating low cost remote sensing approaches and field-calibration and -validation methods for a range of coral reef and seagrass environments. To achieve this aim, commonly used habitat mapping approaches that integrated field-calibration and -validation methods with remote sensing image based processing techniques were studied, in different coral reef and seagrass environments in Fiji and Australia. These environments varied in: water clarity, water depth, benthic composition, spatial complexity of benthic features, and remoteness. The study had three objectives: (1) to evaluate the accuracy, cost and perceived relevance of eight commonly used benthic cover mapping approaches for three different coral reef environments. (2) Conduct a cost-benefit comparison of two field survey methods for calibrating and validating maps of coral reef benthos derived from high-spatial resolution satellite images in three different coral reef environments. (3) Identify considerations for comparing the thematic accuracy of multi-use image based habitat maps in various coral reef and seagrass environments. A scientific assessment and an evaluation of the relevance for managers, was conducted on eight commonly used habitat mapping approaches for three different coral reef environments. This analysis revealed a preference for a mapping approach based on supervised classification of Quickbird imagery integrated with basic field data. This approach produced an accurate map within a short time with low cost in that suited the user&#8217;s purpose. Additionally, the results indicated that user preference in selecting a suitable map was affected by: variations in environmental complexity; map purpose, and resource management requirements. To assess the variation in performance of methods for calibration and validation for coral reef benthic community maps, derived from high-spatial resolution satellite images, a comparison was conducted between spot check and georeferenced photo-transect based mapping approaches. The assessment found that the transect based method was a robust procedure which could be used in a range of coral reef environments to map the benthic communities accurately. In contrast, the spot check method is a fast and low cost approach suitable to map benthic communities which have lower spatial complexity. However, the spot check approach provides robust results, if it is applied in a standardised manner, providing a description of selected homogenous areas with georeferenced benthic cover photos. Considerations for comparing the thematic accuracy of multi-use image based habitat maps in various coral reef and seagrass environments were assessed. This included a review of 80 scientific publications on coral reef and seagrass habitat mapping, which revealed a lack of knowledge and reporting in regards to the assessment of the thematic map accuracy. These publications commonly used thematic accuracy measures and factors controlling their variation were then determined for various habitat mapping approaches for different coral reefs and seagrass environments. Assessment of these measures found that variations in accuracy levels were not only a result of actual differences in map accuracy, but were also due to: spatial complexity of benthic features present in the study area; distribution of the calibration and validation samples relative to each other, and the level of detail provided by these samples. Two main outcomes resulted from this dissertation. The first was the development of a robust mapping approach based on georeferenced photo-transect method integrated with high spatial resolution imagery, which is able to accurately map a variety of coral reef and seagrass habitats. The second outcome is an increase in capacity for coral reef and seagrass habitat mapping by scientists and managers. This increase is accomplished by providing knowledge on various habitat mapping approaches in regards to their: cost/time, accuracy and user relevance; performance of calibration and validation field methods; and performance of accuracy measures, when applied in a range of coral reef and seagrass environments. The findings and outcomes from this dissertation will significantly contribute to management of coral reef and seagrass environments by enabling scientists and managers to choose appropriate combinations of: field and image data sources; processing approaches, and validation methods for habitat mapping in these environments.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">05 Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">coral reefs</field><field name="subject">Seagrasses</field><field name="subject">Habitat Mapping</field><field name="subject">Supervised classification</field><field name="subject">remote sensing</field><field name="subject">calibration</field><field name="subject">validation</field><field name="subject">Cost Benefit Analysis</field><field name="subject">Quickbird</field><field name="subject">Management</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180029</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Asymmetric Dependence Structures</field><field name="creator">Anthony Hatherley</field><field name="description">Asymmetric dependence (AD) is defined as dependence that differs across opposing regions of the joint return distribution. Recent evidence of AD between equity returns suggests that dependence can be decomposed into a linear component, captured by the correlation matrix, and a higher order component. When these higher order terms are characterised by increased correlation in bear or bull markets, the effectiveness of diversification strategies is reduced. To the extent that an investor is unable to completely diversify these higher order terms of dependence, it follows that they should be reflected in asset prices and managed explicitly during the portfolio construction process. The aim of this thesis is to determine the extent of AD amongst asset returns, to investigate whether AD is priced and to develop a means of managing AD in the portfolio. I justify the existence of AD and the separation of AD from linear dependence via the bivariate Edgeworth expansion, finding that the joint return distribution may be described by an infinite number of higher order co-moments. Correlation (and hence &#946;) describes one dimension of an infinite number of higher dimensions describing dependence. To determine the importance of AD in finance, I first develop measures that can detect AD independent of the level of linear dependence and idiosyncratic risk. These measures are used to determine the extent of AD amongst US stock returns and the market, to obtain an understanding of how AD changes through time and to re-examine the evidence of AD between equity portfolios. By measuring AD separate from linear dependence, I demonstrate several findings. First, I find evidence of non-stationary AD that can exists irrespective of the magnitude of linear dependence, measured by &#946;. This time-varying AD consists of both significant upper tail dependence (UTD) and significant lower tail dependence (LTD), although LTD is found to occur more frequently than UTD, especially for small stocks and stocks displaying high idiosyncratic risk. Significant time-varying AD is also detected between domestic equity indices and international equity markets, implying that if a portfolio is weighted towards certain industries or countries, portfolio construction methods may need to be adjusted in order too meet risk and return targets, particularly if future AD cannot be adequately forecasted. Next, I investigate whether AD is priced in US equities using the Fama and MacBeth (1973) regression methodology in conjunction with my &#946; invariant AD metrics. I find that AD is as important as linear dependence in explaining the variation in returns. In particular, a positive relationship between LTD and return is found. I document an AD risk premium of 2.7% pa, compared to a &#946; risk premium of 6.18% pa. The AD risk premium increases to 6.9% pa for stocks with significant LTD. This result holds after controlling for size, book-to-market ratio, downside &#946; and coskewness. I also find past AD is a significant variable in predicting the future returns of small firms, whilst neither AD nor linear dependence predict the future returns of large firms. I subsequently demonstrate a means of incorporating AD structures during the portfolio construction process using copula functions. I then investigate how asymmetric return dependencies affect the efficient frontier and subsequent portfolio performance under a dynamic rebalancing framework. By considering the problem of tactically allocating a small set of domestic equity indices, I demonstrate several findings. First, I show that a Mean-Variance efficient frontier differs from the efficient frontier constructed under AD. Constructing paper portfolios based upon these differences, I find that real economic value lies in correctly accounting for AD structures. The primary source of this economic value stems from the ability to better protect portfolio value and reduce the size of any erosion in return relative to the normal portfolio. Finally, I document the benefits of actively managing AD during the portfolio construction process and determine a number of portfolio management principles required to successfully manage AD. I illustrate that managing asymmetry risk in a portfolio of international equity indices results in increased return, decreased risk and decreased transaction costs. I show that in order to yield these benefits, investors must actively and dynamically manage their portfolio. Furthermore, I illustrate that the ability to short-sell assets provides most of the benefits described.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">asymmetric dependence</field><field name="subject">correlation</field><field name="subject">asset pricing</field><field name="subject">portfolio theory</field><field name="subject">copula theory</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180083</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stochastic phase-space methods for lattice models</field><field name="creator">David Barry</field><field name="description">Grand-canonical inverse-temperature calculations of a single mode Bose-Hubbard model are presented, using the Gaussian phase space representation. Simulation of 100 particles is achieved in the ground state, having started with a low-particle-number thermal state. A preliminary foray into a three-mode lattice is made, but the sampling error appears to be too large for the simple approach taken here to be successful in larger systems. The quantum (real-time) dynamics of a one-dimensional Bose gas with two-particle losses are investigated. The Positive-P equations for this system are unstable, and this causes Positive-P simulations to `die' after a certain amount of time. Gauges are used to (sometimes partially) stabilise the equations. The effects on simulation times of various gauges, branching methods, and non-square diffusion matrix factorisations on simulation times are investigated. Despite the absence of repulsive inter-particle interactions, it is observed that $g^{(2)}$ rises above 1 at a finite particle separation. A phase space method for spin systems is introduced, based on SU(2) coherent states. This is essentially a spin analogue of the Positive-P method. The system of stochastic differential equations arising out of this method require weighted averages to be taken, and the weights can vary exponentially, leading to inefficient sampling. For the case of the Ising model, a transform is made to a set of equations which relaxes (in a dummy time variable) to the partition function at a given temperature, and allows unweighted ensemble averages to be taken. This allows accurate simulations to be achieved at a range of temperatures, with nearest-neighbour correlation functions agreeing with theory. This represents a proof of principle for the use of stochastic phase space methods in spin systems, and furthermore the method should be suited to open spin systems, at least for a small number of qubits.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">230000 Mathematical Sciences</field><field name="subject">bose gases</field><field name="subject">phase space</field><field name="subject">stochastic</field><field name="subject">ising</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180088</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women and Peacebuilding: A Feminist Study of Contemporary Bougainville</field><field name="creator">Barbara King</field><field name="description">This dissertation explores the relationship between peacebuilding, theory and praxis, and women. It examines the impact that peacebuilding has on women and the ways in which women participate in peacebuilding, both during conflicts and in the period of transformation that follows. In this dissertation I argue that women are profoundly affected by conflict and are crucial to peacebuilding and post-conflict transformation. This dissertation seeks to make a contribution to our understanding of how peacebuilding and post-conflict transformation impacts on women. The dissertation includes a study of Bougainville. The ten year civil war which began in 1989 ended in 1998 with a formal ceasefire and was followed by the Bougainville Peace Agreement in 2001. It was the role that women played throughout the conflict which has been widely cited in the literature that is of most interest to me. Bougainvillean women have been credited as being the motivating force behind the peace process during the war, in the lead up to the ceasefire and peace agreement, and an integral part of the post- conflict transformation of Bougainville. Many suggest that one explanation for this is because Bougainville is mostly a matrilineal society. Although some literature suggests matrilineality is restricted to lineage and land, this dissertation contends that matrilineality in Bougainville gave women substantive power and authority over most aspects of society. With some exceptions, the literature on peacebuilding is relatively recent, galvanized by Boutros Boutros-Ghali&#8217;s An Agenda for Peace (1992). A more historical body of literature postulates an enduring relationship between women and peace. These two bodies of literature provide the context for this dissertation. The literature that directly frames the argument of this dissertation is the feminist literature on women and peacebuilding. This literature proposes that the conflict and its aftermath are profoundly gendered phenomena. Birgitte Sorensen&#8217;s 1998 report, Women and Post-conflict Reconstruction: Issues and Sources, categorises peacebuilding into the areas of political, economic and social and critically examines the impacts of each of these areas of peacebuilding from the perspective of women. This report provides an excellent framework for this study. I use Sorensen&#8217;s model but have extended it to include a fourth category on postconflict justice to explore how issues related to women and justice are addressed. I do this because there are a number of issues related to women and post-conflict justice that need to be explored in greater detail, such as women&#8217;s access to land and gendered violence. This dissertation examines how each area of peacebuilding impacts on women, and how women and men participate in these areas of peacebuilding. This approach provides the structure of the dissertation. This dissertation concurs with the proposition that conflict and its aftermath are profoundly gendered. Even in the matrilineal society of Bougainville where women enjoy relatively high status, conflict has its disempowering effects on women. Peacebuilding adds new dimensions to the power of women and their disempowerment. In relation to political peacebuilding, there is an uneasy hybrid system of authority in Bougainville as the people of Bougainville attempt to retain some of their traditions in the newly constructed Western models of governance. The evidence is clear that women are under-represented in the introduced Western institutions. Over time, these institutions accumulate more of the power and authority. Within the economy, women are, as ever, the producers. In the past women&#8217;s ownership and control of land gave them control over the labour of men (in some parts of Bougainville), but the ending of the conflict has opened up new spaces for men to control land. Nihilistic spaces have emerged where once there was fighting. The shape of the new Bougainvillean economy is by no means clear, but there are disturbing signs that women will not be accorded their due as producers within society. Much of the feminist literature on peacebuilding points to the fact that women&#8217;s work in peacebuilding is unseen in mending the torn social fabric of post-conflict society. This dissertation confirms that hypothesis. This is where the women in Bougainville have managed to retain their traditional matrilineal strength as carers and healers of the social body. However they face new problems in relation to land and in relation to the escalation of domestic violence. They also face ongoing problems of how to heal and remedy the trauma of what was simultaneously a struggle for independence and a civil war. Matrilineality has protected Bougainvillean women from some of the traumas of war. The children of women raped during the conflict are welcomed into their matrilineal clan and women are able to exercise considerable authority within their communities. Nonetheless, it is a profoundly disturbing finding of this dissertation that peacebuilding in Bougainville may itself be setting boundaries around the power and authority of women in matrilineal Bougainville. Bougainvillean women may yet need to contend with men for their rightful place in the new society.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">360000 Policy and Political Science</field><field name="subject">women, peacebuilding, feminism, Bougainville, post-conflict</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180096</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aged Horse Health, Management and Welfare</field><field name="creator">Thomas Mcgowan</field><field name="description">Abstract Background: Aged horses make up an important portion of the equine industry in Australia but have not been the subjects of detailed research. Issues relating to aged horse health, management and welfare are still largely unknown. Horses live up to 40 years, but many are retired before reaching twenty years of age thus making a large discrepancy between productive verses unproductive life. Based principally on reviews of veterinary hospital records, there has been a reported increased occurrence and severity of a range of diseases in aged horses. The increased prevalence of disease, potential for reduced perceived value and lack of regular riding may contribute to reduction in the type and quality of management practices utilised in this population resulting in compromised welfare of aged horses. Aims: By way of an owner-based survey, the first aim was to examine the demographics of aged horses, their management, the prevalence of clinical signs of disease and owner reported health or welfare issues. Using a detailed veterinary clinical examination and appropriate laboratory tests, the second aim was to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of more common health disorders, prevention or management of these disorders and how diseases or other factors affect survival. Further, this study aimed to determine owners&#8217; opinions relating to euthanasia of aged horses and to correlate these opinions with the personalities of the owners themselves. Methods: Owners of horses aged 15 years and older were contacted via equestrian organisations in Queensland, Australia and asked to complete a questionnaire on key information about the horse (e.g. age, breed, sex, and colour), use, management strategies, use of equine health care providers, clinical signs that the horse may be demonstrating, known diseases that the horse may have experienced or be experiencing, and identify any health or welfare issues they believed were important for horses aged 15 years or greater. From this population, a subsample was selected with these horses subjected to a thorough clinical examination, dental and ocular examination and blood tests for routine haematology, serum biochemistry, ACTH, &#945;-MSH and insulin concentrations. Owners of the subsample of horses were asked to complete a questionnaire on their opinions of euthanasia of aged horses as well as complete a self assessment personality test. One to four years after the original survey, owners were contacted to gather additional information about the horses&#8217; survival/death and if death had occurred the events and causes related to it. Analysis: Data was managed in Microsoft Access and Excel. Descriptive, univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using SPSS, Minitab and Stata. Univariable and multivariable regression modelling and survival analysis were performed where appropriate. Results: Horses aged 15 years or greater in Queensland represented &#8531;rd of the total horses owned in the population. The median age of the horses was 20.7 years (IQ range 17-23, min 15, max 44). Owners were able to identify many clinical signs exhibited by their horses, with 83% of horses having at least one reported clinical sign of disease. But, many signs had apparently been overlooked, with only 35.2% of horses reported by the owners to have a known disease or disorder. Further, there was a large disparity between the prevalence of disease by owner reports compared to veterinary examination. For example, owner reported dental disease was 0.5% while moderate to severe dental disease occurred in 46% horses examined. Univariable and multivariable analysis identified many associations between disease and horse factors, management factors and clinical signs, with many diseases significantly related to increasing age. There was considerable variation in the level of owner reported professional and other health care strategies. In the preceding 12 months, 90% had received hoof care, 67% had received dental care, and 50% were vaccinated, while only 39% had received veterinary care. Despite this owners expressed concern about the health and welfare of their horses. The majority of owners, 91.6% (491/536), responded with at least one reply to a question about which they thought were the most important health issues in aged horses. Owners were most concerned about weight loss (maintaining the horse&#8217;s condition), arthritis/lameness and teeth and dental care. The major influences on the decision to euthanase involved animal welfare and quality of life and owners were cognizant and concerned about these factors relative to their horses. Of the 766 horses that were followed for survival, 13.2% had died. The median survival time was 777days. Age, breed of horse, region of residence, diagnosis of equine Cushing&#8217;s syndrome, being owned by Riding for the Disabled and reported history of difficulty eating were all significantly associated with decreased survival. Conclusions: This is the first major population study of aged horses in Australia. The aged horse population is a large sub population of the Australian horse population. This study has highlighted many aged related diseases and their specific risk factors. Owners demonstrated concern for the health and welfare of aged horses, but a lack of appropriate identification of many diseases by owners and limited veterinary care suggest a need for increased client communication and veterinarian-client interaction.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">Equine</field><field name="subject">equine management</field><field name="subject">equine epidemiology</field><field name="subject">equine health</field><field name="subject">equine welfare</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180103</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating Sex Specific Cell Cycle Regulation in Fetal Germ Cells</field><field name="creator">Cassy Spiller</field><field name="description">During development, somatic cell cues direct sex-specific differentiation of germ cells that is characterised by two distinct cell cycle states. At 12.5 days post coitum (dpc) in a testis, XY germ cells stop proliferating and enter G1/G0 arrest. In the ovary, XX germ cells bypass G1/G0 arrest and instead enter the first phase of meiosis I from 13.5 dpc. Whilst it is hypothesised that errors in cell cycle control during development precede the formation of testicular germ cell tumours, the mechanism of cell cycle control at this time has not been thoroughly investigated. This project therefore sought to explore the mechanism of XY germ cell G1/G0 arrest using several approaches. Although cell cycle regulation for somatic cells is well established, we know very little regarding germ cell control of this process. Therefore my first aim was to profile this machinery at the transcript level using a cell cycle cDNA array. Purified populations of germ cells were isolated both before and after sex differentiation and expression of 112 cell cycle related genes was assessed. From this study a comprehensive network governing apoptosis and calcium signalling that was common to both XX and XY germ cells was observed. Importantly, the retinoblastoma family and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21 was implicated in the regulation of G1/G0 arrest in XY germ cells. Lastly, XX germ cells displayed a down-regulation of genes involved in both G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle consistent with their progression past G1 phase. This study has provided a detailed analysis of cell cycle gene expression during fetal germ cell development and identified candidate factors for future investigation in order to understand cases of aberrant cell cycle control in these specialised cells. In order to investigate several candidate genes identified within the cell cycle array, I next sought to generate a germ cell-specific Cre recombinase mouse model for use in conditional knockout studies. As current Cre lines lack specificity or appropriate temporal expression, we used the germ cell-specific regions of the fragilis promoter to drive Cre expression during germ cell specification. Eleven founder lines were generated using this construct and four were analysed using a reporter line. Although we have not achieved germ cell expression from these lines to date, analysis continues in order to identify an invaluable new tool for germ cell research. Following the implication of the retinoblastoma family in XY germ cell G1/G0 arrest, I next investigated the role of RB in these cells using the Rb null mutant. RB is a known cell cycle suppressor that controls this process in many cell types and, subsequently, mice homozygous for the Rb deletion die in utero at 14.5 dpc. Using this model we analysed developing gonads from 14.5 &#8211; 16.5 dpc using ex vivo culture techniques. At 14.5 dpc when wild type germ cells have arrested, proliferating germ cells were detected in the absence of Rb using proliferation marker Ki67. This proliferation was accompanied by a slight increase in germ cell number at 14.5 dpc, however, two days later at 16.5 dpc germ cell numbers were slightly decreased in the Rb-/- testes. During this time we could also detect increased expression of other RB family members p107 and p130, suggesting that these factors may compensate for the loss of Rb in the germ line. This investigation has implicated RB in the regulation of XY germ cell G1/G0 arrest and will form the basis for future work aimed at understanding the initiation of this cell cycle state. In addition to RB, a lesser-known transcription factor was also investigated in the initiation and maintenance of XY germ cell G1/G0 arrest. The high mobility group box transcription factor 1 (HBP1) suppresses proliferation and promotes differentiation in various cell types and was recently identified within the XY germ cells at the appropriate time of sex differentiation. In my analysis two Hbp1 transcripts were identified within the XY germ cells that display different sub-cellular localisations in vitro. Next, Hbp1-LacZ reporter lines were generated to aid in understanding the germ cell-specific regulation of these transcripts and lastly, I analysed the genetrap mutation for Hbp1. Surprisingly, this model revealed no aberrations to germ cell-cell cycle control during development. In summary, I have performed the first comprehensive study of the cell cycle machinery utilised by germ cells as they undergo the first stages of sex differentiation. Using loss-of-function models I was able to implicate the cell cycle regulator RB specifically in XY germ cell G1/G0 arrest and, conversely, demonstrate that the transcription factor HBP1 is not required for this process.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fetal germ cell</field><field name="subject">cell cycle regulation</field><field name="subject">gonad</field><field name="subject">mitotic arrest</field><field name="subject">meiosis</field><field name="subject">testis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180111</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the relationships between stress, coping, benefit-finding and Quality of Life in Colorectal Cancer Survivors: A longitudinal study.</field><field name="creator">Machelle Rinaldis</field><field name="description">The primary aim of this thesis was to conduct a longitudinal study, to investigate the quality of life (QOL) in a large sample of people diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC), immediately post-diagnosis and one-year later. Various measures were utilised to capture the multifaceted concept of QOL, including psychological distress, satisfaction with life, positive affect and cancer-related quality of life. The investigation was conducted within Lazarus and Folkman&#8217;s stress and coping framework. Specifically, this research aimed to test the utility of the stress and coping framework in the context of CRC, and to explore the role of benefit-finding within the context of the stress and coping model components. One thousand, eight hundred participants (1078 men and 722 women) with a CRC diagnosis duration of 1 to 12 months, completed a telephone interview and written questionnaire, assessing demographics, disease/treatment characteristics, threat appraisal, social support, optimism, coping, benefit-finding and quality of life domains, at approximately five- and 12-months post-diagnosis. To identify CRC-specific coping strategies, the Coping with Colorectal Cancer measure was developed in the initial study. The eight factor structure was confirmed, and the subscales (Positive Perceptual Change; Religion/Spirituality; Rumination; Acceptance; Humour; Palliative; Seeking Social Support; and Lifestyle Reorganisation) found to have reliability and preliminary criterion-related validity within the context of the stress and coping framework. As predicted, regression analyses showed that, after controlling for demographics, disease/treatment characteristics and stress/coping variables, the coping subscales uniquely predicted Time 1 QOL outcomes, with Seeking Social Support continuing to predict Time 2 Positive Affect. In the second study, the benefit-finding domains specific to those with CRC were identified, and relationships with quality of life outcomes assessed, to determine the inclusion of benefit-finding in the path model. Based on completed data from 1757 of the initial 1800 participants, confirmatory factor analyses revealed three domains of benefit-finding: Personal Growth; Interpersonal Growth and Acceptance. As hypothesised, regressions analyses found that benefit-finding domains at Time 1 was associated with Time 1 QOL outcomes, specifically, Positive Affect and Cancer-related Quality of Life (both the aggregate score and its Social/Family, Functional and Colorectal Cancer-specific Well-being subscales). Time 1 Personal Growth also predicted Time 1 Psychological Distress. After controlling for Time 1 Positive Affect, Personal Growth continued to predict Time 2 Positive Affect. The final study drew on the results of the first two studies, which informed the coping strategies and benefit-finding domains to be included in regression analyses initially, and then, structural equation modelling. The final study included 1276 complete data sets of the initial 1800 participants. Parameters of the initial hypothesised model of the stress and coping framework, including relationships with benefit-finding (based on empirical findings) failed to fit the model to the data. After several revisions, the analysis revealed that the final model fit the data, where stress, coping and benefit-finding accounted for 63% of the variance in Time 1 QOL. The model showed that threat appraisal, coping resources, avoidant coping and benefit-finding directly impacted on Time 1 QOL, while threat appraisal, social support and approach coping directly impacted on benefit-finding. In this study, the approach coping strategies included in the path model could also be conceptualised as meaning-based coping strategies, as they appeared to facilitate a meaning-making process. However, benefit-finding, which some researchers have suggested is also a meaning-based coping strategy, had differential relationships with stress, coping and outcome variables, compared with the approach coping strategies. These results indicate that benefit-finding is an empirically distinct construct in the context of CRC. Finally, in this study, the impact of stress, coping and benefit-finding on Time 2 QOL, was indirect, being mediated by Time 1 QOL outcomes. The accumulated findings of these three studies have extended the cancer coping and benefit-finding research by revealing new relations between stress, coping and benefit-finding and QOL in a mixed-gender, older population with CRC. There are implications for measurement of, and theory building around benefit-finding. Finally, these studies inform the development of clinical interventions to enhance the quality of life in the short- and longer-term for individuals diagnosed with CRC.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">benefit-finding, stress and coping, colorectal cancer, quality of life</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180115</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#8220;What&#8217;s in it for me?&#8221; Employee Knowledge Sharing on Knowledge Management Systems: Normative and Social Exchange Perspectives</field><field name="creator">Scott Krebs</field><field name="description">Capturing and sharing individual and organisational knowledge is vital for organisational functioning. Knowledge management systems (KMS) are information technology systems which enable employees to electronically capture and distribute knowledge across the organisation. Because knowledge sharing is often a discretionary behaviour requiring time and energy on behalf of employees, the success of KMS largely relies on their motivation and willingness to share. KMS implemented within organisations have been largely ineffective with failure rates of 80% documented in the knowledge management literature. There is a need for further understanding of the barriers and facilitators for employee contributions to KMS. In particular, there is a dearth of empirical research examining the role of social and organisational factors in knowledge sharing on KMS. To this end, a programme of research was developed which utilised normative and social exchange perspectives to explain employee knowledge sharing on KMS. A combination of research methodologies were employed across five field-based studies. The aim of Study 1 was to identify the determinants of knowledge sharing on KMS. In Study 1, qualitative data were collected through 16 in-depth interviews with employees from a medium-sized private sector organisation. While several barriers and facilitators were identified, the most prevalent themes to emerge from the content analysis were perceived benefits and management support, highlighting the central role of social exchange and normative processes in explaining employee knowledge sharing on KMS. The results of Study 1 were used in conjunction with previous research to design the subsequent quantitative studies. Study 2 examined the mediating role of perceived benefits in the management support &#8211; knowledge sharing intentions relationship. It used a cross-sectional survey design and sampled 41 employees from a large private sector organisation. Three main findings emerged. First, management support was positively related to employees&#8217; knowledge sharing intentions. Second, perceived benefits were positively related to employees&#8217; knowledge sharing intentions. Third, perceived individual benefits mediated the relationship between management support and knowledge sharing intentions. Study 3 examined the moderating role of perceived organisational support (POS) in the management support &#8211; knowledge sharing intentions relationship. Study 2 and 3 were both quantitative studies taken from the same organisational setting but with different user groups. In Study 2, the users directly contributed their knowledge onto the system. In Study 3 (N = 45), the users shared their knowledge through an intermediary person. Study 3 further extended Study 2 by investigating knowledge sharing behaviour (N = 27) in addition to knowledge sharing intentions. Study 3 had three key findings. First, consistent with Study 2, management support was positively related to employees&#8217; knowledge sharing intentions. Second, POS was positively related to employees&#8217; knowledge sharing intentions and knowledge sharing behaviour. Third, POS moderated the relationship between management support and knowledge sharing behaviour. Study 4 replicated and extended the findings of the previous studies in a different organisational setting. Two separate studies were conducted in a medium-sized public sector organisation. In Study 4a (N = 295) data were collected at a single point in time. Study 4b (N = 246) extended the previous quantitative studies by examining two forms of management support for the KMS as well as collecting self-reported behavioural data (N= 130) at a second time period. Overall, the findings of these studies provided mixed support for the predictions. First, system-related management support, organisational identification, perceived individual benefit and perceived organisational benefit were directly related to employee knowledge sharing on KMS. However, contrary to prediction, POS was not found to be directly related to employee knowledge sharing across the two studies. Second, organisational identification was found to moderate the relationship between management support and knowledge sharing in Study 4a but not 4b. Third, POS moderated the relationship between management support and knowledge sharing in Study 4b, however, no such relationship was found in Study 4a. Finally, across the two studies, both perceived individual and organisational benefit were found to uniquely mediate the relationship between management support and knowledge sharing intentions. On the basis of the findings of the research programme, several conclusions were made. First, system-related support from management is an important determinant of employee knowledge sharing on KMS. Second, employees&#8217; perception of the benefits derived from knowledge sharing has an important influence on their contributions to KMS. Third, the extent to which employees identify with the organisation influences their decision to share knowledge on KMS. Fourth, the extent to which employees perceive support from the organisation influences their decision to share knowledge on KMS.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knowledge Sharing, Social Exchange, Norms, Knowledge Management Systems</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180142</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding the emergence, diffusion and continuance of intercountry adoption from South Korea to Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Patricia Fronek</field><field name="description">The adoption of Korean children has played a significant role in the practice of intercountry adoption in Australia since the 1970s and represents the majority of overseas born children adopted into Australia. Its influence on policy and practice is explored in this thesis through the Queensland experience. From its outset the adoption of children from overseas has been characterised by polarised perspectives and vested interests. Actor Network Theory, the theoretical lens through which this phenomenon is viewed, allows for the exploration of controversies and multiple perspectives that have featured in over thirty years of Korean intercountry adoption practice in Australia. This thesis aims to identify which actor networks were influential in the emergence, diffusion and continuation of Korean intercountry adoption; and to explore the translations, an important concept in Actor Network Theory, and the tactics used by these networks to spread particular discourse to meet network goals. The methodology is qualitative and approaches Korean intercountry adoption as a case study. The data corpus, collected from 2004 to 2007 comprised text and interviews. Text included Queensland government archival records; submissions provided to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Human Services Overseas Adoption in Australia 2005 and public hearing transcripts; parliamentary documents; media reports; computer-mediated communications such as internet sources and email discussion groups. Interviews were conducted with key stakeholders from interest groups and organisations with administrative roles in intercountry adoption practice in Australia. Korean intercountry adoption has proved influential in developing expectations concerning how intercountry adoption should be practised in Australia. Three actor networks, proponent, opponent and nonpartisan were identified during the diffusion and continuance periods. Actor Network Theory helped understand how the proponent network became dominant in the Australian context. A number of highly effective tactics have been used to expand and increase the influence of the proponent network through translations. However, a number of threats to continuation such as the growth of the opponent network and the promotion of Korean domestic adoption have emerged. Actors have responded to these threats in a number of ways. Detours have been proposed by proponent actors to help them reach their goals though these may bring unintended consequences. An Actor Network Theory perspective reveals the important role of the Internet; helps understand how controversies are created and perpetuated; how intercountry adoption has become politicised in Australia; and highlights the risks to child centred and knowledge based practice that politicisation brings. The significance of this study lies in the insights provided by exploring power interrelationships between actor networks and how these shape particular phenomenon, in this case, Korean intercountry adoption. Intercountry adoption in Australia is poorly understood at a macro level as are the controversies surrounding it. Its practice has been heavily influenced by the interests of the dominant network with scant attention to research in the local context. Actor Network Theory that allows for the inclusion of human and nonhuman actors such as the Internet has proven useful for developing contemporary understandings of such a complex, global phenomenon. These understandings provide opportunities for individuals, groups and governments to address controversy in ways than do not contribute to its perpetuation and to refocus their attentions on the factors that contribute to the relinquishment of children in the first instance. This thesis highlights how politically driven agendas that serve the interests of one network can marginalise voices that bring more complex understandings to the intercountry adoption phenomenon. An Actor Network Theory analysis exposes the lack of investment by governments, organisations and individuals in community programs and services that address the causes of child relinquishment and empower Korean families and communities to seek their own solutions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intercountry Adoption</field><field name="subject">South Korea</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Actor Network Theory</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180158</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CONSUMER EVALUATIONS OF SPONSOR BRAND ASSOCIATIONS</field><field name="creator">Pi-Hsuan Monica Chien</field><field name="description">Corporate sponsorships have received increased attention from brand managers and academics in recent years. While researchers agree that sponsorship aids in generating favourable images for the sponsor, both at the corporate and brand levels, a lack of theory-guided models has prevented investigation into more complex phenomena. Current understanding of sponsorship effects is largely confined to the single sponsorship context with dominant emphasis on sponsorship awareness. The challenge surrounding sponsorship image measurement is only heightened by the increase in sponsorship activities. A growing number of brands are becoming associated with multiple events or entities. The purpose of the present research is to understand the mechanisms that underlie consumer processing of a brand&#8217;s sponsorship portfolio to affect inferences about sponsor brand associations, and in particular brand personality, brand meaning and brand attitude. The present research consolidates a range of conceptual and theory-guided models used by previous researchers, and adds to sponsorship literature by outlining how an accessibility based model can be applied to explain the cognitive processes involved when consumers encounter a brand&#8217;s sponsorships sequentially. In the context of a sponsorship portfolio, the associative network memory theory, congruence theory, and accessibility-diagnosticity theory are considered collectively and integrated into a conceptual framework to guide the development of hypotheses. The general theory proposed here is that accessibility of a sponsorship episode determines whether it will be used in subsequent information processing and percolate through to sponsor evaluations. A three-experiment research program is developed to explore the dynamics behind the portfolio effects. Pretests are conducted to identify brands and sponsorship properties that conform to the experimental manipulations but also to control for extraneous variables. Experiment 1 is designed to investigate the impact of perceived sponsorship portfolio fit on sponsor brand associations, and to determine how consumers assess portfolio fit. The experiment employs a 2 (sponsorship category relatedness: related vs. unrelated) x 2 (event personality fit: high fit vs. low fit) x 2 (sponsor product category: apparel vs. watch) between-subjects factorial design. Results point to sponsorship category relatedness as an important reference point in the evaluation of portfolio fit because it pulls sponsorships together when event personality fit is low, showing the predominance of category-based mode of processing. The role of event personality fit emerges when sponsorships lack categorical relatedness, leading to piecemeal-mode processing. Its influence of event personality fit is largely mute when sponsorships are categorically related, possibly because the individual event concepts are overwhelmed by a superordinate categorical imagery. Experiment 2 is designed to (1) allow replication of the portfolio effects with an additional sponsor product and different sets of sponsorship portfolios, and (2) investigate how individuals respond to a sponsorship portfolio which contains sponsorship properties with conflicting categories and personalities. Specifically, Experiment 2 aims to determine whether one sponsorship &#8220;frames&#8221; the processing of another sponsorship in a portfolio, and if so, determines the direction of framing. The experiment employs a 2 (sponsorship presentation sequence: sports first vs. cause first) x 2 (visual cues: present vs. absent) x 3 (sponsor product replicates: apparel vs. watch vs. juice) mixed factorial design. Two key findings emerge from this experiment. First, inferences about the sponsor brands&#8217; personalities are made in an additive fashion by augmenting event personalities, conforming to the &#8220;entitativity&#8221; principle. Second, when a sports sponsorship (rather than a cause sponsorship) is presented first in a portfolio, conceptual fluency is enhanced. This is because the sequence of processing is consistent with the way that people naturally think, thus leading to greater processing fluency. Experiment 3 is developed to further test the sponsorship framing effect and to explore the role of articulation in forging a relationship for ostensibly unrelated sponsorships. The experiment uses a 2 (sponsorship frame: sports frame vs. cause frame) x 2 (articulation: present vs. absent) between-subjects factorial design, plus a replicate and two control groups. Results replicate the findings of previous experiment where inferences for the sponsor brand personality are determined in an additive fashion. The findings also provide insights into when and whether using articulation in sponsorship communications can be beneficial. While articulating the relationship between sponsorships increases the perceived brand meaning consistency and clarity, a boomerang effect on brand attitude is observed, possibly because the commercially oriented content attributes a sales-oriented motive to the sponsor, which in turn, leads to a less favourable brand attitude. Theoretically, this research adds to current understanding of consumer-focused sponsorship processing by moving beyond simple pairing of sponsor and event, to consider the relationship between sponsorship properties. Through the integration of accessibility-diagnosticity theory, this research demonstrates that the way sponsorships influence brand evaluations is likely to be more complex than suggested by the existing literature and contributes to the development of methods to measure image transfer process. Practically, this research assists managers who are interested in the formulation of sponsorship policy and strategic design of sponsorship portfolios. The conceptual model developed in this thesis offers useful guidelines in providing input into the decision-making process when considering whether sponsorships could be used as brand building tools.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sponsorship, brand associations, marketing, consumer</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180166</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accidental Authors &#8211; Students experiment with making writing explicit during their Research Higher Degree</field><field name="creator">Naomi Anastasi</field><field name="description">The implicit position of writing during Research Higher Degree (RHD) candidature shapes how students in science approach the task of writing their theses. The dedication of universities to the principles of research has pushed writing to the fringes of the research higher degree. When writing is pushed to the fringes, it is rarely taught explicitly as an integral part of the postgraduate program. This research has found that students who are concerned with writing a thesis often require writing to be discussed explicitly during their education. In response to the absence of explicit instruction on writing, students turn to the principles of research to discover how to write their theses. However, students find that writing belongs to a different epistemological tradition than scientific research. This investigation found that as students realise that research is different from writing, they often write their theses by mimicking the work of other published authors in the same field. These findings emerge from eight semi&#8211;structured interviews with linguistically homologous students from a science faculty at a research-intensive university in Australia. These interviews show that students are initiating their own writing groups to learn more about writing. This research presents a case study which culminates in recommendations about how to re-position writing as an explicit discourse requiring attention during the research higher degree. These writing recommendations are developed in this research by analysing the principles of writing programs, examining the literature on writing groups, and reflecting the experience of students during the research higher degree.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">420000 Language and Culture</field><field name="subject">Writing, research higher degree, students, supervision, writing groups.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183517</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of the Board in Firm Strategy: A Strategy as Practice View</field><field name="creator">Kevin Hendry</field><field name="description">In this thesis I investigate how boards of directors strategize, how they manage strategy and how context affects this role. The significance of this research is underscored by three points. First, while there is an extensive body of literature on the board&#8217;s role in strategy, our understanding of how boards address this role, particularly how boards interact with management on strategy, is limited. Second, there is an implicit, albeit largely unproven, assumption in the literature that board involvement in strategy leads to more effective organizational performance. Third, there is a significant concern, especially from a practitioner perspective, that boards are overly focused on aspects of compliance at the expense of strategy and hence, underemphasize their role in driving firm performance. I begin with a review of the relevant literature on the strategy role of boards, using this literature to inform and reframe the broad research question that initiated this thesis &#8211; how do boards of directors contribute to strategy? In synthesizing this literature, I argue that it has not adequately addressed actual board behaviour in strategy and the impact of context on this behaviour. With this argument in mind, I frame board involvement in strategy from a Strategy as Practice perspective. I define board level strategizing as the situated (context dependent), socially accomplished flow of activities that characterizes how boards manage strategy, alternatively expressed as how boards &#8216;do&#8217; strategy. I use this Strategy as Practice perspective to reframe and refine the original research question. I follow the literature review with a discussion of the philosophical and methodological basis for this thesis, outlining an exploratory research program focused primarily on qualitative inquiry and supported by quantitative inquiry. In the qualitative stage I follow an inductive process that involves the pragmatic use of Grounded Theory Method. My specific objective is to develop a rich understanding of the practices that characterize board level strategizing and how these practices are affected by contextual aspects of the firm&#8217;s internal and external environments. I draw on pre-existing ideas from the Strategy as Practice literature on corporate level strategizing practices &#8211; Procedural and Interactive Strategizing &#8211; and use these as the starting point for an investigation into the strategizing practices of boards of directors. This stage involves in-depth, semi-structured interviews with all directors and senior managers (47 in total) in six purposively chosen organizations. It also involves in-depth interviews with another 17 senior managers in 15 different organizations. viii In the quantitative stage I rely on survey research. My specific objectives are to both simplify and enhance the understanding of board level strategizing developed in the qualitative stage. In simplifying understanding I aim to develop concise constructs that adequately capture board level strategizing; in enhancing understanding I aim to develop multiple item indicators for each construct that address its complexity. This stage involves three phases: a pre-test, a pilot survey in one Australian state and a national survey. In operationalizing constructs, I integrate key points from the literature with the detailed description of board level strategizing that emerges from the qualitative stage. Data analysis involves the use of Exploratory Factor Analysis in the Pilot study and Confirmatory Factor Analysis in the National study. The qualitative findings indicate that boards engage in a context specific balance between Procedural and Interactive Strategizing. The former involves an administrative, formalized and hierarchical focus while the latter involves an interpretative and reciprocal focus, one that emphasizes face-to-face interaction between directors and management. While Procedural Strategizing involves the board responding to management&#8217;s interpretation of strategy, Interactive Strategizing involves each group arguing for their own interpretations of strategy before reaching collective agreement based on these interpretations. The qualitative findings also indicate that Procedural and Interactive Strategizing are opposite but complementary practices and that the balance between these practices is affected by the interaction between three contextual aspects: (1) the strategic stance of the board; (2) board power relative to management; and (3) the perceived legitimacy of each practice on the part of the organizational actors involved. In elaborating this balance between Procedural and Interactive Strategizing I develop a new theoretical perspective to describe board involvement in strategy. The quantitative findings identify the specific micro-activities that comprise Procedural and Interactive Strategizing. I argue that this thesis makes three significant and interrelated contributions to knowledge. First, it develops a board specific strategizing framework and language, one that advances current concepts in the literature. Second, it represents the initial steps in developing an explanatory theory of board strategizing, one that focuses on the underlying, context specific, practices that constitute boards &#8216;doing&#8217; strategy. Third, it develops a preliminary scale to measure this strategizing behaviour. Finally, I discuss the implications of this thesis for further research and for practice.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">15 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="subject">Strategy, boards, directors, governance, strategizing, practice, behaviour, context.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183689</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the Edge: The Border Sanctuaries of Attica and Athenian Territoriality</field><field name="creator">Rashna Taraporewalla</field><field name="description">The principal sanctuaries of Attica outside the asty were situated in strategically important positions at the territorial limits of Athens. It will be argued that the sanctuaries placed on the frontiers of Attica were important nodes in the social construction, expression and implementation of Athenian territoriality. Sanctuaries which accommodated polis-level cults outside the urban centre provided the Athenians with a highly visible means of demarcating and communicating the extent of their territorial sovereignty. These religious sites developed in a visually conspicuous manner at a time when the territorial and social boundaries between the Athenians and neighbouring communities were crystallising. From an early stage in the development of the sanctuary sites of Attica, they played an instrumental role in defining the extent of Athenian territory, a space imbued with meaning in terms of claims of sovereignty and membership within the Athenian community. During the Archaic period, the border sanctuaries of Attica and the cults which they accommodated were elaborated, augmenting Athenian claims to contested borderlands and enhancing the prestige of the polis. The relative ranking and status of Athens in her interpolis relations was thereby enhanced, allowing the Athenians to reduce the threat of invasion of the chora. Following the Persian Wars, the sanctuaries continued to disseminate messages of the power and status of Athens, now hegemon of the Delian League. The structures and rites of the border sanctuaries reified the hegemonic power of Athens. When, during the long and bitter conflict of the Peloponnesian War, it became necessary to control the points of access into Athenian territory along the coastline, Rhamnous and Sounion were fortified. In the Late Classical period, the military role of a number of these sanctuaries was institutionalised. Fortification walls were augmented and refurbished and ephebic involvement in rites and festivals attested the close connection between religious and military activity.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Border sanctuaries</field><field name="subject">Attica</field><field name="subject">Athenian polis</field><field name="subject">Defence</field><field name="subject">Frontiers</field><field name="subject">Boundaries</field><field name="subject">Territoriality</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183725</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Light Scattering in Complex Mesoscale Systems: Modelling Optical Trapping and Micromachines</field><field name="creator">Vincent Loke</field><field name="description">Optical tweezers using highly focussed laser beams can be used to exert forces and torques and thus drive micromachines. This opens up a new field of microengineering, whose potential has yet to be fully realized. Until now, methods that have been used for modelling optical tweezers are limited to scatterers that are homogeneous or that have simple geometry. To aid in designing more general micromachines, I developed and implemented two main methods for modelling the micromachines that we use. These methods can be used for further proposed structures to be fabricated. The first is a FDFD/T-matrix hybrid method that incorporates the finite difference frequency domain (FDFD) method, which is used for inhomogeneous and anisotropic media, with vector spherical wave functions (VSWF) to formulate the T-matrix. The T-matrix is then used to calculate the torque of the trapped vaterite sphere, which is apparently composed of birefringent unit crystals but the bulk structure appears to be arranged in a sheaf-of-wheat fashion. The second method is formulating the T-matrix via discrete dipole approximation (DDA) of complex arbitrarily shaped mesoscale objects and implementing symmetry optimizations to allow calculations to be performed on high-end desktop PCs that are otherwise impractical due to memory requirements and calculation time. This method was applied to modelling microrotors. The T-matrix represents the scattering properties of an object for a given wavelength. Once it is calculated, subsequent calculations with different illumination conditions can be performed rapidly. This thesis also deals with studies of other light scattering phenomena including the modelling of scattered fields from protein molecules subsequently used to model FRET resonance, determining the limits of trappability, interferometric Brownian motion and the comparison between integral transforms by direct numerical integration and overdetermined point-matching.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">01 Mathematical Sciences</field><field name="subject">Light scattering</field><field name="subject">computational modelling</field><field name="subject">mesoscale</field><field name="subject">optical trapping</field><field name="subject">optical tweezers</field><field name="subject">micromachines</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183726</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Response of Helicoverpa armigera to agricultural environments diversified through companion planting.</field><field name="creator">Renee Herde</field><field name="description">This study investigated the potential of companion planting as a strategy to aid in the management of Helicoverpa armigera in tomato and capsicum cropping systems. The investigaitons showed that a companion planting type system is unlikely to confer any benefits to the management of H. armigera in these crops. The project has contributed to the understanding of H. armigera host selection and how the pest responds to a diversified environment. Companion planting and vegetational diversity are strategies for reducing pest incidence on crops. Many theories have been devised to explain how introducing more than one plant species to a cropping space may reduce the incidence of a pest. Five ecological theories formed the basis of experiments in this study: The resource concentration hypothesis - Herbivores are more likely to find and remain on hosts that are growing in dense or nearly pure stands (Root, 1973). Associational resistance/Plant apparency - Crop plants grown as monocultures are more apparent to herbivorous insects than plants in diverse natural systems (Tahvanainen and Root, 1972). Trap cropping &#8211; the use of plants within a cropping area to attract oviposition away from the main crop (Banks and Ekbom, 1999). The ability of H. armigera to learn in regard to host seleciton (Cunningham et al., 1998a). The natural enemies hypothesis - generalist and specialist natural enemies are expected to be more abundant in diverse rather than simple systems (Root, 1973) A tall variety of sorghum (the forage variety Chopper) was tested for its ability to disrupt host location. Sorghum was planted around plots of tomatoes to act as a screen to disrupt visual cues for host location by Helicoverpa spp. No difference was found in egg numbers on tomatoes with or without sorghum companions. However, significantly higher numbers of Helicoverpa spp. larvae were found in the sorghum at flowering than in the tomatoes. This suggested the sorghum was acting as a trap crop, diverting oviposition away from the tomato crop. However, due to a short period of flowering and therefore peak attractiveness to H. armigera, sorghum was not considered to be a suitable companion plant for inclusion in commercial tomato production systems. A host preference study was conducted to determine the preferences of H. armigera for crop plants and possible companions in the hope of finding a suitable trap crop species. Tomatoes were shown to be a highly preferred plant making it difficult to find a compatible trap crop species that would be more attractive than the main crop. However, capsicums were less prefered and therefore more suitable for this type of experimentation. Marigolds were also found to be a highly preferred plant and formed the basis for further investigations into trap cropping systems. Field experiments were conducted in successive years in two geographical locations to assess the suitability of marigolds as a trap crop for capsicums in a field situation. However, in both years H. armigera incidence was extremely and unusually low leading to inconclusive results. A glasshouse experiment was performed to assess if the ratio of capsicum plants to marigolds plants had an effect on which species H. armigera would choose for oviposition. It was found that as more capsicum plants were introduced, moths became less likely to oviposit on the supposedly more preferred marigold plant. The diminishing attractiveness of a more preferred host in the presence of other hosts is a new observation of H. armigera behaviour. This result suggests that marigolds would be unlikely to be a successful trap crop in a field situation. The ability of H. armigera to learn in regard to host selection and the influence of this on host selection in the field was investigated. No evidence of learning was found. This was the first study investigating the effect of learning in a field situation; previously the behaviour had only been investigated in a laboratory situation (Cunningham, et al. 1998a). The ability of the Australian assassin bug, Pristhesancus plagipennis (Walker) (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) to predate H. armigera larvae on capsicum plants was investigated. This predator has been sucessfully been used for H. armigera management in cotton (Grundy, 2000b), but had not been investigated in horticultural crops. Significant reductions in larvae were achieved in treatments where assassin bugs were introduced. This predator warrants further investigation for inclusion in commercial integrated pest managment programs for capsicums. Pest repellent plants were also considered. Previous to this study, very little research work had been conducted on repellent plants for H. armigera. The herbs investigated were catnip (Nepta cataria), tansy (Tanacetum vulgare), basil (Ocium basilicum) and coriander (Coriander sativum). An olfactometer system was designed and built to test H. armigera moths&#8217; responses to odours from the herbs. Glasshouse experiments were also conducted. No repellent activity was recorded with any of the herbs tested. The results of this study support the theory that Helicoverpa spp. employ a strategy of passive host selection as suggested by Firempong (1986). This means that all available plants in an area may be oviposited on with successful ovipostion and larval development leading to the future utilisation of a species as a host plant. The implication of this finding is that in-field trap cropping is unlikely to be a successful strategy for reducing H. armigera oviposition in tomato or capsicum production systems in Australia. In cotton crops in Australia, trap cropping is used as part of an area wide management strategy and aims to reduce the total Helicoverpa spp. population of a region. Such a strategy may also be successful in horticultural crops but only with the full participation of the growers of all crops that are attractive to H. armigera in a horticultural growing region. Due to the diverse nature of horticultural production this may be a difficult task.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">Helicoverpa armigera, companion planting, trap cropping, learning, marigold, host selection, repellent plants, Pristhesancus plagipennis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183732</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Insights into Diffusion-Controlled Bimolecular Termination using &#8216;Controlled/Living&#8217; Radical Polymerisation</field><field name="creator">Geoffrey Johnston-hall</field><field name="description">Free-radical polymerisation (FRP) has been one of the most important techniques for producing materials used in a very wide variety of applications and has enhanced the lives of millions of people around the world. However, for many years a number of fundamental questions regarding the key kinetic processes involved in FRP have remained unresolved. In particular, an accurate description of the mechanism for diffusion-controlled bimolecular termination has proven elusive. As a result, conventional modelling tools for FRP have often proven unreliable. The aim of this thesis, therefore, was to accurately study the evolution of the bimolecular termination rate coefficient during free radical polymerisation using a new and more accurate methodology based on &#8216;controlled/living&#8217; reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerisation. This was undertaken in order to develop a more precise understanding of bimolecular termination and thereby develop a more reliable modeling approach capable of predicting the rates of reaction and evolution of molecular weight distributions for a wide range of experimental conditions and a wide range of functional monomers. The RAFT-CLD-T (RAFT Chain-Length-Dependent Termination) Method was used to determine accurate values for the conversion and chain-length-dependent termination rate coefficient, kti,i(x), as a function of various parameters. These parameters included the chain size, i, polymer concentration (or conversion, x), chain length size distribution and chain architecture/structure. The accuracy of the RAFT-CLD-T Method was crucial to this work, therefore, an important part of this thesis was devoted to evaluating the reliability of this technique. Below 5 % conversion and above 80 % conversion the method was found to be unreliable due to the effects of chain-length-dependent propagation, high PDI&#8217;s and short-long termination. However, between 5 % and 80 % conversion it was found that the method is extremely robust and a series of easy-to-use experimental guidelines were determined for accurately applying the RAFT-CLD-T Method. The effects of chain size, chain size distribution, solution polymer concentration, and matrix architecture were examined for the RAFT-mediated polymerisations of methyl methacrylate (MMA), styrene (STY) and methyl acrylate (MA). It was found that four distinct scaling regimes of termination are observed: (1) a &#8216;short&#8217; chain dilute solution regime, (2) a &#8216;long&#8217; chain dilute solution regime, (3) a semi-dilute solution regime and (4) a concentrated solution regime. In dilute polymer solutions, chain-length-dependent power law exponents, &#61537;&#8217;s, determined during the polymerisation of MMA, STY and MA (where kti,i(x) &#61621; i-&#61537;) indicated that termination follows two major scaling regimes with exponents of approximately ~0.5 to 0.6 for &#8216;short&#8217; chains and and ~0.12 to 0.16 for &#8216;long&#8217; chains. Importantly, these exponents are in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions for translational and segmental diffusion-controlled termination, respectively. At increasing polymer concentrations, kti,i(x) falls rapidly coinciding with the onset of the gel effect. By comparing results from the RAFT-mediated polymerisations of MMA, STY, MA, and vinyl acetate (VAc) with theoretical models, we found that the onset of the gel effect coincided closely with the theoretical onset of chain overlap. Considerable uncertainty has plagued the evaluation of this phenomenon, but using a difunctional RAFT agent we showed this uncertainty arises from the influence of broad MWD&#8217;s on chain overlap and short-long termination. Finally, critical tests of this theory involving the bimolecular termination of linear radicals in solutions of star polymer confirmed that the gel effect coincided with chain overlap. Beyond the gel effect termination slows enormously, passing through the &#8216;semi-dilute solution&#8217; regime and into the &#8216;concentrated solution&#8217;. In semi-dilute solution, theoretical predictions based on scaling theory (i.e. the &#8216;blob&#8217; model) were in excellent agreement with results for the polymerisation of PSTY in linear and star polymer solutions, indicating that the solvent quality diminished both with increasing chain length and through the addition of a star polymer matrix. In concentrated solutions, the chain-length-dependent power law exponent increased linearly with conversion. For example, for MMA the chain length dependence of kt in the gel regime scaled as &#61537;gel = 1.8x + 0.056, suggesting that reptation alone does not describe termination in the concentrated solution. Values of &#61537;gel for PSTY, MA, and VAc were in similar agreement, indicating that a mechanism intermediate between unentangled and entangled semi-dilute scaling laws applies in the concentrated solution regime. Interestingly, &#61537;gel values for these monomers were found to decrease with increasing chain flexibility in the order &#61537;gel(MMA)&gt; &#61537;gel(STY)&gt; &#61537;gel(VAc)&gt; &#61537;gel(MA), suggesting matrix mobility is rate determining in concentrated solutions. Similarly, &#61537;gel values were also larger in star polymer solutions, coinciding with decreasing matrix mobility. Thus, although it has been commonly believed that polymer chains diffuse via reptation above the gel effect, these results show that this only occurs for solutions containing rigid and/or highly immobile macromolecules and in very high concentrations. To describe these behaviours, a semi-empirical &#8216;composite kt model&#8217; was also developed to describe kti,i(x) as a function of i and x up to high conversions. We showed that the model is very simple to implement and accurate for modelling a wide range of functional monomers and experimental conditions. In particular, we showed the method was accurate for modelling RAFT-mediated polymerisations of a very wide range of monomers (MA, MMA, and PSTY) and was even accurate for modelling conventional FRP&#8217;s. Thus, the model provides a simple, flexible and accurate method for predicting the rate of reaction and evolution of molecular weight distributions across a range of experimental conditions based on accurate kti,i(x) values.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Radical Reactions</field><field name="subject">Kinetics</field><field name="subject">Diffusion</field><field name="subject">Bimolecular Termination</field><field name="subject">Reversible Addition-Fragmentation Chain Transfer</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of a targeted exercise program on function, activity and participation of young people with cystic fibrosis: Using the ICF model as a basis for design</field><field name="creator">Allison Mandrusiak</field><field name="description">This thesis uses the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) model (World Health Organisation, 2001) to explore the multidimensional presentation of strengths and problems in young people with cystic fibrosis (CF), firstly examining its theoretical &#8220;fit&#8221; to the health condition, and secondly using it to characterise the performance of those with CF. Few studies in the literature demonstrate such an holistic approach to the physiotherapy assessment and management of this population. It was expected that this description of performance would provide a framework for identifying key areas for physiotherapy exercise intervention. This then formed the basis for further studies to examine the effect of a targeted exercise program (compared to current exercise practice) on inpatient outcomes, as well as on outcomes of outpatient management. The position paper included provides theoretical support for the ICF model as an appropriate tool in the management of young people with CF. Building on this, Study 1 explored the practical utility of the ICF model for describing the presentation of young inpatients and outpatients with CF. Eighty-four participants with CF were recruited as a consecutive series who satisfied selection criteria to provide a cross-sectional view at younger (7-12 years, n=51) and older (13-17 years, n=33) ages. Musculoskeletal, respiratory and physiological measures represented the body structures and functions domain, the six-minute walk test and jump tests were included in the activities domain, and participation was described by the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire&#8211;Revised Version and Fels Physical Activity Questionnaire. Contextual factors were also considered (age, gender, inpatient/outpatient status). In this exploratory study, performance of this population was compared to normative data where available. Also, correlations between measures within and between ICF domains were examined as suggested by the model itself. Finally, effects of contextual factors on performance were investigated using univariate analysis of variance. This first study and the position paper support the ICF model as an effective tool for describing performance of young people with CF, and for investigating functional relationships within and between domains. Results showed significant differences in this population compared to normative data, and interrelationships were identified within and between ICF domains. Between inpatients and outpatients in the specified age groups, there was a statistically significant difference in means for a number of measures, whereby inpatients displayed consistently poorer mean scores than outpatients, with this effect significantly stronger in the older age group. The application of the ICF model was useful for highlighting areas to target in physiotherapy exercise intervention, and for substantiating selected measures to assess the program&#8217;s effectiveness across domains. Study 2 was a randomised controlled trial with blinded assessor, which investigated the effectiveness of a 10-14 day inpatient-based exercise program (the Cystic Fibrosis: Fitness Challenge) (CF:FC) tailored for young people with CF (7-17 years). The CF:FC program (n=15) included exercise strategies based on recommendations from previous work in the field, and from findings from Study 1. This program included a portable exercise package (FitKitTM) designed to be adaptable to limited space environments such as at the hospital bedside, important when inpatients with CF are isolated according to infection control procedures. Participants in the control program (n=16) received the current exercise practice provided for young people with CF at a tertiary hospital, which included mainly aerobic-type activities to affect airway clearance. Performance on study measures (scoped within the framework of the ICF model, presented in Study 1) were compared pre- and post-intervention (admission and completion of the inpatient exercise program) between the groups. This trial showed significant improvements for participants in both groups from admission to discharge for a range of measures, including respiratory function, muscle strength and quality of life measures. Participants in the intervention group showed significantly greater improvements for some measures, for example: ankle dorsiflexor strength, six-minute walk distance and perception of their respiratory status. The continuation of the intervention and control programs into the outpatient setting was the focus of Study 3. The FitKitTM was provided for the intervention group, incorporating strategies to enhance adherence including a physical activity log (PAL) and internet-based follow-up. The control home exercise program consisted of the current practice provided on discharge. Interestingly, the control group improved significantly in hip abductor strength and six-minute walk distance during the outpatient period, whereas the intervention group sustained the improvements gained in the inpatient period but generally showed no further significant improvement. When the change from inpatient admission to outpatient follow-up was considered, it was apparent that greater improvements during the inpatient period provided a &#8216;buffer&#8217; to accommodate for possible deteriorations in function in the outpatient phase. Issues regarding adherence to exercise programs during the outpatient period are discussed. This thesis confirms the usefulness of the ICF model for describing young people with CF, guiding assessment and review processes to achieve comprehensive management, and strengthening the evidence-base for targeted physiotherapy exercise intervention. A novel, tailored exercise program is introduced which is effective during inpatient periods, and provides a maintenance effect during outpatient periods, but strategies to enhance adherence during outpatient periods require further investigation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">Cystic Fibrosis</field><field name="subject">Exercise</field><field name="subject">ICF model</field><field name="subject">Randomised controlled trial</field><field name="subject">Inpatient</field><field name="subject">Outpatient</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183778</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation into the effects of a lifestyle intervention on body fat distribution and fatty acid metabolism: Study of obese non-diabetic adults and a case study of McArdle disease</field><field name="creator">Stephanie Ipavec Levasseur</field><field name="description">The global epidemic of obesity is rapidly becoming a major public health problem in many parts of the world. Unhealthy diets and physical inactivity are two modifiable risk factors for prevention of obesity and its associated chronic diseases. Their influence on muscle energy metabolism and fat mass is not completely elucidated. A decreased capacity for fatty acid oxidation (FAO) may be a metabolic risk factor for weight gain and is found to be depressed in obese individuals; and exercise training may promote an increased capacity for FAO. In addition to the interest in whole-body FAO, the role of site specific lipid accumulation including visceral adipose tissue (VAT), intrahepatic lipids (IHL) and intramyocellular lipids (IMCL) has become a focus of interest because of their reported association with insulin resistance (IR), a key metabolic defect associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, ambiguity persists regarding the importance of IMCL as a metabolic substrate for energy production in obesity. A better understanding of the factors regulating FAO, body fat distribution and IMCL mobilisation is important for the development of interventions allowing effective treatment of conditions in which these are disturbed. The study of individuals with metabolic myopathies can give more information about the energy metabolism of muscle. McArdle disease (MD) affects glucose availability to muscle for energy production. Investigations into IMCL storage and mobilisation in MD have not been reported. The aims of this thesis are to investigate 1) the effects of weight-loss via dietary restriction plus modest but clinically-relevant exercise training on FAO, body fat distribution and mobilisation of IMCL during exercise in obese non-diabetic adults; 2) the effect of an exercise training intervention on IMCL storage and mobilisation in a subject with MD. All obese subjects underwent a 4 month lifestyle intervention with weekly meetings with a dietitian and an exercise physiologist. Of the 92 subjects, 73 completed the intervention. They showed significant decreases in body weight (8%), fat mass (14%) and total cholesterol (5%). The exercise prescription of 1500 kcal.week-1 resulted in variable compliance with the prescription (1224 &#177; 1085 kcal.week-1) measured by heart rate monitor. Those who did most exercise and also those who had less weekly variability in their exercise, had greater reductions in body weight and fat mass. The total activity energy expenditure measured by accelerometry did not change post-intervention but there was a reduction in low intensity activity and an increase in moderate and high intensity activity. A submaximal treadmill test and resting metabolic rate (RMR) using indirect calorimetry was measured before and after the intervention to investigate factors regulating FAO and energy expenditure. Subjects showed increases in FAO without change in energy expenditure for the same walking speed post intervention, but the volume of exercise completed during the intervention was not associated with these changes. To investigate body fat distribution in obesity, VAT, IHL and soleus muscle IMCL was measured in a sub-group of 18 males by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) along with measurement of maximal aerobic capacity. Fitness increased significantly with significant decreases in VAT (29%) and IHL (54%), without significant change in IMCL. Subjects who had the greatest decrease in VAT were those who exercised for longer durations during the intervention. IHL was the only measure of excess lipid that correlated with IR. The measurement of IMCL before and after 1-hour of cycle ergometer exercise showed no significant mobilisation of IMCL either at baseline or after the lifestyle intervention. The intensity of the acute exercise was adjusted to correspond to each individual&#8217;s maximal fatty acid oxidation (MFAO) which increased by over 60% post intervention. In the subject with MD, an 8 week exercise training intervention without dietary intervention increased IMCL stores by 27%, but there was no marked change in IMCL with acute exercise at both time points. The findings of this thesis demonstrate that a clinically relevant and achievable lifestyle intervention incorporating weight loss through diet and objectively measured exercise can achieve improvements in blood lipid profile, body composition and FAO. The differential effects of the intervention on the various fat depots and their associations to metabolic markers suggest that individualised strategies may be required dependent upon body fat distribution. The non detection of mobilisation of IMCL by MRS suggests that these lipids may not be present as a substrate source in this population but rather an ectopic lipid depot related to increased energy consumption in diet. The relatively low capacity for FAO in both the obese and MD subjects may have affected the results. This thesis discusses implications for clinical practice, discusses novel findings related to the energy metabolism in obesity and MD and informs clinical and basic science about important future directions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">body fat distribution</field><field name="subject">exercise</field><field name="subject">fatty acid oxidation</field><field name="subject">intrahepatic lipids</field><field name="subject">intramyocellular lipids</field><field name="subject">lifestyle intervention</field><field name="subject">magnetic resonance spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">McArdle disease</field><field name="subject">obesity</field><field name="subject">visceral adipose tissue</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183796</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optical Quantum Information: New States, Gates and Algorithms</field><field name="creator">Benjamin Lanyon</field><field name="description">One of the current hot topics in physics is quantum information, which, broadly speaking, is concerned with exploring the information-processing and storing tasks that can be performed in quantum mechanical systems. Besides driving forward our experimental control and understanding of quantum systems, the field is also in the early stages of developing revolutionary new technology of far reaching implication. As part of these endeavors, this thesis presents some results in experimental quantum information. Specifically, we develop several new tools for performing quantum information processing in optical quantum systems, and use them to explore a number of applications and novel physical phenomena. A central theme, and one of the most sought after applications of quantum information, is the pursuit of a programmable quantum computer. This thesis is divided into 3 parts. In Part I we develop some new optical quantum logic gates, which are tools for manipulating quantum information and the fundamental building blocks of a quantum computer. We also develop a new technique for simplifying the construction of quantum logic circuits, by exploiting multi-level quantum systems, that has the potential for application in any physical encoding of quantum information. In Part II we use these tools to perform some of the first demonstrations of quantum algorithms. Each of these could, in principle, efficiently solve an important problem that is thought to be fundamentally intractable using conventional `classical' techniques. Firstly we implement a simplified version of the quantum algorithm for factoring numbers, and demonstrate the core processes, coherent control, and resultant entangled states required for a full-scale implementation. Secondly we implement an algorithm for calculating the energy of many-body quantum systems. Specifically, we calculate the energy spectrum of the Hydrogen molecule, in a minimal basis. Finally we demonstrate an algorithm for a novel model of quantum computing that uses mixed states. Here we perform the first characterisation of intrinsically non-classical correlations between fully separable quantum systems, captured by the 'discord'---a measure of quantum correlations in mixed states that goes beyond entanglement. Part III presents a technique that extends experimental control over biphotons---the novel quantum information carriers formed by the polarisation of two photons in the same spatial and temporal mode. We also generate and explore new forms of entanglement: producing the first instance of qubit-qutrit entanglement, by entangling the polarisation of a photon and a biphoton, and developing a technique that enables full control over the level of `W-class' of multi-partite entanglement between the polarisation of three photons.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">02 Physical Sciences</field><field name="subject">Quantum Information, Quantum Computing, Linear Optical Quantum Computing, Quantum Optics, Pulsed Parametric Down-conversion.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183809</field></doc><doc><field name="title">All the World's a Stage: Constructing and Performing the Textual Self in Charlotte Bront&#235;'s Fiction</field><field name="creator">Mari Webb</field><field name="description">Charlotte Bront&#235;&#8217;s problematising of first-person narrative foregrounds the fluidity of the concept of identity and insists on its constructed nature. Bront&#235; uses specific narrative techniques in The Professor, Jane Eyre and Villette to achieve this foregrounding, which leads to a complex and sophisticated exploration of the individual&#8217;s relationship to society, and how this influences the way individuals construct their identity. Each of these novels presents a different example of such self-construction through the characterisation of the first person narrator. Bront&#235;&#8217;s questioning of the stability of the self encourages readers to be aware of such constructs. In my first chapter, I look closely at how narrative authority is parcelled out in Bront&#235;&#8217;s nineteenth-century society, and what influence the conferring or withholding of such authority has on the construction of a narrative self. The next three chapters are devoted to discussion of specific examples of narrative self-construction in Bront&#235;&#8217;s first-person novels, how her protagonists deal with narrative authority, and the difficulties inherent in speaking or writing with such authority for nineteenth-century women in particular. Individuals construct a sense of their self through telling stories. Bront&#235;&#8217;s fiction asks the question, if &#8220;Literature cannot be the business of a woman&#8217;s life&#8221; is this tantamount to denying women the right to an arena for the construction of a self at all? What role do readers play in the construction of a narrative self for a writer? In the concluding chapter my aim is to open out my analysis of Bront&#235;&#8217;s fiction by examining the idea of narrative as a place more generally for imaginative self-construction. I structure the chapter around J.

The possibility of human life-span extension has provoked debate amongst bioethicists. Proponents of life-extension cite the benefits of a longer and healthier life. Opponents argue that these technologies: violate human nature; may not necessarily increase the quality of life; and, they will lead to overpopulation and social strife that outweighs any benefits to individuals. Others see problems of equity and justice in access to any potential life-extension technologies. The attitudes of members of the public have largely been neglected in ethical and policy discussions of human life-extension. In the absence of empirical evidence on public attitudes, proponents and opponents have assumed either widespread public enthusiasm for life-extension or strong opposition because of concerns about its moral acceptability or its adverse social consequences. All agree that public attitudes could be a powerful facilitator or a major obstacle to the development of life-extending technologies. The goal of this thesis is to characterise public attitudes towards life-extension and describe factors that influence these views. It examines the following questions: (1) What is the prevalence of public support for (or opposition to) life-extension research? (2) How much interest is there among the public in using a technology that could increase life-span by slowing ageing? (3) What issues are important to members of the public in forming their attitudes? (4) What ethical issues, if any, do members of the public identify? (5) Are these ethical and moral issues the same ones expressed by ethicists and social scientists? (6) How do these ethical attitudes affect their overall interest in, or support for, life-extension? (7) How are attitudes towards life-extension related to demographic characteristics such as age, gender, education, and religious beliefs? Three empirical studies were designed using a mixed methodology to answer these questions. Study 1 (focus groups) and Study 2 (individual interviews) were qualitative investigations of public attitudes towards life-extension. The results of these two studies informed the design of Study 3 - a quantitative survey of attitudes towards life-extension via telephone interviews with 605 adult members of the Australian public. Participants in Study 3 were presented with a vignette outlining the prospect of a life-extension pharmaceutical that could increase life-span to 150 years by slowing the ageing process. They were then asked to express their level of agreement with a series of statements about ethical, social and personal implications of life-extension, and their overall support and interest in using such a technology. All three studies found mixed public attitudes towards the development and use of life-extension technologies. Participants in Studies 1 and 2 were concerned about whether life-extension would be accompanied by good quality of life. Studies 1 and 2 also suggested that participants were concerned about social and ethical issues that included: the potential impact on society; whether life-extension was &#8220;natural&#8221;; and whether access to life-extension technologies would be fair and equitable. Study 3 confirmed the diversity of public views identified in the qualitative phase. While 65% supported such research, only 35% said that they would use a life-extension technology if one became available. Men were more supportive of research and more disposed to use life-extension technologies than women. 58% of participants expressed ethical or moral concerns about life-extension technologies. When asked to weigh up the potential benefits and negatives that they identified as important, almost half (48%) said that life-extension technologies would do more harm than good to society, and 40% thought that taking a life-extension pharmaceutical would do them more harm than good personally. Study 3 also showed that valid scales could be constructed to assess the strength of concerns about social and ethical issues. These scales were: personal benefits/negatives; social benefits/negatives; and natural concerns. Higher levels of support for using and developing life-extension technologies were associated with higher levels of perceived personal and societal benefits from life-extension. Participants who had more ethical concerns, and perceived more personal and social negatives were less likely to support or express an interest in using life-extension technologies. Perceptions of personal and social benefits, and having concerns about the &#8220;naturalness&#8221; of life-extension were the best predictors of support or interest in using life-extension technologies. This thesis shows that public attitudes towards life-extension are more varied than some ethicists have assumed. While there are substantial minorities who were clearly &#8220;pro&#8221; or &#8220;con&#8221;, many members of the public are concerned about ethical and social issues. It would be unwise for researchers of life-extension not to take account of public attitudes and concerns if they hope to foster public support for their work.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">life-extension</field><field name="subject">anti-ageing</field><field name="subject">bioethics</field><field name="subject">Enhancement</field><field name="subject">public attitudes</field><field name="subject">biogerontology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183814</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecological principles that underpin host testing for weed biological control &#8211; a case study with the lantana sap-sucking bug, Aconophora compressa Walker (Hemiptera: Membracidae)</field><field name="creator">Andrew Manners</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT 1. Aconophora compressa Walker (Hemiptera: Membracidae) was introduced into Australia from Mexico in 1995 for the biological control of lantana (Lantana camara L.: Verbenaceae). Pre-release host testing implied minimal non-target effects from this gregarious stem feeding insect. Post-release, A. compressa is sometimes present on several plant species in the field in Australia and is mostly associated with fiddlewood (Citharexylum spinosum), an exotic ornamental tree of Caribbean origin. Field sampling has indicated that lantana harbours A. compressa mainly as a &#8220;spillover&#8221; from fiddlewood and does not persist on lantana when populations on fiddlewood are low. 2. This thesis investigated the interaction between A. compressa and six host taxa on which it is found in the field in Australia. To this end, adult survival and reproduction, nymphal survival and development and the consequences of the long distance host finding behaviour of A. compressa were quantified experimentally. A model was developed to calculate the number of adults produced on each host taxon, based on glasshouse data similar to that typically collected in biological control host testing. Output from the model was then compared to host use data from the field to examine the consistency between glasshouse and field data. 3. Modelled adult production indicated a discrepancy between the relatively high performance of A. compressa on lantana under glasshouse conditions and its relatively low abundance on lantana in the field. The results indicate that fiddlewood can be considered the primary host plant species of A. compressa in southeast Queensland. In terms of the numbers of eggs laid and nymphal survival and developmental rates, fiddlewood was by far the best host, followed by lantana, Duranta erecta (cultivars geisha girl and Sheena&#8217;s gold), jacaranda (Jacaranda mimosifolia) and Myoporum (Myoporum acuminatum). Oviposition and nymphal developmental rates on the last two were low and these plants are used only incidentally in the field by A. compressa. The remaining hosts, including lantana, are effectively secondary hosts because they are evidently used mainly when high densities of A. compressa develop on fiddlewood and then spillover onto the other hosts, where they do not persist as they do on fiddlewood. 4. The effect of nymphal host plants of different quality on adult survival and reproduction were investigated in a reciprocal cross experiment with the primary host (fiddlewood) and a secondary host plant (geisha girl). Time spent feeding on the secondary host during any life stage had a negative affect on the ultimate reproductive capacity of the A. compressa individuals involved, even when insects that had developed on geisha girl as nymphs were moved to fiddlewood at adult eclosion. Modelled adult production indicates that the numbers of A. compressa produced on fiddlewood exceed those produced on geisha girl by a factor of about 10-20. The model output also supports the interpretation derived from field data, indicating that populations of A. compressa on secondary host plants derive mainly from a spillover when densities on fiddlewood are high. 5. The relative colonisation rates across sentinel fiddlewood and lantana plants placed in the field resolved the discrepancy between the ability of A. compressa to survive and reproduce well on lantana under glasshouse conditions, but being found in the field on lantana only at low rates. Aconophora compressa individuals located the sentinel lantana plants to a much lesser extent than they did fiddlewood (20 vs 80%, respectively). Aconophora compressa placed on potted lantana and fiddlewood in the field remained on the plants and laid egg batches at equal rates. Adult production across these hosts was re-modelled to include the rates at which these species are colonised in the field, and output strongly resembled the relative intensities of host use recorded in the field. 6. Surveys in southeast Queensland were conducted over 15 months in a repeated measures design. Data verify that A. compressa was present on secondary and incidental hosts mainly as a spillover from fiddlewood. Field surveys in Mexico revealed that host use by A. compressa was consistent with that in Australia. In Morelos, the state in which A. compressa was most abundant, A. compressa was found on Lantana urticifolia, Duranta erecta and Tecoma stans at similar relatively high rates and on jacaranda and a number of other plant species at relatively low rates. Fiddlewood species were rare and were found only in areas with extremely low densities of A. compressa, so the intensity at which this species are used could not be established at the time. 7. Weed biocontrol host testing methods published over the last 10 years were reviewed, with emphasis on the degree of replication, and which raised questions about the number of replicates required for host testing. There were 489 experiments in 118 papers. Most experiments used relatively few replicates and about 75% of all experiments for which the median number of replicates could be determined (415 cases) had five or fewer replicates (319 cases). About half of all papers (37 of 83 papers with sufficient detail to determine their exact methods) included experiments in which singular replicates were repeated sequentially. About 30% of multiple host choice tests included different combinations of test plants in each cage. In statistical terms, such a design lacks replication. It is hoped that these results will initiate discussion that leads to minimum standards with regard to replication in weed biocontrol host testing experiments. 8. Overall, the experimental data (outlined in points 3 to 6, above) were used to justify the beneficial aspects of determining host plant species status, before release, in terms of their being primary, secondary or incidental hosts and to ensure that the target weed is indeed the primary host. The reason that A. compressa is ineffective against lantana is because lantana is a secondary host and thus falls outside the &#8220;sensory target&#8221; range of A. compressa. The term, &#8220;host specific&#8221; is discussed in relation to its use in weed biocontrol; how it implicitly directs the types of experiments conducted and interpretation of host testing results. A framework for identifying host relationships is developed with an eye for continued improvement of the theory and thus the practice of weed biocontrol host testing.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183832</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Natural Regeneration and Management of Secondary Forests in Lao PDR and Vietnam</field><field name="creator">Sean Mcnamara</field><field name="description">Factors relating to natural regeneration and tree community recovery after slash and burn agricultural practices were investigated in secondary seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTF) of varying land use intensity and post-disturbance management. Patterns and processes of regeneration were explored by collecting community composition data at secondary and primary sites, by conducting seedling experiments, and by investigating existing forest rehabilitation efforts in both Lao PDR (Laos) and Vietnam. In the forests surveyed in Laos, forest recovery in terms of the composition of primary forest tree species juveniles in fallow forests was high at most sites regardless of previous land use intensity. While community compositional studies indicated significant differences between primary and secondary communities, little or no significant differences were found in terms of primary tree species or family diversity, evenness, or dominance of regenerating juveniles. Significant differences appeared to be due to changes in the relative abundances of different species rather than the absence of primary forest obligate species in the secondary communities. This effect is expected to be due to the relatively common resprouting ability of SDTF species, the wide range of ecological conditions that these species can persist under, and the mosaic pattern of land-uses across the landscape. Evidence of environmental filtering affecting composition patterns in secondary communities was found for two plant traits; dispersal syndrome and plasticity of specific leaf area (SLA). Ecological strategies of primary SDTF tree species were investigated in two ways. Within the narrow range of species capable of regenerating within the primary forest environment, evidence of different life history strategies was found, indicated by significant correlations between continuous plant traits of seed size, fruit size, maximum tree height, SLA, leaf size and wood density. The correlations found largely mirrored patterns found in similar studies in Neotropical forests. Evidence of different seedling regeneration strategies was investigated by comparing species of two different successional preference groups in a seedling/light experiment. Seedlings of non-pioneer later successional species responded differently than species more associated with disturbed environments (long-lived pioneers) when exposed to both increasing absolute light treatments, and to light received under various sunfleck treatments. Earlier successional species demonstrated greater plasticity of SLA, leaf area ratio (LAR), stem elongation, and root mass ratio to increasing light. Regeneration under minimally managed monoculture and pair-wise plantations of both native and exotic species at the Laos field site was not significantly different when compared with nearby remnant primary forest in terms of diversity, evenness, and richness. Therefore, plantation overstoreys did not appear to be suppressing the regeneration of primary forest species. Seedlings grown in enrichment designs nearby had survival rates of approximately 50%, and diameter increments of less than 0.2 cm/yr after 6 to 9 years of growth. The performance of seedlings in such plantings is expected to be sufficient for conservation aims but is unlikely to encourage private investment for forestry purposes due to long expected rotation lengths. At Hai Van Pass in central Vietnam, the combination of a fast growing exotic species to capture a degraded site and ameliorate site conditions, followed by enrichment planting of native species was demonstrated to be a successful approach to reforesting degraded land, whilst funding itself through the sale of timber. The results indicate the high regeneration potential of the studied secondary forests, both in terms of observed patterns of regeneration in slash and burn fallow forests, and in terms of the general regenerative abilities of SDTF species. Decisions regarding future land-uses and secondary forest management should have consideration of this possible high level of recovery, and simple diversity sampling techniques should be included in any related processes to confirm the regeneration potential of a particular secondary forest.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">seasonally dry tropical forest</field><field name="subject">laos</field><field name="subject">secondary forest</field><field name="subject">regeneration</field><field name="subject">biodiversity</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183863</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epigenetic modifiers of transgene silencing in the mouse</field><field name="creator">Daniel Morgan</field><field name="description">It is well established that epigenetic modifications to the genome are crucial for the exquisite control of gene expression required for an organism to develop and differentiate. These modifications are maintained through mitotic rounds of cell division, but must be cleared and reset through meiosis in order for the cells of the early embryo to achieve totipotency. Although we know these mechanisms exist, the rules determining which modifications are established where on the genome and the genes involved in these processes remain poorly characterised. Much of what is known about epigenetic processes has come from studies in non-mammalian organisms, such as Drosophila. However, in our laboratory we have developed a mammalian system for identifying modifiers of epigenetic gene silencing. An ENU mutagenesis screen is being carried out using an inbred mouse line carrying a GFP transgene, with an erythroid-specific promoter, that is particularly sensitive to changes in epigenetic modifications. Currently, 14 mutant lines that display a heritable shift in GFP expression have been recovered. These have been termed Modifiers of Murine Metastable Epialleles (Mommes). When I began my PhD in 2005, we had not identified any of the mutations underlying the phenotypes observed. To confirm the efficacy of the screen, I have tested the effect of heterozygosity for null alleles of two known epigenetic modifiers, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, on expression of the GFP transgene. Heterozygosity for the Dnmt3b knockout allele does shift expression while heterozygosity for the Dnmt3a knockout allele does not. This highlights the limitations of the screen. With this particular screen we will only detect modifiers that are expressed during haematopoiesis in the bone marrow. I have also worked on MommeD5. MommeD5 is a semi-dominant, homozygous embryonic lethal mutation that acts as an enhancer of variegation. I have found that the MommeD5 allele carries a 7 bp deletion in the major histone deacetylase, Histone deacetylase 1 (Hdac1), and this significantly alters the C-terminus of the mutant protein. The finding of Hdac1 attests to the screen design. The MommeD5 homozygous mutants die at approximately the same time as the published knockout of Hdac1 and the heterozygous mutants show increased levels of Hdac2 and acetylated histone H3, as reported in Hdac1-deficient embryonic stem cells. In addition, I have studied the effect of heterozygosity for each of the mutations on the phenotype of the mouse. In general, heterozygous Momme mutants are viable and fertile, but show subtle abnormal phenotypes. However, in the case of MommeD5 none were observed and this may relate to the compensatory upregulation of other histone deacetylases. In the case of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b a sex ratio distortion is seen in the colonies, with less males seen than expected. Also, Dnmt3a heterozygous mutant males that inherited the mutant allele from the dam are smaller and show an increased range of body weights compared to their wild-type male littermates. This may be an example of intangible variation, i.e. phenotypic variation observed in isogenic individuals raised in standardised environments. These results suggest that epigenetic mechanisms have a role in intangible variation, also known as developmental noise. Despite the fact that it is now acknowledged by many that stochastic events occur at the level of the cell, the idea that it can happen at the level of the whole organism is rarely considered.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DNA methyltransferase, epigenetic gene silencing, epigenetic modifiers, heterozygosity, histone deacetylase, intangible variation, sex ratio distortion</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183870</field></doc><doc><field name="title">FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS OF GENES CONTROLLING PRODUCTION OF THE LATERAL BRANCHING INHIBITOR IN PEA</field><field name="creator">Tanya Brcich</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a molecular-based study undertaken to analyse the expression of the RAMOSUS1 (RMS1) and RAMOSUS5 (RMS5) genes in pea (Pisum sativum). Both genes encode carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase (CCD) enzymes that are together proposed to control the synthesis of an inhibitor of bud outgrowth termed SMS (Shoot Multiplication Signal). SMS was recently identified as strigolactone. Expression analyses of RMS1 presented here have built upon earlier experiments which demonstrate it to be a highly regulated transcript. RMS1 mRNA levels are known to be rapidly decreased following removal of the shoot apex but are subsequently restored to that of intact plants by auxin (indole-3-acetic acid or IAA). This regulatory mechanism is retained in all five ramosus mutants tested to date. Together with physiological data, this indicates RMS1, and therefore SMS, are required in IAA-mediated suppression of bud outgrowth. Another significant aspect of RMS1 regulation identified in previous studies involves a graft-transmissible, long-distance feedback signal that moves from shoot to root. This feedback regulation is dependent on the RMS2 gene and enhances RMS1 expression levels. Prior to the cloning of RMS5 and its discovery as a second CCD enzyme in the RMS network, reciprocal grafting studies with the rms mutants indicated RMS5 may act in the same pathway as RMS1 to produce SMS. Multiple studies presented here demonstrate that these two CCD genes are expressed in similar tissues and are regulated by the same signals, specifically IAA and the RMS2-dependent feedback signal. Like RMS1, the RMS5 gene also retains its IAA response in the rms mutants. However, RMS5 is generally less responsive to changes in IAA and RMS2-dependent feedback, as it exhibits smaller fluctuations than RMS1 in its expression levels. Together these findings support a general view that RMS1 is more likely to control a rate-limiting step in SMS synthesis. A previous study indicated that RMS1 expression may be up-regulated by IAA through a posttranscriptional mechanism. This thesis sought to more closely examine the RMS1 and RMS5 IAA response by separately observing the effect of IAA on subsequent transcription. New transcripts, termed heterogenous nuclear RNAs (hnRNAs), were relatively quantified in parallel with existing mRNAs in the steady-state cytoplasmic pool. The experiments conducted here provide further evidence that IAA may act post-transcriptionally to stabilise RMS1 mRNA because the changes in hnRNA are not proportional to the changes in mRNA following IAA-modifying treatments. IAA may still function to induce transcription of RMS1, but this does not appear to be a significant mechanism by which IAA regulates RMS1 expression. In contrast, the IAA induction of RMS5 occurs predominantly via new transcription and RMS5 either lacks or is not as strongly subjected to the IAA-mediated mRNA stabilisation mechanism proposed for RMS1. Initial studies described in this thesis also suggest that IAA could act to regulate the expression of the Arabidopsis orthologues MORE AXILLARY BRANCHING (MAX) genes via a post-transcriptional mechanism. Analyses of MAX hnRNA and mRNA levels in Arabidopsis to date indicate it is the RMS5 orthologue MAX3 which exhibits an IAA response most like RMS1. Additional studies into the regulation of RMS1 and RMS5 presented in this thesis provide further insights into the molecular mechanisms controlling their expression levels. In vitro experiments with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide demonstrate that RMS5 expression levels are increased when protein synthesis is reduced, as previously shown for RMS1. Relative quantification of RMS1 and RMS5 hnRNA levels further demonstrate that the induction by cycloheximide is due primarily to an increase in new transcription, indicating that RMS1 and RMS5 are negatively regulated by a rapidly turned-over transcriptional repressor. Tissue specific effects on RMS1 expression were also observed which are consistent with a protein degradation function of the RMS4 F-box in the shoot. This thesis provides further evidence to suggest that SMS acts in concert with IAA to inhibit the sustained outgrowth of axillary buds. RMS1 and RMS5 expression levels are not regulated by a hypothetical fast decapitation signal which is proposed to cause the initial bud outgrowth occurring prior to decapitation-induced IAA depletion. RMS1, RMS5 and SMS are therefore unlikely to control the initial exit of buds from dormancy to an intermediate transition state. Studies here also suggest that enhanced shoot auxin transport and cytokinin biosynthesis are associated with axillary bud outgrowth because the rms mutants contain elevated shoot expression levels of a gene encoding the auxin efflux carrier PIN1 and two genes controlling cytokinin biosynthesis. Several approaches described in this study were used to characterise the RMS1 and RMS5 proteins. Anti-peptide antibodies were generated against both proteins and the results obtained show that although the antibodies are likely to recognise the full-length proteins, further work is required to effectively detect RMS1 and RMS5 in plant tissues via western blotting. Preliminary in situ immunolocalisation results indicate the RMS1 and RMS5 proteins are localised to the vasculature, consistent with gene expression analyses.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">RAMOSUS</field><field name="subject">bud outgrowth</field><field name="subject">carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase</field><field name="subject">auxin</field><field name="subject">RNA</field><field name="subject">post-transcriptional</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183901</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Essential and Nonessential Genes of Bovine Herpesvirus-1</field><field name="creator">Karl Robinson</field><field name="description">Bovine herpesvirus-1 (BoHV-1) is an important pathogen of cattle associated with respiratory and reproductive disease and is the most common viral agent implicated in the bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC). BRDC is an economically significant multifactorial disease of feedlot cattle estimated to cost Australian feedlot producers $AU60 million/year in lost production, therapeutics and disease management. Worldwide BRDC is attributed to cost $US2 billion to cattle industries. In an effort to limit the associated economic costs and enhance animal health and welfare of feedlot cattle, the concerted use of vaccination and diseased animal management are practiced. Numerous vaccines are available in North America and Canada however, in Australia, feedlot producers are reliant on three vaccines. These vaccines target either the bacterial or viral agents of the BRDC and encompass antibody, subunit and attenuated live BoHV-1 preparations. Live attenuated vaccines are developed by numerous methods including, deletion or disruption of certain genes. The development of an attenuated live virus vaccine was traditionally a laborious task requiring numerous rounds of in vitro purification. Contrastingly, technological advances introduced this decade, allowing the stable maintenance of the complete herpesvirus genome in bacteria as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC), has advanced herpes virology exponentially in that investigation and manipulation of the herpesvirus genome can be conducted independent of a cell culture system. With respect to BRDC and the generation of vaccines to combat the disease, the tools to fully utilise the potential of BoHV-1 as a live vaccine vector are now routine. It is now possible to vii construct BoHV-1 as a delivery vector by inserting appropriate antigens of those bacterial and viral pathogens implicated in the BRDC into a BAC maintained BoHV-1 genome. However, there is a significant lack of genetic information regarding BoHV-1 and inserting several antigenic sequences would expand the genome of BoHV-1 inducing non-viability. Therefore, to further develop BoHV-1 as a vaccine vector, a study was conducted to identify the essential and nonessential genes required for the in vitro viability of BoHV-1. Identifying the essential and nonessential genes will establish which genes may be preferentially deleted or replaced with exogenous antigenic sequences in a BoHV-1 derived vaccine vector. To define the requirement of genes encoded by BoHV-1, random-insertion mutagenesis utilising a Tn5 transposition system and targeted gene deletion catalysed by GET recombination was employed to construct gene disruption and gene deletion libraries, respectively, of an infectious clone of BoHV-1. Transposon insertion position and confirmation of gene deletion was determined by direct sequencing. with the essential or nonessential requirement of either transposed or deleted open reading frames (ORFs) assessed by transfection of respective BoHV- 1 BAC DNA into host cells. Of the 73 recognised ORFs encoded by the BoHV-1 genome, 33 were determined to be essential and 36 to be nonessential for virus viability in cell culture with the requirement of the two dual copy ORFs inconclusive. The majority of ORFs were shown to conform to the in vitro requirements of BoHV-1 homologues encoded by Human herpesvirus 1. However, ORFs encoding for glycoprotein K (UL53), regulatory, membrane, tegument and capsid proteins (UL54, UL49.5, UL49, UL35, UL20, UL16 and UL7) were shown to differ in requirement when compared to Human herpesvirus-1 encoded homologues. Further analysis of clones encompassing restriction digestion profiling, one-step growth and replication kinetic analysis defined the genetic constitution and replicative capacity of the mutant clones. Thirty-three individual ORFs of the 36 defined nonessential ORF were identified as being amenable to deletion without causing significant replicative detriment to a potential BoHV-1 vaccine vector. This study has provided the foundational information required for the future development of BoHV-1 as a multivalent vaccine vector for the protection of feedlot cattle from BRDC. Furthermore, the genetic information generated in this study contributes to the general knowledge of the prototype ruminant herpesvirus, BoHV-1, and contributes to the comparative study of gene function between the large and diverse family that is Herpesviridae.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">07 Agricultural and Veterinary Sciences</field><field name="subject">Bovine Herpesvirus-1</field><field name="subject">Bacterial Artificial Chromosome</field><field name="subject">Gene Requirement</field><field name="subject">Transposon Mutagenesis</field><field name="subject">GET recombination</field><field name="subject">Vaccine Vector</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183917</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulating Protease Activated Receptor 2</field><field name="creator">Yung Suen</field><field name="description">Protease-Activated Receptors (PARs) belong to an unusual family of G Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs). Each of the four known members is activated by its own N-terminus exposed by proteolytic cleavage and there is no other endogenous agonist known to date. PAR2 is the second member of the family and it has been implicated in wide range of pathophysiological conditions, particularly in various inflammatory diseases and cancers. In contrast, very little is known about the PAR2 receptor itself despite having been discovered more than 10 years ago. The purpose of this project was to improve our understanding of PAR2 regulation by discovering new agonists and antagonists and using them to probe the structural and functional properties of the receptor. Chapter 1 provides a brief literature overview of the initial discovery of PAR2, what is known about the mechanism of receptor activation, information on the structures and properties of current agonists and an antagonist for PAR2, and the putative physiological roles of human PAR2. As well, it summarizes the aims of this thesis. Chapter 2 investigates the regulation of gene expression by two different agonists of PAR2, a synthetic hexapeptide, 2f-LIGRLO-NH2, and the endogenous activator, trypsin, the idea being that genes up- or down- regulated by both agonists may more accurately profile PAR2-selective events. The effects of PAR2 activation on gene transcription in the human kidney HEK293 cell line were studied using a DNA microarray consisting of 19,000 human genes in an attempt to broadly cover the human genome and associated cell pathways with PAR2 activation. About 2,500 genes were regulated similarly by both agonists and, for genes expressed more than 5-fold, the mRNA results were further analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR techniques. PAR2 activation was shown to be associated with cellular metabolism, cell cycle, mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, histone deacetylase and sirtuin enzymes, inflammatory cytokines and anti-complement function. Chapter 3 described a range of molecular events surrounding the activation of the receptor. PAR2 mRNA expression was quantitated by qRT-PCR and cross-checked with an intracellular Ca2+ assay. In this way whole cell PAR2 could be correlated with cell surface expression of PAR2. Three cell lines expressing high levels of PAR2 were chosen for subsequent experiments, these being colorectal carcinoma HT29, lung carcinoma A549 and human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells. Receptor activation, internalization, desensitization and resensitization assays were carried out on these cell lines to define some key functions relevant for investigating inhibitors in subsequent chapters. Chapter 4 reports a PAR2 mutagenesis study designed to identify the location of the binding site on PAR2 for a specific peptide agonist. A homology model of PAR2 based on bovine rhodopsin was used for docking of an agonist ligand, and the docking results were then investigated via two successive rounds of PAR2 mutagenesis in which the effect of each mutation (20 in all) was separately investigated by changes in agonist potency in the intracellular calcium release assay. Five PAR2 mutants showed more than a 5-fold reduction in agonist potency, while three others showed up to a 7-fold reduction. Mutations found to be important for agonist activity were mapped back to the model. Because there was extensive clustering of these key mutated amino acids, it is likely that this study has pinpointed the precise binding site of the agonist peptide in PAR2. Interestingly, this site is within the transmembrane region of the receptor. Chapter 5 reports the design, discovery and development of novel PAR2 agonists and antagonists and their regulatory effects in a diverse array of cell types. Structure-activity relationships were used to examine influences on the first, sixth and seventh positions of a PAR2 agonist peptide. At least five compounds were found herein to be equiopotent with the most potent PAR2 agonist reported. Knowledge obtained from this study was then used to create the first non-peptidic agonists for PAR2. The most potent nonpeptidic agonist (retaining one natural amino acid) was at least equipotent with the best peptide agonists. Conversion to nonpeptidic antagonists proved to be successful and this chapter reports the most potent known nonpeptide antagonist, which was selective for PAR2 and active at low micromolar concentrations. It inhibited intracellular Ca2+ release induced by different PAR2 agonists (trypsin, 2f-LIGRLO-NH2, nonpeptide agonists) in multiple cell lines (HT29, Panc-1, A549, MKN1, MKN45, MDA-MB-231, HUVEC) that have been physiologically associated with PAR2. It also inhibited release of inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and IL-6 and shows antiproliferative activity against primary human cells. The antagonist is competitive, reversible and surmountable (pA2 6.11). This thesis summarizes a large body of work that provides valuable molecular insights to PAR2 regulation, and lays the groundwork for rational design and development of novel nonpeptidic agonists and antagonists of PAR2 as potentially valuable pharmacological probes in vivo and as useful leads to development of therapeutics for inflammatory diseases and cancers.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">GPCR</field><field name="subject">protease activated receptor 2</field><field name="subject">Protease</field><field name="subject">Trypsin</field><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="subject">Membrane Receptor</field><field name="subject">PAR2 Agonists</field><field name="subject">PAR2 Antagonists</field><field name="subject">inflammation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183936</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Migration as Transnational Leisure: The Japanese in South-East Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Jun Nagatomo</field><field name="description">In the 1990s, the bubble of the Japanese miracle economy burst and the country fell into recession. Following this, Japan experienced considerable economic and social transformation, including a reconsideration of its approach to work and employment. Among the consequences of these changes, such as unprecedented mobility in the labour market and an increase in part-time employment, there was a shift in lifestyle values, particularly those of middle class Japanese. In contrast to the traditional Japanese work ethic and company-orientated lifestyle which prized collectivism and self-sacrifice, new lifestyle values were largely centred on attaining an improved life-work balance which was less structured and more &#8216;Western.&#8217; These new individualised lifestyle values began to be reflected in a new-found interest in leisure, characterised by a shift from group-oriented leisure activities to more individualised and personalised ones. There has been another very significant change of great relevance to this thesis: an increased and unprecedented interest in overseas tourism and migration. This thesis discusses an intriguing new dynamic between the transformation of the economy and the Japanese engagement with tourism and migration. Until the 1990s, due to the guaranteed lifetime employment and the prevalence of seniority systems of Japanese corporations, there was a relatively stable life model among Japan&#8217;s middle class. In addition to healthy demand in the domestic labour market and work-dominated lifestyle, stable work opportunities meant this group rarely considered pursuing individual tourism and migration. However, since the 1990s, increasing numbers of young middle class Japanese began to drift from the safe and assured life model and chose to live abroad. This thesis, based on qualitative methodology and in-depth interviews with 31 Japanese migrants to Queensland, is a study of Japanese lifestyle migration to Australia. It draws upon several important topics and theories in contemporary sociology including globalisation, transnationalism, migration and tourism. The complex linkages between these themes are an important characteristic of this thesis and are discussed in the literature review of Chapter 2. The methodological issues of this research are presented in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 contextualises lifestyle migration against the background of broader history of Japanese migration to Australia. The chapters that follow examine three key themes pertinent to exploring the interrelationship between social transformation in Japanese society in the 1990s, changing lifestyle values and migration to Australia. Chapter 5 considers the implications of social transformation of Japanese society, specifically focusing on the lifestyle value shifts as push factors in a broad sense. Chapter 6 explores the pull factors and focuses on motivations for migration to Australia. Chapter 7 examines the lives of Japanese lifestyle migrants in Australia and highlights a unique settlement process characterised by the lack of upward social mobility, the absence of geographical concentration of Japanese migrants and the impact this has on the formation of a sustainable ethnic community. Finally, Chapter 8 summarises the argument of this thesis and discusses its contribution to the field of sociology. Possible directions for future research are also outlined.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">immigration</field><field name="subject">lifestyle migration</field><field name="subject">ethnic community</field><field name="subject">settlement</field><field name="subject">work</field><field name="subject">leisure</field><field name="subject">social transformation</field><field name="subject">Australian multiculturalism</field><field name="subject">Japanese society</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183953</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Response of Milk Synthesis to the Supply of Ammonia and Amino Acids</field><field name="creator">Norman Purdie</field><field name="description">Milk protein content of cows in subtropical Queensland declines from the beginning of winter to the end summer and is a repeatable consistent observation across years. The genesis of such an event is hypothesised to lie in the nutritional and environmental changes that occur over this period with a change in forage type from the temperate species to the tropical species, a change in cereal grain supplementation and a reduction in intake associated with heat stress causing a change in the nutritional supply to the animal. A series of experiments examined the effect of high levels of ammonia absorption on milk production and milk components in dairy cows. The experiments used extensive, grazing trials with supplements of urea to increase ammonia absorption, and intensive, infusion of ammonia into cows indoors. Feeding urea in the supplement of cows grazing ryegrass increased milk protein significantly by 0.05 percentage units but had no effect on milk volume. Infusing ammonia intra-venously reduced milk volume (~ 20%) and milk protein content (&lt;0.1 percentage units). The primary finding of these experiments was that infusion of high ammonia levels into dairy cows will depress milk protein production and content. However, the levels of ammonia absorption experienced under usual strip grazing conditions in Queensland over winter are not high enough to affect milk protein production and content. The effect of altering substrate supply and pattern associated with the shift in feed supply from winter to summer was examined by infusing different amino acid patterns and acetate into cows by a close arterial infusion method. Infusate was delivered to the external iliac artery, allowing the mammary gland first pass use of the nutrients. Supplying amino acids by infusion increased milk protein yield 18.7 vs 19.7 g/h (5.3 %) for infused half of the udder. Milk protein yield was increased more (19.2 vs 20.2 g/h for infused half of the udder) by infusion of a milk amino acid profile compared to a microbial amino acid profile. Infusing acetate has no effect on milk protein yield but decreased milk yield for infused half of the udder (560 vs 510 g/h). It may be concluded, that under the practical levels of crude protein and ammonia supply which arise from different agronomic practices (N fertiliser) and grazing management (stage of growth, strip grazing), that any practical increase in ammonia supply per se to the liver does not explain the depression in milk protein percentage seen in Queensland dairy herds.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Milk</field><field name="subject">Milk protein</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183999</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Folio of Compositions and Critical Commentary</field><field name="creator">Daniel Salecich</field><field name="description">Through an innate desire to present works with an underlying musical philosophy and a mastery of technical phenomena, this folio of compositions and critical commentary is an attempt to present a progressive collection of my original music with an accompanying philosophical and analytical examination. Within the folio, there is experimentation, use of many external and seemingly unrelated sources, and the employment of specific modern techniques when the underlying philosophy demands it. The folio demonstrates a willingness to utilise a wealth of sources, extramusical content, and to experiment and collaborate on project outcomes. Inspiration in part is drawn from composer Ge&#246;rgy Ligeti, who sees the compositional process as a series of problems that emerge and need to be resolved. Thus, each musical form, though complete in itself, is conceptually in a constant state of flux and renewal. Some more recent concepts within this folio include the creating of a time-space (that is, prolonging the inevitable outcome of a musical idea); exploring apparent spectral and microtonal harmonies; severely constricting musical material; being inspired by extramusical content; producing information-saturated works and using jazz-inspired improvisatory techniques; borrowing from seemingly unrelated sources; and using electronic and recorded music in conjunction with live acoustic musicians. This folio of works and critical commentary presents eight compositions with a detailed analysis of my approach to each work and aesthetic viewpoint.

Many strategies, such as chemical modification, synthesis of peptidomimetics and formulation, have been employed to overcome these issues. For central nervous system (CNS) active peptides, the blood brain barrier is an added hurdle. Nasal delivery is believed to provide a direct access to the brain via the olfactory nerve, which would bypass the blood brain barrier. This route of administration, however, is dependant on the size and physico-chemical properties of the administered drug. For these reasons, three CNS active peptides were chosen as models. Leu-enkephalin, endomorphin-1 and a-conotoxin MII are three peptides that differ in their size, amino acid sequence and conformation. Using chemical modifications to improve their stability and ability to cross biological membranes, in vitro assessments of derivatives of these peptides were performed and in vivo nasal delivery was attempted on the most promising candidates. The chemical modifications consisted in the addition of lipids and/or sugars to the N- or C-terminus of the peptides. Assessment of the in vivo bioavailability after nasal administration, however, proved to be challenging. The initial method chosen for this purpose was the use of tritiated acetic anhydride which would radiolabel the peptide via acetylation at the N-terminus of the peptide derivatives. Consequently, in vitro stability and permeability of each acetylated derivatives was also studied. Acetylation of the lipidic derivatives, which formed an amide bond, proved to be beneficial for the stability of the lipidic peptides. In contrast, acetylation of the Nterminus sugar derivatives, which formed an ester bond at one or several positions of the sugar, was an unstable modification. Thus, an extraction method for the tested peptides from rat tissues was developed, and LC-MS/MS analyses were conducted to measure the level of peptide in the olfactory bulbs, brain and blood. Leu-enkephalin derivatives were all amide derivatives at the C-terminus of the peptide. The most successful Leu-enkephalinamide derivatives were C8-LeuEnk (2), C12- LeuEnk (3) and Lac-LeuEnk (8), which are the Leu-enphelinamide peptide modified with a C8 lipoamino acid, a C12 lipoamino acid and a lactose moiety respectively. They all exhibited improved permeability across Caco-2 monolayers and stability in Caco-2 cell homogenate and/or plasma. Problems of solubility encountered with C12-LeuEnk (3), however, hampered its testing in vivo after nasal administration. C8-LeuEnk (2) and Lac-LeuEnk (8) were administered intranasally to male Sprague-Dawley rats. Both peptides were found in the olfactory bulbs after 10 minutes administration (2: 49.2 &#177; 15.6 nM; 8: 40.6 &#177; 14.6 nM) while blood concentration remained low, showing that the peptide reached the olfactory bulbs directly from the nasal cavity via the olfactory nerve. Brain concentrations were 13.5 &#177; 10.1 nM for C8-LeuEnk (2) and 13.6 &#177; 6.9 nM for Lac-LeuEnk (8). These two peptides brain concentrations seemed to be high enough to exhibit analgesic effect when compared to their binding affinity in vitro. This was not statistically significant, however, due to the high standard deviations observed (Ki&#956; C8-LeuEnk (2) = 7.74 &#177; 1.15 nM; Ki&#956; Lac-LeuEnk (8) = 6.69 &#177; 1.81 nM). Endomorphin-1 was only modified at the N-terminus as previous results have shown that the activity of the peptide is strongly decreased by C-terminus modifications. The most successful modification, regarding permeability across Caco-2 monolayers and water solubility, was shown to be the addition of a lactose moiety to the N-terminus of the peptide. Lac-Endo1 (16) exhibited a permeability of 1.91 &#177; 0.76 x 10-6 cm/s and was soluble at the concentration used for in vivo nasal administration (2 mg/Kg, 50 &#956;L administration). After 10 minutes administration, Lac-Endo1 (16) was found in the olfactory bulbs (418 &#177; 410 nM), in the brain (4.01 &#177; 4.61 nM) and in the blood (1.58 &#177; 1.85 nM). The large standard deviations observed reflect the difficulties encountered with the extraction process of this peptide. A direct transport for the nasal cavity to the olfactory bulb was observed as illustrated by the low blood concentrations. Brain concentrations, however, were too low to expect a strong analgesic effect from this compound after nasal administration (Ki&#956; Lac-Endo1 (16) = 11.3 &#177; 1.2 nM). a-Conotoxin MII is a 16 amino acid long peptide containing two disulfide bonds. The formation of these two disulfide bonds leads to low yields in the synthesis of the derivatives of this peptide. Addition of a lipidic moiety to the peptide did not seem to improve its permeability through biological membranes. This modification resulted in highly lipophilic peptides with dissolution issues in water based media such as those used in the permeability experiments. The most successful a-conotoxin MII derivative was GS-Ctx (25) which exhibited a permeability of 4.22 &#177; 0.53 x 10-7 cm/s across Caco-2 monolayers. This permeability, however, was too low to consider in vivo administration. In conclusion, we successfully synthesised a series of derivatives of Leu-enkephalin, endomorphin-1 and a-conotoxin MII and screened them through Caco-2 monolayers for permeability and Caco-2 cell homogenates and human plasma for stability. Three derivatives (C8-LeuEnk (2), Lac-LeuEnk (8) and Lac-Endo1 (16)) were intranasally administered and found in the olfactory bulbs 10 minutes after administration. The low blood concentrations observed show that a direct transport from the nasal cavity to the brain occurs. Thus, nasal administration could be an option for delivering to the brain low molecular weight peptides exhibiting increased stability and permeability in vitro.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nasal delivery</field><field name="subject">CNS active peptides</field><field name="subject">Leu-enkephalin</field><field name="subject">Endomorphin 1</field><field name="subject">Alpha conotoxin MII</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184027</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing Globalisation: Governing the subjects and spaces of Queensland education in the first decade of the 21st century.</field><field name="creator">Stephen Hay</field><field name="description">This thesis documents the attempts by one Australian State government to manage assumed social and economic risks associated with its transition into a globalised economy and society. The specific research focus is on the policy strategy Queensland State Education&#8211;2010 (QSE-2010) developed by the Queensland State government and released in 2000. The thesis adopts a governmentality perspective to develop a policy case study focusing on the formulation of QSE-2010 through to its implementation as set out in the Queensland Government&#8217;s 2002 White Paper, Education and Training Reforms for the Future. The research demonstrates how one State education system in Australia was transformed as a result of the spread of global risk rationalities originating in comparative studies conducted by the OECD. The study begins by examining how QSE-2010 was discursively positioned within a policy environment characterised by the transformation of social and economic relations into deterritorialised flows and globally connected networks of the global knowledge economy. Queensland&#8217;s future prosperity in this emerging context was articulated as unpredictable and uncertain. The policy discourse of QSE-2010 thus presented the global as a novel problem space requiring intervention by responsible government. This analysis identifies the key policy role of knowledge producing practices such as statistical studies, international comparisons and performance benchmarking in transforming global uncertainty into a form that was conducive to governmental programming in education. In the case of education in Queensland, this involved mobilising specific calculative technologies to transform global economic uncertainty into knowable and calculable educational risk. This was expressed in QSE-2010s principal performance target that required 88 percent of students to complete Year 12 by 2010. This study further traces how Education Queensland&#8217;s aspirations to manage globalisation risks were translated into practical programs of social and educational governance. It proposes that the concept of social capital was critical for providing a means of attributing economic value to certain patterns of social interaction within families and between families and communities. Once authorities were able to link particular patterns of sociability to increased levels of educational attainment, it became possible to problematise the social capital of some families as a potential source of risk for educational disengagement of students. Here, the social capital believed to characterise the professional, globally networked middle class family emerged as a model for education authorities in Queensland for re-configuring the social capital of disadvantaged families. Social capital thus became instrumental in Education Queensland&#8217;s strategy to govern the relationships between schools and their communities, especially relationships between the home and school. Understanding of the problem of educational disengagement afforded by social capital led to attempts to impose particular forms of social capital on Queensland families. This was achieved by mandating the involvement of parents and students in the process of Senior Education and Training Plans. These plans were formally negotiated education and training pathways that students would follow for the completion of the senior phase of learning and the award of the Queensland Certificate of Education. The study argues that governmental technologies such as social capital are critical determinants of the limits and possibilities for social justice outcomes in education policy because they function to constitute both the problems of government and the scope of legitimate policy intervention. It further argues that these technologies have been instrumental in sustaining neoliberal policy solutions in Queensland education because they render invisible socio-economic explanations for educational disadvantage and structured inequalities in education. The study concludes by exploring alternative policy configurations that are made intelligible by alternative ways of representing the social and economic context of schooling.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">education policy, globalisation, governmentality, risk, subjectivity, social investment, social capital, social inequality</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184043</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ENDOSOMAL MEMBRANE FUSION IN MACROPHAGES AND NK CELLS</field><field name="creator">Stephanie Wood</field><field name="description">The immune system is comprised of specific cell types that communicate and interact via a range of soluble and surface-bound molecules to defend the body against pathogens. Many gaps remain in our understanding of the subcellular trafficking pathways that regulate the diverse functions of the immune system. The central aim of this thesis was to investigate transport through the endocytic pathway, focussing in particular on the unique organelles and functions of this pathway in immune cells. Two subsets of immune cells were of particular interest in this thesis, macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells. These cell types both perform a range of functions that contribute to both innate and adaptive immunity. Another common thread between these cells is that they both perform functions involving specialised endocytic organelles and pathways. Macrophages utilise their endocytic pathways to perform several unique functions; phagocytosis, endocytosis and degradation of foreign proteins for presentation on MHC class II molecules, and signalling of Toll-like receptors from endosomes. Even secretion of cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#945;) by macrophages requires transport through an endosomal compartment, the recycling endosome, as recently discovered in this laboratory (Murray et al., 2005a). NK cells utilise specialised secretory lysosomes to deliver a lethal hit to carefully identified target cells, providing an alternative example of specialised endocytic trafficking in the immune system. Of the many protein families that regulate subcellular trafficking, the SNARE, Rab, Munc and exocyst proteins were focussed on during this thesis. The localisation and function of members of these families in the endocytic pathway were investigated. Novel results in macrophages concerned the role of Vti1b in endocytosis, a process with implications for MHC class II antigen presentation and TLR detection of endocytosed particles. Alteration of Vti1b protein levels in the cells significantly decreased uptake and degradation of endocytic cargo. A role for Rab11 and the recycling endosome in antigen presentation was also studied. MHC class II was detected in recycling endosomes, and overexpression of a mutant Rab11 protein altered the distribution of MHC class II, suggesting a role for Rab11 in subcellular trafficking during antigen presentation. Preliminary results also suggest a role for the exocyst protein Sec15 at the recycling endosome in macrophages, providing a new target for investigation of the regulation of TNF&#945; secretion. The recycling endosome is emerging as a vital transport hub during cytokine secretion, phagocytosis and possibly other cellular functions in macrophages. This project also involved the unique opportunity to examine primary NK cells from patients with a number of genetic immunodeficiencies caused by mutations to trafficking proteins. The autosomal recessive immunodeficiencies Griscelli syndrome type 2 (GS2) and familial haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis types 3 (FHL3) and 4 (FHL4) are associated with loss-of-function of Rab27a, Munc13-4 and syntaxin 11 (Stx11), respectively. These diseases involve a loss of cytotoxic function by cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes and NK cells, but the precise molecular role of these proteins in granule release is incompletely understood. In freshly isolated, resting NK cells from healthy subjects, PMA and ionomycin stimulation or conjugation to susceptible target cells induced colocalisation of endogenous Rab27a and Munc13-4 to perforin-containing granules. In Rab27a-deficient cells, which showed defective degranulation and cytotoxicity induced by signals for both natural and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, Munc13-4 failed to colocalise with perforin upon activation. Unexpectedly, Rab27a and Munc13-4 localisation to lytic granules was selectively induced by different receptor signals, demonstrating specificity for regulation of lytic granule maturation by target cell ligand expression. Recruitment of the SNARE protein Vti1b, which has not previously been associated with NK cell function or secretory lysosome release, to perforin granules was also discovered. Unexpectedly, Stx11 was not localised to perforin granules. These experiments have contributed to our understanding of the precise molecular roles of Munc13-4, Rab27a and Stx11 in NK cell granule release. Overall, this thesis presents novel and important results from studies of subcellular transport through the endocytic pathways of macrophages and NK cells. These results advance our understanding of several immune functions, and a number of human genetic immunodeficiencies. This new knowledge of the role of endocytic organelles and fusion machinery in these processes provides exciting targets for future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Snare</field><field name="subject">Endosome</field><field name="subject">granule</field><field name="subject">Macrophage</field><field name="subject">NK cell</field><field name="subject">Membrane Fusion</field><field name="subject">Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184053</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Impact of Increased Access to Traditional Lean Meat and Exercise Interventions on Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors in the Aboriginal Community of Woorabinda (Wurru Yurri &#8211; Kangaroo Meat).</field><field name="creator">Teresa Hazel</field><field name="description">Aim: - This research project was a community based intervention study of the impact of increased access to exercise opportunities and kangaroo meat on diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk factors in the Aboriginal community of Woorabinda. The exercise and dietary interventions were based on principles of community development including: training of community members to conduct exercise programmes; supply of exercise equipment; training of community members to harvest kangaroos; establishment of a butcher&#8217;s apprenticeship; and establishment of the kangaroo meat processing in the community. Methodology: - The impact of the kangaroo meat and exercise interventions on diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk factors was determined by pre- and post-intervention assessment. Pre-intervention baseline data was obtained by community clinical assessment, household meat surveys,and community exercise surveys. The post-intervention assessment was a repeat of modified meat and exercise surveys. A post-intervention community clinical assessment was not conducted due to unresolved difficulties encountered in conducting the research project. The Study Population: - The study population for the community clinical assessment and exercise surveys were volunteer adults B 15 years of age. Approximately one third of the adult population participated in the community clinical screening, 29% in the pre-intervention exercise survey, and 20.2% in the post-intervention exercise survey. The meat surveys were conducted on a household basis. There was 84% household participation in the pre-intervention meat survey and 44.3% postintervention. Findings and Discussion: - It was found that the exercise and kangaroo meat interventions did not follow the planned linear trajectory but rather proceeded in an episodic and incremental manner. The community clinical assessment found a high prevalence of diabetes (18.6%; 95% CI, 13.04 &#8211; 24.36%) and impaired glucose tolerance (13.2%; 95% CI, 8.3 &#8211; 18.1%) comparable to that found in other Indigenous communities. There was a low prevalence of hypercholesterolaemia (30.9%; 95% CI, 24.2 &#8211; 37.6%) and hypertension (19.7%; 95% CI, 13.9 &#8211; 25.5%). High prevalence for other diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk factors were found including: current smoking (48.3%;95% CI, 40.95 &#8211; 55.64%); and obesity as measured by body mass index (35%; 95% CI, 27.9 &#8211; 42%), waist circumference (83.7%; 95% CI, 76.5 - 90.86% in women; and 55.5%; 95% CI, 43.9 &#8211; 61.1% in men), and waist / hip ratio (75.5%; 95% CI, 66.9 &#8211; 84% in women; and 57.1%; 95% CI,46 &#8211; 68% in men). A high prevalence of abnormal ACR was found: the prevalence ACR 3.4 &#8211; 33.9g/mol was 11.7% (95% CI, -ve2.39 &#8211; 25.7%), and the prevalence ACR B 34g/mol was 7.6% (95% CI, -ve6.8 &#8211; 22%). The prevalence of proteinuria was 67.8% (95% CI, 59.3 &#8211; 76.3%). It was found that this high prevalence of renal disease indicators coincided with an escalating incidence of end-stage renal disease in the community. Analysis of the kangaroo meat surveys found evidence of positive dietary change including reduction in the amount of fat used to cook non-kangaroo meats, and a positive shift in stage of change for cooking for family health. In regard to kangaroo meat however it was found that the most common cooking method was unfavourable with the nutritional value of the meat being compromised by a significantly higher prevalence of frying than other meats. It was further found that this method for cooking kangaroo meat was unchanged by the research intervention. Evidence of positive change was also seen in analysis of the exercise surveys. It was found that at baseline, and post-intervention, that the majority of adults in the community met the recommended duration for exercise per week through activities of daily living. There was a positive shift in stage of change for exercise behaviour with a significant movement beyond the &#8216;precontemplation' towards the &#8216;action&#8217; and &#8216;maintenance&#8217; stages of change. This positive shift in thinking about exercise corresponded with a significant increase in the proportion of people exercising specifically for health and fitness. Conclusion: - Though not all the proposed intervention objectives were accomplished the research project contributed to furthering community aspirations and capacity. The community clinical assessment provided a useful overview of the health status of Woorabinda, and an opportunity of a thorough health check for community members. The community clinical assessment drew attention to future projections of disease in Woorabinda and prompted a concentrated health system response. Evidence of positive change in regard to meat consumption and exercise behaviours were found, changes however were slow and uneven. Improved infrastructure was important to increasing community capacity for kangaroo meat supply and exercise, but essential to the sustainability of community initiatives is skilled people, and on-going maintenance and support. The findings of this study indicate that simplistic assumptions around the health benefits of &#8216;traditional&#8217; diet need to be reconsidered cognisant that communities such as Woorabinda are cultures in transition. Whilst limitations in the methodology require the findings to be considered with caution, this study provides useful evidence for planning future health education and health promotion initiatives for Woorabinda.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aboriginal</field><field name="subject">diabetes</field><field name="subject">cardiovascular risk factors</field><field name="subject">renal disease</field><field name="subject">kangaroo meat</field><field name="subject">exercise</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184136</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diet and Domestic Life in 21st Century Australia: An Exploration of Time and Convenience in Family Food Provisioning</field><field name="creator">Elizabeth Schubert</field><field name="description">Drawing on Weber&#8217;s rationalisation theory and feminist critiques of the consumption-production literature, this thesis describes the impacts and changes in dietary practices that have occurred in households as a result of limited or constrained time available for family food provisioning, and how these changes can be understood as a product of contemporary Australian policy, cultural and food landscapes. It adopts feminist ethnography and household food strategies as important methodological innovations to forge a culturally informed account of convenience-orientated dietary practices in family households within contemporary Australian society. The data were collected from 15 Brisbane family households between January 2002 and August 2006. The thesis argues that dietary practices observed in &#8216;time-poor&#8217; households have evolved as solutions to the problem of time scarcity by women whose role has traditionally been to feed families. The &#8216;solutions&#8217; are shaped by the resources to which households have access, and ideas and traditions about family care, food and its responsibility, and available alternative options. Change is observed in diets, menus, source of prepared meals and prepared ingredients, but also organisation of food provisioning and distribution of workload. Also being reshaped is the role of food in the expression of cultural identity, commensality and, in the family setting, the transmission of food skills and knowledge. An analysis that critiques the usefulness of &#8216;speeding up&#8217; domestic food provisioning as a viable and sustainable solution to the retention of the family meal is drawn, highlighting the problematic nature of persistent nostalgic interpretations of commensal eating patterns in culinary, food activism, sustainability and nutrition discourses. In the absence of a coherent moral philosophy for guiding current public health policy and practice, Kittay&#8217;s public ethic of care is proposed as a suitable model. A key challenge for future research is to ensure that household level sociocultural analysis continues to enrich broader debates in food policy and public health.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">household food strategies</field><field name="subject">rationalisation</field><field name="subject">convenience</field><field name="subject">feminist ethnography</field><field name="subject">public ethic of care</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184155</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Progress-based verification and derivation of concurrent programs</field><field name="creator">Brijesh Dongol</field><field name="description">Concurrent programs are known to be complicated because synchronisation is required amongst the processes in order to ensure safety (nothing bad ever happens) and progress (something good eventually happens). Due to possible interference from other processes, a straightforward rearrangement of statements within a process can lead to dramatic changes in the behaviour of a program, even if the behaviour of the process executing in isolation is unaltered. Verifying concurrent programs using informal arguments are usually unconvincing, which makes formal methods a necessity. However, formal proofs can be challenging due to the complexity of concurrent programs. Furthermore, safety and progress properties are proved using fundamentally different techniques. Within the literature, safety has been given considerably more attention than progress. One method of formally verifying a concurrent program is to develop the program, then perform a post-hoc verification using one of the many available frameworks. However, this approach tends to be optimistic because the developed program seldom satisfies its requirements. When a proof becomes difficult, it can be unclear whether the proof technique or the program itself is at fault. Furthermore, following any modifications to program code, a verification may need to be repeated from the beginning. An alternative approach is to develop a program using a verify-while-develop paradigm. Here, one starts with a simple program together with the safety and progress requirements that need to be established. Each derivation step consists of a verification, followed by introduction of new program code motivated using the proofs themselves. Because a program is developed side-by-side with its proof, the completed program satisfies the original requirements. Our point of departure for this thesis is the Feijen and van Gasteren method for deriving concurrent programs, which uses the logic of Owicki and Gries. Although Feijen and van Gasteren derive several concurrent programs, because the Owicki-Gries logic does not include a logic of progress, their derivations only consider safety properties formally. Progress is considered post-hoc to the derivation using informal arguments. Furthermore, rules on how programs may be modified have not been presented, i.e., a program may be arbitrarily modified and hence unspecified behaviours may be introduced. In this thesis, we develop a framework for developing concurrent programs in the verify-while-develop paradigm. Our framework incorporates linear temporal logic, LTL, and hence both safety and progress properties may be given full consideration. We examine foundational aspects of progress by formalising minimal progress, weak fairness and strong fairness, which allow scheduler assumptions to be described. We formally define progress terms such as individual progress, individual deadlock, liveness, etc (which are properties of blocking programs) and wait-, lock-, and obstruction-freedom (which are properties of non-blocking programs). Then, we explore the inter-relationships between the various terms under the different fairness assumptions. Because LTL is known to be difficult to work with directly, we incorporate the logic of Owicki-Gries (for proving safety) and the leads-to relation from UNITY (for proving progress) within our framework. Following the nomenclature of Feijen and van Gasteren, our techniques are kept calculational, which aids derivation. We prove soundness of our framework by proving theorems that relate our techniques to the LTL definitions. Furthermore, we introduce several methods for proving progress using a well-founded relation, which keeps proofs of progress scalable. During program derivation, in order to ensure unspecified behaviour is not introduced, it is also important to verify a refinement, i.e., show that every behaviour of the final (more complex) program is a possible behaviour of the abstract representation. To facilitate this, we introduce the concept of an enforced property, which is a property that the program code does not satisfy, but is required of the final program. Enforced properties may be any LTL formula, and hence may represent both safety and progress requirements. We formalise stepwise refinement of programs with enforced properties, so that code is introduced in a manner that satisfies the enforced properties, yet refinement of the original program is guaranteed. We present derivations of several concurrent programs from the literature.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">concurrency</field><field name="subject">refinement</field><field name="subject">verification</field><field name="subject">derivation</field><field name="subject">safety</field><field name="subject">progress</field><field name="subject">liveness</field><field name="subject">formal methods</field><field name="subject">enforced properties</field><field name="subject">leads-to</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184167</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating Lapita subsistence and pottery use through microscopic residues on ceramics: methodological issues, feasibility and potential</field><field name="creator">Alison Crowther</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the results of experimental and archaeological investigations of microscopic plant residues on Lapita pottery from the western Pacific Islands. Lapita is a critical phase in the culture history of the Pacific region and has been associated with the development and spread of a subsistence system based on the cultivation of tropical starch crops, particularly those in the taro-yam complex. However, few archaeobotanical remains been recovered from Lapita sites to lend empirical support to this model. This study explores whether microscopic starch granules, calcium oxalate crystals and other plant microremains on Lapita potsherds can provide direct evidence for the preparation and consumption of staple plant foods, as well as important clues to the function and use of pottery in Lapita society, matters which remain the subject of some debate. This research was undertaken in two main phases. The first involved a series of technical studies aimed at developing methods for recovering and identifying starch and raphide residues on archaeological pottery. Changes to starch during cooking and charring under different heat and moisture conditions were examined to understand how granules survive differentially depending on cooking method and food type. Various methods used to extract native starch granules from charred residues were then tested and a procedure based on a weak oxidising treatment was developed for use on the archaeological residues. The reliability of calcium oxalate raphide analysis, which is much less developed than that of starch, was also critically assessed. Issues with previous identifications of raphides in Pacific microfossil assemblages were highlighted. Morphological criteria were presented for identifying aroid raphides more accurately and chemical tests were developed to differentiate them from naturally-occurring calcite crystals, which were abundant in the sites analysed. The second phase of research analysed microscopic residues on Lapita and post-Lapita potsherds from archaeological sites in the Mussau and Anir Islands (PNG), the Reef Islands (Solomon Islands), New Caledonia, and the Samoan Archipelago. Despite the generally small quantities of residue recovered from the archaeological samples, several sherds with possible use-related starch residues were identified. These initial results indicate that ceramic vessels, including both plain and dentate-decorated Lapita wares, were employed in a variety of tasks involving the cooking and/or consumption, and storage or preparation of starch-based foods. It was also found that these were among the activities performed at the &#8216;special purpose&#8217; stilt house structure at the ECA site, which raises questions about the possible social or ritual status of staple starch resources in Lapita society. One of the most significant findings to emerge from this study was of taro (Colocasia esculenta) starch granules on sherds from the ERA Lapita site (Anir, New Ireland), and granules identified tentatively as taro on sherds from RF-2 (Reef Islands) and Mulifanua (Samoa). A number of unidentified morphotypes were also present on the Lapita and post-Lapita sherds, suggesting that a variety of plants not among the key root crops were also exploited. These may include some of the many fruits and nuts attested in archaeobotanical assemblages from Pacific sites. The ceramic residue data complement starch and phytolith evidence recovered from cultural sediments from RF-2, which demonstrate the presence and probable exploitation of a suite of crop plants typically associated with the Lapita &#8216;economic package&#8217;. In addition to taro, these include at least one cultivated species of Eumusa banana, non-domesticated (seeded) Australimusa bananas, bamboo, and possibly also Canarium, coconut, and sago. These data support models suggesting that Lapita groups were cultivating and transporting subsistence plants, including at least one of the major root crop complexes, and associated knowledge of their production and preparation across the western Pacific from the mid-late Holocene. This study demonstrated that analyses of microscopic starch residues on archaeological ceramics from the Pacific region can yield significant insights into vessel use and plant exploitation. Further methodological refinements should aim to increase starch yields, which will enable stronger associations between residues and vessel uses to be established. Expansion of reference collections is also required so that more precise identifications of the specific plant foods involved can be achieved.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lapita</field><field name="subject">Pacific</field><field name="subject">subsistence</field><field name="subject">pottery</field><field name="subject">starch</field><field name="subject">raphides</field><field name="subject">cooking</field><field name="subject">residue</field><field name="subject">microscopy</field><field name="subject">archaeology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184178</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors Affecting the Assessment of Insulation Condition of Power Transformer by Frequency Domain Spectroscopy Measurements</field><field name="creator">Kelvin Yew</field><field name="description">Power transformers are important and expensive elements within the electric power transmission and distribution utilities. Since these equipments are connected in series to the network, any inadvertent failures would cause catastrophic interruptions to the power supply. As such, it is extremely critical for the power transformer to operate continuously in order to maintain a reliable and efficient electricity supply. Ageing or defects in power transformer has a root in its insulation structure and this has always been a well-known fact. For many years, mineral oil impregnated cellulose paper (OIP) has been the choice of insulation for power transformers due to its excellent dielectric properties as well as its inexpensive price. During the course of operation, the dielectric properties of OIP insulation inevitably deteriorate due to singularly or a combination of stresses such as thermal, electrical, mechanical, chemical as well as environmental stresses. Degradation of power transformer insulation is an irreversible process and has been encountered by all power utilities around the world. However, replacing a power transformer simply by its age is impractical and uneconomical. With the increase in the population of ageing power transformers, there is an urgent need to evaluate the condition of transformer insulation so as to facilitate the planning for refurbishment or replacement of the equipment in a more appropriate manner. To address this issue, many techniques involving both chemical and electrical methods have been developed to monitor the insulation condition of oil-filled power transformers. However, some of these techniques are destructive by nature and some of them are unable to assess the insulation condition accurately. With the advancement in technology over the years, newer diagnostic methods in time and frequency domains have been developed in recent years to assess the insulation condition based on their dielectric responses. One of the newly developed methods is known as Frequency Domain Spectroscopy (FDS) measurement and it monitors the insulation condition by measuring the diagnostic parameters as a function of frequency ranging from 0.1mHz to 1kHz. The primary focus of this thesis is to adopt FDS technique to study the effects of several deterioration factors on the dielectric response of transformer insulation, so as to develop a better understanding between FDS technique and the condition of transformer insulation. To study the effects of moisture and temperature, FDS measurements were performed on a CIGRE model transformer at various moisture concentrations and temperature levels. From the experimental results, moisture and temperature have significant impacts on the dielectric response of transformer insulation. In addition to constant temperature, FDS measurements were also performed during transient temperature conditions to investigate the effects of transient temperature on the dielectric response of transformer insulation. An empirical relationship between the dielectric response produced from transient and steady temperature conditions was able to be established from the experimental results. A novel approach to study the effects of geometrical parameters was also part of this research work. An insulation model has been designed and fabricated for the purpose of this study. FDS measurements were conducted on the insulation model with different configurations of barriers, spacers and oil volume. The results showed that geometrical parameters did have an impact on the dielectric response of transformer insulation. The secondary diagnostic technique used in this research is Polarisation and Depolarisation Current (PDC) measurement and the purpose of using this method is to explore the feasibility of reducing the total PDC measurement duration as well as to determine the optimum measurement time for PDC.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">08 Information and Computing Sciences</field><field name="subject">transformer</field><field name="subject">insulation</field><field name="subject">moisture</field><field name="subject">temperature</field><field name="subject">frequency domain spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">polarisation and depolarisation current</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184180</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Treatment of Reverse Osmosis Concentrates from Recycled Water</field><field name="creator">Arseto Yekti Bagastyo</field><field name="description">Water recycling by membrane treatment is widely accepted as a leading alternative water source. This separation process creates a concentrated stream (called concentrates), containing most of the pollutants in 10%-20% of the flow; and a treated water stream. As nitrogen is a major concern, environmental regulations have become more stringent, requiring additional treatment to meet effluent standards. Other concerns include organic contaminants and potential production of halogenated organics if disinfection of the reject was applied. One option to address the problem of dissolved organic nitrogen and carbon is advanced oxidation. This oxidation could lead to degradation of refractory organic materials, which are poorly removed in conventional treatment. This project aims to evaluate treatment extent and cost of alternatives for organic (particularly nitrogen) removal in reject water addressing the following research gaps: (i) identifying the key organic pollutants present in the concentrated stream, (ii) the effectiveness and optimisation of coagulation, ion exchange and advanced oxidation; (iii) apparent cost of the different treatment methods. The untreated reverse osmosis concentrates were collected from two treatment plants:- Luggage Point, and Bundamba, both near Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. The first contains more colourful of organics than the second plant. Stirred cell fractionation with ultrafiltration membranes was used to characterise the removed key pollutants, as it offers better accuracy and reproducibility compared to centrifugation fractionation. Fluorescence spectral was used to monitor and identify specific organic compounds. The largest fraction was smaller sized &lt;1kDa. This is probably small humic substances and fulvic acids, as indicated by Excitation Emission Matrix (EEM) analysis. A smaller portion of soluble microbial products (SMPs) also contributes to the concentrates. Bundamba contains large non coloured organics including organic nitrogen with elevated ammonia-N. In contrast, Luggage Point has higher colour, inorganic carbon and conductivity with less ammonia-N. Advanced Oxidation Process (AOP) was the most effective treatment method (high removal of organics, e.g. 55% COD of initial), followed by magnetised ion exchange (MIEX) and coagulations. For UV/H2O2 AOP, the optimal operating condition 400mg.L-1 H2O2 and 3.1kWh.m-3 energy input resulted in organics removals up to 55% with complete decolourisation. The effective reduction was found in all size ranges, preferably in &gt;1kDa. Low inorganic carbon and salinity in Bundamba may allow better overall oxidation rates. MIEX also performed better in Bundamba with organic removals up to 43% and 80% decolourisation at the optimum resin dose of 15mL.L-1. Removal was preferential in size range of &gt;3kDa, with more proportional percentage for decolourisation. Similarly, ferric coagulation removed a wider size range of organics. Further, ferric achieved better organic removal in Luggage Point with up to 49%. At the same molar dose (1.5mM), ferric is superior to alum, especially in Bundamba where there were less hydrophobic compounds according to EEM. Alum is poor for treatment of high organics with less coloured water. MIEX with an operational cost (chemicals and power only) of $0.14-$0.20.m-3 treated water seemed to be the most effective treatment overall. The resin achieved better results with a slightly higher cost than coagulation, and had a lower environmental impact due to reduced sludge production. AOP offers better treatment, but at a higher cost ($0.47.m-3 treated). Combined alternatives may benefit the removal effectiveness. Furthermore, more specific identification of contaminants should be investigated separately to choose appropriate treatment for priority chemicals. Another issue is further investigation of costing, including capital, and full environmental impact of treatment.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">water reclamation</field><field name="subject">Reverse Osmosis Concentrates</field><field name="subject">coagulation</field><field name="subject">ion exchange resin</field><field name="subject">Adsorption</field><field name="subject">Advanced oxidation process</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184190</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physicochemical Factors Affecting Protein Aggregation: Biomolecular Engineering of Proteins for Enhanced Stability</field><field name="creator">Hui Wang</field><field name="description">Protein aggregation is commonly encountered during the manufacture of protein-based bioproducts in processing such as protein expression, purification, refolding, shipping and storage (Volkin and Middaugh, 1992; Brange, 2000). Aggregation may shorten the shelf-life of pharmaceutical proteins (Frokjaer and Otzen, 2005) and induce severe hypersensitivity (Rosenberg, 2006). In addition, several diseases ranging from Alzheimer&#8217;s disease to cystic fibrosis are associated with protein aggregation in the form of amyloid fibrils and plaques (Dobson, 1999; Luheshi et al., 2008). Hence, studies on protein aggregation, especially those dealing with high concentrations of proteins, are highly demanded in both academic and industrial laboratories. To address the aforementioned issues, physicochemical factors affecting protein aggregation were investigated systematically in this project. Strategies were developed to inhibit protein aggregation during renaturation and to enhance protein stability against aggregation during and after production, especially when dealing with high protein concentrations. &#8710;5-3-Ketosteroid isomerase (KSI) was used as a model for aggregation studies during protein renaturation due to its intrinsic aggregation properties. KSI was overexpressed as inclusion bodies (IBs) in Escherichia coli (E. coli). Cost- and time-efficient combination of chemical extraction and one-step affinity purification ensured the production of denatured KSI with high purity at high yield. Several key factors, including protein concentration and ionic strength, were determined to greatly influence KSI aggregation during renaturation. Polymer addition (PEG 3000 and Eudragit S-100) was found to alter KSI aggregation behaviour in a polymer-specific manner, as quantified using reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) analysis. Light scattering for second virial coefficient (SVC) measurement, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and microfluidics were applied to study the fundamental mechanism of protein aggregation. Lysozyme was further introduced as a control protein for comparison with KSI. A rapid lumped method was established to measure specific refractive index (&#8706;n/&#8706;c) and SVC values for KSI and lysozyme, which provided quantitative and qualitative information on thermodynamic interactions of molecules in solution. SPR and microfluidics were also used to explore protein aggregation properties. To our best knowledge, it is the first time SPR and microfluidics have been used to investigate protein aggregation behaviour. Both SPR and microfluidics present significant potential for assessing protein aggregation and diagnosis or drug screening of protein aggregation related diseases. The chemical and physical stability of proteins needs to be maintained after successful refolding to ensure an acceptably long shelf life, especially at high protein concentration (Chang and Hermsdorf, 2002). The pharmaceutical effects of lectins on cell growth provided incentive for studies to improve their stability. Human galectin-2 (hGal-2, a homodimeric lectin) was used as a study model in this project. Mutations were introduced at one of the two Cys residues (C57A, C57M, and C57S). Only the C57M variant was highly expressed in bacteria in soluble form. No aggregate of this mutant was detected during 3 weeks of storage. hGal-2 C57M also facilitated site-directed introduction of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) into the remaining sulfhydryl group (Cys75). Product analysis revealed rather complete conjugation with one PEG chain per protein subunit in homodimer. Neither secondary structure alteration nor the absence of binding ability to a glycoprotein (asialofetuin) was observed. The results document the feasibility of tailoring a human galectin for enhanced stability against aggregation as well as monoPEGylation, which enables further testing of biological properties including functionality as a growth regulator and the serum clearance rate of hGal-2.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aggregation</field><field name="subject">stability</field><field name="subject">&#8710;5-3-Ketosteroid isomerase</field><field name="subject">human galectin-2</field><field name="subject">second virial coefficient</field><field name="subject">surface plasmon resonance</field><field name="subject">microfluidics</field><field name="subject">mutagenesis</field><field name="subject">PEGylation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184201</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON THE ANAEROBIC DIGESTION PROCESS AT BOTH LABORATORY AND FIELD SCALE USING A MIXED WASTE FEEDSTOCK OF SEMI-DIGESTED SLUDGE AND MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE</field><field name="creator">Peta Radnidge</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT Bioreactor landfill operation has been promoted as a means of accelerating the degradation of waste for over 30 years. Accelerating the degradation of waste enables better predictability in biogas production and reduces aftercare costs. Most bioreactor landfill trials focus on the effect of leachate recirculation on otherwise conventional landfill cells. However, there is a range of design and operational measures that can be implemented with standard landfilling machinery to further enhance degradation. This thesis explores degradation rates that can be achieved in a landfill cell, designed to maximise degradation rate, with the constraint that it be constructed by standard earthmoving equipment, the waste be crudely shredded by sheep foot compactors to expose waste, and leachate recirculation be operable by landfill personnel. The major departures of these test cells from a conventional landfill cell operation were: the cells were only 3m deep; MSW loaded into the cell was crushed and bags ruptured with a sheep foot compactor; MSW was pre-mixed prior placement with digested sludge, as a ratio such that the buffering capacity of the sludge was equivalent to an amount of NaHCO3 known to successfully buffer the digestion of packed beds of MSW (10gL-1 NaHCO3 in packed bed at field capacity moisture content plus excess leachate equal to 10% of the bed volume (Lai et al 2001); and the waste was placed rather than compacted into the cell. The thesis examines the performance of two test cells, the second only containing MSW and inoculated and buffered by sequencing with the first. These performances are compared with an exhaustive set of control digestions in 200L laboratory reactors. The laboratory reactors were packed with 50kg sub-samples of the waste used in the cells, shredded to sub 5cm size. The laboratory reactors primarily focussed on the effect of temperature on degradation rates, to identify the optimum degradation rate for this sludge and MSW mixture. The laboratory scale reactors produced 231 L and 202 L of methane per kgVS at the mesophilic temperatures of 38&#176;C and 45&#176;C respectively. The degradation was faster in the 45&#176;C reactor where methane production was completely exhausted after 35 days. A laboratory reactor operated at 55&#176;C reactor showed little degradation activity. The pH of this reactor was initially over 8.5, and ammonia inhibition was suspected. However, the reactor did not respond to pH adjustments with hydrochloric acid, and subsequent step decreases in temperature did not have an effect until 47&#176;C, where degradation suddenly accelerated. This suggests the methanogenic consortia in the sludge could not adapt to thermophilic temperatures. This was confirmed in the 63&#176;C reactor which acidified and did not produce methane, until leachate from this reactor was transferred to the 45&#176;C reactor where an established methanogenic community converted the soluble COD to methane. In order to compare laboratory reactor performance with the general literature, pure cellulose was added in a fed-batch fashion to the stabilised 38&#176;C and 47&#176;C leach-beds. The beds were fed under starved conditions, to clearly distinguish degradation products from the cellulose from background levels. This also allowed for the estimation of biomass growth by measuring the uptake of NH4-N, as all other bio-available N sources such as protein and amino acids were reduced to NH4-N under these starved conditions. Hydrolysis rates were determined to be 0.12&#177;0.01 d-1 and 0.14&#177;0.026 d-1 at the 38&#176;C and 47&#176;C temperatures. Degradation in the two test cells was completed within a 7 month period. Temperature in the cells was maintained between 25 &#8211; 30&#176;C by biological activity, levels that were above ambient temperatures, but below ideal mesophilic conditions. Methane composition rapidly approached 50% in both cells, and biogas flow rates were consistent with a degradation timeframe in the order of less than year. Full flow rate data was not obtained from these trials due to mechanical problems with flow meters, however vigorous gas production was evident throughout the trial by monitoring gas composition, and the ballooning effect of the top cover. To confirm the degradation rates in the test cells, samples were collected from the second test cell and digested in laboratory reactors. Methane yields were only 2.4 and 6.4 L CH4 kgVS-1 confirming virtual exhaustion of biogas potential within 7 months of sequencing this MSW cell with the first MSW:sludge test cell. This is the first systematic experimental program that places the degradation performance of a test cell in the context of the potential degradation rate achievable with fine shredding, temperature control and thorough inoculation and buffering. Economically, in cases where degradation residues are left insitu as in landfills, the degradation enhancement in the test cells would effectively yield as much benefit as enhancing the degradation rate to a two to three week timeframe typical of an anaerobic digester (Clarke 2000).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Temperature Control</field><field name="subject">anaerobic digestion</field><field name="subject">Municipal Solid Waste (msw)</field><field name="subject">sludge</field><field name="subject">Mixed Waste</field><field name="subject">Test Cell</field><field name="subject">Bioreactor</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184219</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bayesian model of axon guidance</field><field name="creator">Duncan Mortimer</field><field name="description">An important mechanism during nervous system development is the guidance of axons by chemical gradients. The structure responsible for responding to chemical cues in the embryonic environment is the axonal growth cone -- a structure combining sensory and motor functions to direct axon growth. In this thesis, we develop a series of mathematical models for the gradient-based guidance of axonal growth cones, based on the idea that growth cones might be optimised for such a task. In particular, we study axon guidance from the framework of Bayesian decision theory, an approach that has recently proved to be very successful in understanding higher level sensory processing problems. We build our models in complexity, beginning with a one-dimensional array of chemoreceptors simply trying to decide whether an external gradient points to the right or the left. Even with this highly simplified model, we can obtain a good fit of theory to experiment. Furthermore, we find that the information a growth cone can obtain about the locations of its receptors has a strong influence on the functional dependence of gradient sensing performance on average concentration. We find that the shape of the sensitivity curve is robust to changes in the precise inference strategy used to determine gradient detection, and depends only on the information the growth cone can obtain about the locations of its receptors. We then consider the optimal distribution of guidance cues for guidance over long range, and find that the same upper limit on guidance distance is reached regardless of whether only bound, or only unbound receptors signal. We also discuss how information from multiple cues ought to be combined for optimal guidance. In chapters 5 and 6, we extend our model to two-dimensions, and to explicitly include temporal dynamics. The two-dimensional case yields results which are essentially equivalent to the one dimensional model. In contrast, explicitly including temporal dynamics in our leads to some significant departures from the one-dimensional and two-dimensional models, depending on the timescales over which various processes operate. Overall, we suggest that decision theory, in addition to providing a useful normative approach to studying growth cone chemotaxis, might provide a framework for understanding some of the biochemical pathways involved in growth cone chemotaxis, and in the chemotaxis of other eukaryotic cells.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Growth Cone</field><field name="subject">Axon Guidance</field><field name="subject">Chemotaxis</field><field name="subject">Bayesian Inference</field><field name="subject">Decision Theory</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184227</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EVALUATION OF METARHIZIUM ANISOPLIAE FOR BIOPESTICIDE CONTROL OF LIVESTOCK ECTOPARASITES</field><field name="creator">Diana Leemon</field><field name="description">THESIS ABSTRACT Current control strategies for livestock ectoparasites are limited by problems associated with chemical resistance and residues. Fungal biopesticides could provide an alternative control without these problems. However, a strategic approach is needed to first evaluate the suitability of selected fungal isolates for fungal biopesticide development. Two ectoparasites of significance to cattle and sheep are the cattle tick Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (Canestrini) and the Australian sheep blowfly Lucilia cuprina (Wiedmann). The fungus Metarhizium anisopliae (Metsch.) Sorokin) was evaluated for its potential to control these livestock ectoparasites. The growth characteristics of 30 isolates of M. anisopliae were investigated. Radial growth measurements were used to identify vigorous isolates that grew well at 30&#61616;C and were capable of growing at 35&#61616;C. A qualitative assessment of sporulation capacity further refined the candidate isolate group. A possible nutritive role of oil in the formulation was also investigated. However, there was no clear support for the theory that oil as a formulation additive could boost the germination and growth of the fungal conidia in vitro. Quantal response bioassays were conducted with cattle ticks and sheep blowflies using a range of conidial doses of three different isolates of M. anisopliae and different methods of inoculation. Ticks were either dosed with 2 &#181;l or immersed in the conidial doses. Blowflies were either dosed with 2 &#181;l of the conidial doses or fed conidia mixed with sugar. Probit analyses were carried out on the mortality data to compare the virulence of these isolates to ticks and blowflies and look for indications of different virulence mechanisms employed by M. anisopliae isolates when invading these hosts. One isolate (ARIM16) showed high virulence to both hosts killing 95 % of ticks after two days and 88 (&#177;2) % of blowflies after four days. Strikingly different mortality patterns indicated quite different virulence mechanisms operating when M. anisopliae invades ticks or blowflies. The mortality pattern seen with ticks suggested that the number of conidia adhering per unit area of the cuticle was more important for rapid tick death than the total number of conidia contacting the entire tick surface. Blowflies fed conidia mixed with food died rapidly after an initial lag phase regardless of dose. Microscopic investigations were carried out to resolve the basis of the virulence patterns observed. The spatial and temporal aspects of the invasion of ticks and blowflies by M. anisopliae isolate ARIM16 were investigated with different types of microscopy. The scanning electron microscope and stereo light microscope were used to record surface changes and events and the compound light microscope revealed internal changes. Two distinctly different patterns of invasion were found in ticks and blowflies. Fungal conidia germinated on the surface of ticks then hyphae simultaneously penetrated into the tick body and grew across the tick surface. There was extensive fungal degradation of the tick cuticle with a preference for the outer endocuticle. While large numbers of conidia adhered to the surface of blowflies, no conidia were recorded germinating on external surfaces. One germinating conidium was seen in the entrance to the buccal cavity. Investigations of the fly interior revealed a higher density of hyphal bodies in the haemolymph surrounding the buccal cavity than in haemolymph from regions of the upper thorax. This pattern suggested that fungal invasion of the blowfly is through the buccal cavity. Plentiful extracellular mucilage was seen around the hyphae on ticks, and crystals of calcium oxalate were seen amongst the hyphae on the surface of ticks and in the haemolymph of blowflies killed by M. anisopliae isolate ARIM16. It was considered that cattle ticks are more suited for control with fungal biopesticides than adult blowflies. Three field trials were conducted over twelve months to assess the pathogenicity of M. anisopliae to parasitic stages of R. microplus on dairy heifers under different environmental conditions. Two isolates were selected based on their high optimal growth temperature (30oC), good conidial production characteristics and ability to kill adult engorged ticks in the laboratory in minimum time. Conidia were formulated in an oil emulsion and applied using a motor driven spray unit. Surface temperatures of selected animals were monitored, as were the ambient temperature and relative humidity. Unengorged ticks sampled from each animal immediately after treatment were incubated under laboratory conditions to assess the efficacy of the formulation and application. Egg production by engorged ticks collected in the first 3 days after treatment was monitored. Side counts of standard adult female ticks were conducted daily, before and after treatment to assess the performance of the fungus against all tick stages on the animals. At each trial the formulation caused 100% mortality in unengorged ticks that were removed from cattle and cultured under laboratory conditions. A significant reduction in egg production was recorded for engorged ticks collected in the three days post treatment. In the field, the fungal formulation had an inconsistent effect on ticks, which might be due to the influence of environmental temperature and humidity.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Metarhizium anisopliae, biopesticide, livestock ectoparasites, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, Lucilia cuprina (cattle tick, sheep blowfly)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184229</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MOLECULAR CHARACTERISATION OF THE ALPHA-KAFIRIN MULTIGENE FAMILY FOR THE GENETIC IMPROVEMENT OF SORGHUM GRAIN QUALITY</field><field name="creator">Pratibala Pandit</field><field name="description">Sorghum is a valuable grain crop and a principle source of food of particular importance in human and animal nutrition in the semi-arid regions of Africa and Asia. Despite its value, sorghum grain quality is a major limitation to its productivity and profitability. Sorghum grain is usually discounted as feed grain when compared to wheat and barley, predominantly because of its poor digestibility. The sorghum endosperm is composed of a complex starch protein matrix, whereby the starch is physically bound within the storage proteins, the kafirins. The kafirins are synthesised on the membrane bound polysomes and have a signal peptide which targets them to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Growth of protein bodies occur as &#61537;- kafirins fill in the interior with &#61538; and &#947; kafirins occupy the periphery. Despite the &#61537;-kafirins being more digestible and composing of 60- 80% of the kafirins, they are not easily accessible due to &#61538; and &#947; kafirins which have a high content of intermolecular disulphide bonds (S-S), rendering them highly resistant to proteases. Alteration of the structure of the protein bodies and change of the location of the&#61537;-kafirins could result in a higher digestibility of sorghum proteins. This could be achieved by upregulating or downregulating the &#61537;-kafirins. The improvement of grain quality, both in increased protein and starch digestibility would substantially enhance the digestibility of sorghum as animal feed as well as for human consumption. Various techniques have been utilised to classify the kafirins according to their mobility on SDS PAGE electrophoresis, Reverse Phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC), Free Zone Capillary Electrophoresis (FZCE) and Lab on Chip. Until recently the characterisation and classification of the kafirins generally have relied on the characterisation of zeins from maize. Zeins have about 70% homology to the kafirins both at the nucleotide and amino acid level. Based on the high similarity of the &#61537;-kafirins to the &#61537;-zeins, the &#61537;- kafirins have been classified as 19 and 22 kDa. Despite their 70% homology the migration of the &#61537;- kafirins on SDS PAGE is quite different to that of the zeins. Hence, I propose a new classification of the &#61537;-kafirins as 23 kDa and 25 kDa based on their mobility on SDS PAGE Characterisation and cloning of the 23 and 25 kDa genes was performed using QL41 the Queensland inbred line of sorghum. Ten positive clones were isolated from a cDNA library for the 25 kDa and two clones for the 23 kDa &#61537;-kafirins. The isolated clones of the 25 kDa &#61537;-kafirins showed 98-99% homology with each other and also with the GenBank sequences. The major finding was the characterisation of the 23 kDa &#61537;-kafirins. The two clones obtained showed 100% homology to each other as well as to the published sequences on the GenBank, and were full-length sequences. Also a partial sequence was obtained that lacked the signal peptide and was different to the other two clones. Whilst characterising the 23 kDa a second group of the 25 kDa &#61537;-kafirins was identified from the genomic DNA, of all the three genotypes (QL41, 296B and QL12), which was unique from the previously isolated clones. This group of &#61537;-kafirins was not among the cluster but was 5&#8217; upstream of the cluster. This group had a higher content of the glutamine compared with the other 25 kDa group. The expression level was studied to show how each gene family contributed to the level of &#61537;- kafirins. QL41 and 296B were used for this study. From the studies it was shown that the 23 kDa &#61537;- kafirins genes were 20% more expressed than the 25 kDa. An attempt to identify suitable markers for the &#61537;-kafirins was investigated using RFLP and SSR analysis. Thirty-two different genotypes were utilised for this study. The observed variation indicated by cluster analysis (4-38%) clearly showed variation of the &#61537;-kafirins in genotype and within the kafirin genes as elucidated by the sequences in Chapter 4. Markers able to identify this variation could help in the selection of highly digestible mutants. Hence, there is potential for sorghum grain improvement using marker-assisted breeding. The need to identify a tissue specific promoter was essential, especially for a strong promoter that could drive expression in the endosperm of the monocots. A vector construct consisting of the &#61537;- kafirin promoter driving the GUS reporter genes was used for transient expression from QL41. This was assessed in the sorghum and barley calli, sorghum endosperm and leaves and corn endosperm. Tissue specific expression as well as higher levels of transient expression were seen using the &#61537;- kafirin promoter, compared with the ubiquitin promoter. Preliminary experiments have illustrated the potential use of a gene silencing mechanism that could enhance the digestibility of sorghum grain. The 25 kDa &#61537;-kafirin gene was used as the target for gene silencing using the mechanism of iRNA. Transformation constructs were developed using the throughput vector pSTARGATE in an effort to silence the 25 kDa &#61537;-kafirins. The characterisation of the &#61537;-kafirins has provided valuable information for future sorghum improvement research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sorghum bicolor, seed storage protein, prolamins, protein bodies</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184234</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Immediate effect of physical activity on the postural stability of older people</field><field name="creator">Thorlene Egerton</field><field name="description">Understanding the predisposing factors for older people falling is imperative as falls can lead to considerable medical and societal costs, loss of independence and reduced quality of life. In particular, it is important to understand more about the many possible intrinsic and extrinsic reasons why older people sometimes fail to maintain their postural stability and fall. Older people are increasingly being encouraged to maintain or increase their daily physical activity levels. Healthy older adults have been shown to have altered postural stability following high intensity physical activity; however it is not known whether postural stability is compromised during everyday levels of physical activity. If it were, it could expose them to greater risk of falling. The overall aim of this series of investigations was to determine whether postural stability was detrimentally affected immediately after moderate intensity physical activity. Five studies were undertaken. Study 1 was carried out to determine the typical duration of activity periods that occur during the daily lives of community-living older people. In this study, the activity period durations of older people living either at home or in an aged care facility were recorded over a continuous 72 hour period using an activity monitoring device. Study 2 determined the effect of an activity protocol, designed to be representative of routine daily activity of community-living older people, on clinical indicators of fatigue. These indicators included maximal voluntary torque from the knee extensor and hip abductor muscles, subjective feelings of fatigue and temporal and spatial gait variables. The physical activity protocol involved a series of tasks carried out continuously for 14 minutes, self-paced at moderate intensity. Tasks included walking, step-ups, mini-lunges and avoiding obstacles. The final three studies compared postural stability before and immediately after the moderate intensity physical activity protocol. Study 3 recorded centre of pressure (COP) displacement during quiet standing with feet together. Study 4 recorded forces and postural electromyographic (EMG) activity during a rapid forward step-up task. Study 5 recorded postural responses to a lateral waist-pull perturbation large enough to elicit a step response. Studies 2, 3 and 4 compared healthy young adults with healthy older and balance-impaired older adults, whilst the final study compared healthy young and old adults. Community-living older people were found to have a wide range of activity period durations and those living in aged care had significantly shorter activity periods compared to those living independently at home. As a result of the findings, an activity period duration of 14 minutes was considered representative of community-living older people&#8217;s physical activity exposure. In Study 2, immediately following the physical activity protocol, young, healthy old and balance-impaired older adults all showed no changes in leg strength. All groups felt generally tired and had sensations of local leg muscle fatigue but only the balance-impaired adults were still reporting feelings of fatigue 20 minutes after the activity ceased. This group were also the only group to show altered gait after the activity. Their cadence was reduced compared with before activity and remained reduced 20 minutes later. In quiet standing, all groups demonstrated larger COP displacement in the mediolateral direction following the physical activity. For the step-up task, all groups showed small improvements immediately following the physical activity. These included reductions in the duration of the weight-shift phase, lateral COP displacement during weight-shift and the stance leg hip abductor muscle onset times. Participants also showed a shift in COP position towards the stance side prior to the step following the physical activity. In the final study, the older participants used a cross-over step in response to the lateral perturbation more frequently after the activity than before. This response is a less optimal response compared with a faster and more stable single outward step. When older and younger participants did perform outward steps following the physical activity, they performed them as well as they did before activity. Small changes to some of the measures of postural stability were found during quiet standing, voluntary stepping and to the responses after a lateral perturbation following moderate intensity physical activity. These changes may have been due to the impact of subjective feelings of tiredness experienced by participants. The increased use of a cross-over step strategy to regain balance after a lateral perturbation among healthy older people may mean that older people are at greater risk of falling after physical activity. However, the findings from this series of studies do not convincingly support a clinically significant detrimental effect on older people&#8217;s postural stability immediately following routine daily physical activity. This thesis has begun to investigate the effect of physical activity at daily levels on older people&#8217;s postural stability, however further investigations are recommended.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ageing</field><field name="subject">Physical activity</field><field name="subject">Postural Stability</field><field name="subject">Fatigue</field><field name="subject">Balance</field><field name="subject">Gait</field><field name="subject">Strength</field><field name="subject">Electromyography</field><field name="subject">Activity monitoring</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184253</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationship between envy and workplace bullying</field><field name="creator">Donna-Louise McGrath</field><field name="description">This study reports on the development and revision of an instrument to measure the relationship between workplace bullying and envy, as reported by the perpetrator of bullying. In the pilot study, referred to as Phase A, measures of workplace bullying, direct envy and indirect envy were developed. The constructs of envy and bullying were captured without the undesirable labels of &#8216;bullying&#8217; and &#8216;envy&#8217;. The pilot instrument was administered to a random sample of 200 employees. A total of 74 questionnaires were returned, resulting in a 37% response rate. Psychometric analysis included Cronbach&#8217;s alpha and exploratory factor analysis. Written participant feedback was sought on question clarity and construct validity. The results indicated that the envy and bullying subscales had satisfactory internal reliability and construct validity and that the indirect participant-character methodology was the preferred measure of envy for the affect of anger. The relationship between envy and workplace bullying was investigated using Pearson product moment correlation coefficients. Results showed a positive relationship between envy and informal bullying. It was concluded that the instrument was a reliable and valid self-reported measure of envy and workplace bullying. The pilot instrument was adapted in Phase B of the study to improve its psychometric properties. Using the revised instrument, self-reported data on envy and workplace bullying were collected from a population of Australian workers in nursing, teaching and electrical trades. There were 1545 questionnaires distributed. A total of 413 usable questionnaires were returned, giving a response rate of 27%. Psychometric analysis included Cronbach&#8217;s alpha and confirmatory factor analysis. Gossip related behaviours were found to be related to a different construct than &#8216;bullying&#8217; and these items were deleted from the analysis. A one way between-groups analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc tests was performed to explore the impact of industry (nursing, teaching and electrical trades) on bullying scores. Results showed small yet significant between-industry differences for informal bullying, with significant moderate differences for total bullying. In Phase B of the study, the relationship between envy and workplace bullying was investigated for the sample (N = 413) and &#8216;high anger&#8217; envy groups, using Pearson product moment correlation coefficients. &#8216;High anger&#8217; was not measured as &#8216;overt aggression&#8217;, but as envious anger felt toward the possessor of superior traits. The major findings from this research were that envy had a positive significant (p &lt; .05) relationship with all types of workplace bullying: informal bullying, formal bullying and total bullying. Further, the correlations between envy and all types of workplace bullying were found to increase for &#8216;high anger&#8217; groups. Large (r &gt; .70) significant (p &lt; .05) correlations were found for some of the highest anger groups. As envious anger increased, the strength of the correlation between envy and workplace bullying increased. An important finding to emerge from this research was that it is the psychoanalytic view of envy, marked by a &#8216;feeling of envious anger at the possessor of superior traits&#8217;, which was most associated with all types of workplace bullying. The results demonstrated that the self-report study managed to overcome some of the methodological challenges of studying bullying from the perspective of the perpetrator and of measuring undesirable concealed emotions such as envy. Several recommendations for future research and preventative workplace practice arose from the findings of this study. Future research should apply the objective methodology employed in this study to longitudinal self-reported studies. Such studies could provide insight into whether bullying is a static or an escalating process. Related to this, future studies need to investigate why bullying, as reported by the perpetrators of bullying in this study, is either not deterred by organisations or not formally reported by targets. The role of organisations in monitoring and preventing workplace bullying and the apparent inadequacy of workplace bullying policies and internal grievance processes warrant further research. There needs to be greater awareness of the potential for organisations to elicit [harmful] envy through workplace &#8216;rewards&#8217;. Investigation of the &#8216;progression of envious feelings&#8217; at work may assist organisations to mitigate the escalation of envious feelings toward anger, which was found to be most associated with workplace bullying in this study. Importantly, organisations need to be aware of the potential for rewarded and talented workers to become targets of workplace bullying. As such, further workplace research is needed on narcissists, who envy those who receive more attention, praise or acknowledgement than themselves (Australian Government Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, 2007). Given the ubiquitousness of envy reported on in this study, the &#8216;spectrum&#8217; of narcissistic tendencies in the general population (Foster &amp; Campbell, 2007) should be measured.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Envy</field><field name="subject">workplace bullying</field><field name="subject">informal bullying</field><field name="subject">formal bullying</field><field name="subject">covert bullying</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184337</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measurement and Modelling of Swash Zone Bed Shear Stress</field><field name="creator">Matthew BARNES</field><field name="description">The development and testing of a shear cell for the purpose of measuring swash zone bed shear stress is presented. Direct measurements of bed shear stress were subsequently obtained using the shear plate in small, medium, and large-scale laboratory facilities. Measurements from both dam- break and bore-driven swash experiments are considered, covering a wide range of hydrodynamics and bed roughness. The dam-break problem is of interest here due to the theoretical analogy with the run-up of a solitary bore on a beach. Estimates of the flow velocities through the full swash cycle were obtained through numerical modelling and verified against measured velocity data. In conjunction, these data are used to calculate skin friction coefficients. The measurements indicate strong temporal and spatial variation in bed shear stress throughout the swash cycle, and a clear distinction between the uprush and backwash phase. For a single swash event, the maximum uprush bed shear stresses occur in the lower swash zone, within the range 0&lt;x/Rx&lt;0.3. The maximum backwash bed shear stresses also occur in the lower swash zone, and extend seaward of the initial bore collapse location. For a given cross-shore location the peak uprush bed shear stress is typically greater than the peak backwash bed shear stress by at least a factor two and up to a factor four. Local skin friction coefficients also indicate strong temporal and spatial variation. Furthermore, the behaviour of the local skin friction coefficient (back calculated from the measured bed shear stress using predicted, depth-averaged, flow velocities) over the swash cycle is inconsistent with the classical behaviour that is expected on the basis of the low Reynolds number flow. Smooth bed dam break and swash uprush friction coefficients appear to follow the general behaviour observed for smooth, turbulent open channel flow for an increasing Reynolds number. However, for a decreasing Reynolds number the behaviour of Cf differs from the steady flow relation. This is attributed the unsteady swash flow regime and flow history effects. It is expected that differences in flow history between the uprush and backwash have implications in terms of swash boundary layer growth and the resulting bed shear stress. A Lagrangian model for the swash boundary layer development is presented to consider these flow history effects. The model is based on the momentum integral approach for steady, turbulent, flat-plate boundary layers, with appropriate modifications to account for the unsteady flow regime. Fluid particle trajectories and velocity are computed and the boundary layer growth across the entire swash zone is estimated. Predictions of the bed shear stress agree well with the direct bed shear stress measurements and show a bias toward uprush sediment transport which has consistently been observed in measurements.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">swash zone, bed shear stress, shear plate, frition coefficient, sediment transport, beach morphody- namics, boundary layer</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184339</field></doc><doc><field name="title">POSTURAL STABILITY AND SPINAL MOVEMENT IN CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN</field><field name="creator">Nicola Mok</field><field name="description">Movement of different body segments is an essential component for the control of postural stability. Notably, balance impairment has been reported in individuals with chronic low back pain. Various impairments that are likely to affect postural control have been reported in this population, including proprioceptive deficits and altered control of movement at the lumbopelvic region. Although little is known about how movement of the lumbar spine contributes to postural control, spinal movement is likely to be part of the movement strategy when the multisegmental nature of the human body configuration is taken into consideration. The overall objective of this thesis was to investigate the changes in postural stability in individuals with chronic LBP, and the association with altered movement control at the lumbar spine. The control of postural stability was examined with different postural challenges while standing on either a flat surface or a short base. A short base was used to force the subjects to use a &#8220;hip strategy&#8221;; movement at the lumbopelvic region for postural correction. Kinematics of different body segments including the lumbar spine and hip were recorded to study the movement of the lumbopelvic region. In addition, ground reaction force data were collected with a force platform system to examine postural adjustments during various postural tasks. The studies showed that people with chronic low back pain have difficulty maintaining stance, with increased risk of overbalancing when standing on a short base without any perturbation. Altered motion of the lumbar spine was evident during both expected and unexpected postural perturbations, which indicated impairment of both anticipatory and feedback control of lumbar motion in individuals with chronic low back pain. In addition, subjects took longer to regain postural stability and made more postural adjustments during the recovery period after expected and unexpected perturbations. Together, the studies suggested significant contribution of changes in lumbar motion to postural impairment in people with chronic low back pain. In summary, these findings provide further evidence that spinal movement plays a critical role in the maintenance of postural stability, and altered control of movement affects the quality of postural control in individuals with chronic low back pain.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">low back pain,</field><field name="subject">postural control,</field><field name="subject">anticipatory postural adjustments,</field><field name="subject">movement control,</field><field name="subject">Balance</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184372</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computer-Assisted Vocabulary Workbench for Interpreters (CAVWI): Strategic vocabulary portfolio building for Chinese EFL student interpreters</field><field name="creator">Lily Lim</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interpreters</field><field name="subject">vocabulary</field><field name="subject">student training</field><field name="subject">technology software</field><field name="subject">portfolio</field><field name="subject">workbench</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184490</field></doc><doc><field name="title">INTERGENERATIONAL FINANCIAL TRANSFERS: FILIPINO MIGRANTS CARING FOR PARENTS OVERSEAS</field><field name="creator">Iris Lazzarini</field><field name="description">Abstract Recent estimates are that migrants send approximately US$300 billion in financial remittances from developed to developing countries annually and that such money is important at the micro and macro levels in relieving family poverty. As a migrant-receiving country with a culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) population, Australia has many migrants from developing countries who are part of this phenomenon. Little is known, however, about the purposes for which migrants send money home, the role it plays in intergenerational care and the perceptions of the impact of these payments on the recipients and on their own families in Australia. This study has a specific focus. It is interested in understanding the financial support provided to aged relatives in developing countries from Australian citizens. The term intergenerational financial transfers (IFTs) is used to distinguish money sent overseas by migrant adult children to parents or older relatives from general remittances. In Australian government accounting systems, remittances, or money sent to the home country by migrants, is collected as aggregate data, and it is therefore not possible to obtain a statistical understanding of how much money is being sent for specific purposes. This thesis explores the practice of making IFTs within one group of Australian citizens - Filipino migrants. Filipinos are one of the more numerous recent groups migrating to Australia from within its own geographic region, are known to send IFTs home, and are known to have good English skills that will facilitate research participation. The exploratory study uses in-depth interviews with a purposive, cross-sectional sample of 20 permanent Filipino migrants (10 female and 10 male). The interviews explore participants&#8217; current practices of sending money home to older relatives, the influences and motivation to send money over the life cycle, and the perceptions of the impacts of the practice on themselves and recipients. A thematic analysis of the transcribed data shows that sending money home is not only a migrant activity, since more than half the participants sent money home to parents before migrating to Australia. It also shows that this sample did not migrate to Australia primarily to make remittances, but for some, migration made it possible to do so. Cultural factors were the main motivation for making IFTs, followed by socio-economic circumstances of parents, and family values. No participant would consider abandoning their commitment and those who experienced difficulty in making IFTs over the life cycle were prepared to sell items or take out loans to continue their practice. The data analysis also showed that as well as females sending on average $500 per annum and males $1,000 per annum as cash or cheques through agents or banks, participants also purchased other one-off items, and sent substantial amounts of money for various emergency situations. Participants provided other forms of caregiving including practical care, gave ongoing psychological and emotional support, and sent large packages of goods home, thereby assisting parents with a wider variety of personal caregiving. On occasion participants co-operated with their siblings to provide a wider framework of family caregiving for their parents. IFTs are an important component of support for older people in many developing countries, and are made without expectation of financial return. The data showed that the practice of making IFTs was problematic for some participants at different stages of the life cycle. Because of the strong cultural values and obligations underpinning the practice, participants sometimes felt pressure to make IFTs from potential savings when, for example, school-age family expenses were high and had to be met; some women in their intercultural marriages who were unable to meet IFTs from their own earnings as their preferred option had to negotiate IFTs from household income. The thesis builds knowledge in the area of intergenerational financial transfers, transnational families and transnational caregiving for older people. It also adds depth to the understanding of the caregiving responsibilities and commitments to older people of some Australian citizens. This research adds an understanding of the practice of one group of migrants who send money home to ageing parents in the 21st century. It provides insight into current processes and practices and points to areas of policy where migrant Australian citizens might receive greater recognition for observing cultural obligations to care for parents and older relatives.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">16 Studies in Human Society</field><field name="subject">intergenerational financial transfers</field><field name="subject">migrant</field><field name="subject">migration</field><field name="subject">remittances</field><field name="subject">caregiving</field><field name="subject">parents and older relatives</field><field name="subject">influences and motivation</field><field name="subject">socio-economic conditions</field><field name="subject">impacts</field><field name="subject">social policy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184500</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical Modelling of the Plasma Membrane</field><field name="creator">Valeriu Dan Nicolau</field><field name="description">Many crucial cellular processes take place at the plasma membrane. The latter is a complex, two-dimensional medium exhibiting significant lateral structure. As a result, a number of non-classical processes, including anomalous diffusion, compartimentalisation and fractal kinetics take place at the membrane surface. The evaluation of various hypotheses and theories about the membrane is currently very difficult because no general modelling framework is available. In this thesis, we present a stochastic, spatially explicit Monte Carlo model for the plasma membrane that accounts for illmixedness, mobile lipid microdomains, fixed proteins, cytoskeletal fence structures and other interactions. We interrogate this model to obtain three classes of results, regarding (1) the effect of lipid microdomains on protein dynamics on the membrane (2) the effects of microdomains, cytoskeletal fences and fixed proteins on the nature of the (anomalous) diffusion on the membrane and (3) the effects of obstructed diffusion on reaction kinetics at the membrane. We find that the presence of lipid microdomains can lead to nonclassical phenomena such as increased collision rates and differences between long-range and short-range diffusion coefficients. Our results also suggest that experimental techniques measuring long-range diffusion may not be sufficiently discriminating and hence cannot be used to infer quantitative information about the presence and characteristics of microdomains. With regard to anomalous diffusion in particular, we find that to explain this phenomenon at the levels observed in vivo, a number of interactions are required, including (but not necessarily limited to) obstacle-induced diffusion and segregation, or exclusion from microdomains. The effects of these different interactions upon the nature of the diffusion appear to be approximately additive. Finally, we show that a widely used non-spatial method, the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm, can be modified to take into account anomalous diffusion and that this significantly increases its predictive accuracy. The model presented in this thesis is expected to be of future value in evaluating different models of cell surface processes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">membrane</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="subject">lipid rafts</field><field name="subject">anomalous diffusion</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184519</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ontogenetic changes in the visual system of the brown banded bamboo shark, Chiloscyllium punctatum (Elasmobranchii), with special reference to husbandry and breeding</field><field name="creator">Blake Harahush</field><field name="description">Developmental studies on elasmobranchs are challenging due to the difficulties in obtaining sufficient numbers of animals of different age cohorts. The brown banded bamboo shark, Chiloscyllium punctatum is a good model in this regard as it is abundant and readily available in the wild, is quick to mature, is frequently housed and bred in captivity and is a relatively small species of shark. Whilst there are important factors that must be considered when comparing the retinal development of animals raised in captivity to those caught from the wild, the use of C. punctatum represents an outstanding opportunity to study the development of the elasmobranch visual system from pre-hatching embryonic to adult life stages. In this study, the developing eye and retina of C. punctatum were studied using light and electron microscopy, electroretinography (ERG) and microspectrophotometry (MSP). To provide a source of early-stage animals, and to investigate the effects of environmental factors (such as temperature) on physical development, a captive breeding program was established at the University of Queensland. Sharks sourced from this facility were supplemented with animals bred at UnderWater World, Sea World and caught from the wild. Monitoring the fecundity, embryonic development, growth and viability of captive C. punctatum showed that females lay an average of 115.3 eggs, 38 of which were viable and 21.4% of which hatched. Embryos have an average gestation of 153 days post deposition (dpd; temp: 21 - 25&#186; C) and embryonic growth is most rapid from 99 dpd until hatching. The eye of C. punctatum develops early in embryogenesis, with visible optic vesicles bulging at 27 dpd. Recent advances in fixation and processing techniques for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have yielded improved levels of ultrastructural detail in a variety of tissue types. Consequently, in addition to conventional chemical fixation (CF) methods, the retina of C. punctatum was also processed using microwave chemical fixation (MCF) and high pressure freezing (HPF), and the resulting ultrastructure compared. Both MCF and HPF produced superior retinal ultrastructure compared to conventional CF, evidenced by higher resolution of ultrastructural detail and fewer artefacts. MCF provided the best, consistent ultrastrucutral results. By examining the time-course of retinal cell differentiation, it was found that ganglion and M&#252;ller cells are the first to differentiate, at approximately 81 dpd. The interneurons differentiate next, beginning with the amacrine cells (81 dpd), followed by the bipolar cells (101 dpd) and horizontal cells (124 dpd). The adult retina is duplex and rod and cone photoreceptors are differentiated and synaptic connections are formed by 124 dpd. Topographic analysis of retinal neuron sub-types reveals that C. punctatum undergoes rapid changes in ganglion cell distribution during embryogenesis. High levels of apoptosis, especially around the retinal periphery, result in relatively higher cell densities in the central retina, which progressively extend nasally and temporally to form a meridional band. C. punctatum develops a horizontal streak and shows only minor changes in topography during growth. Only basal levels of apoptosis are seen post-hatching. In the adult shark, the total ganglion cell number reaches 547,881. The mean and highest retinal ganglion cell densities reach a peak around hatching (3,228 cells mm-2 and 4,983 cells mm-2, respectively). Using measurements of lens focal length and ganglion cell density, the calculated maximum spatial resolving power (assuming a hexagonal mosaic) increases from 1.47 cycles degree-1 during embryogenesis to 4.29 cycles degree-1 in adults. The addition of a high ganglion cell density area within the visual streak and an increasing spatial resolving power over post-hatching development suggest an increased prey targeting and capture ability for this species. Using ERG, it is shown that C. punctatum becomes responsive to light at 127 dpd and light sensitivity peaks around the time of hatching, with a slight decrease post-hatching. C. punctatum maintains a flicker fusion frequency (FFF; an indicator for temporal resolution) at 7 - 22 Hz through juvenile stages), which is relatively low compared to other marine predators. ERG results suggest that this species is adapted to low light vision with low temporal resolution. The early differentiation, development and functionality of the visual system in C. punctatum allows for a period of synaptic maturation and potentially the ability of embryonic predator avoidance. The retina of C. punctatum contains a rod visual pigment with a wavelength of maximum absorbance (&#955;max) at 500 nm and cone visual pigment with a &#955;max at 532 nm; the &#61548;max values of these pigments do not change during development. Rod and cone outer segments differentiate at 113 days post deposition (dpd), lengthen during embryogenesis and accumulate pigment throughout life. Although the photoreceptors develop and differentiate well in advance of hatching, there is considerable variation in outer segment length and pigment density during embryogenesis, which suggests that these cells are developing up until hatching. C. punctatum does not appear to have the potential for colour vision based on the lack of two cone photoreceptor types each containing a visual pigment maximally sensitive to different parts of the visual spectrum, but appears specialised for dim-light contrast vision.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chiloscyllium punctatum</field><field name="subject">elasmobranch</field><field name="subject">retina</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">ontogenesis</field><field name="subject">captive breeding</field><field name="subject">husbandry</field><field name="subject">electron microscopy</field><field name="subject">electroretinogram</field><field name="subject">microspectrophotometry</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184524</field></doc><doc><field name="title">J. S. Bach's St. Matthew Passion: Vocal and Instrument Forces at its Birth and Resurrections</field><field name="creator">Su-hwei Liew</field><field name="description">In the centuries that have passed since the premiere of Johann Sebastian Bach&#8217;s St. Matthew Passion in Leipzig&#8217;s St. Thomas&#8217;s Church at the Good Friday service in 1727, the work has had a remarkable performance history. Despite the fact that it received a number of repeat performances during Bach&#8217;s own lifetime (in revised versions), the St. Matthew Passion was largely forgotten after the composer&#8217;s passing until Felix Mendelssohn &#8220;resurrected&#8221; it in Berlin in 1829 with the localSing-Akademie and the Philharmonische Gesellschaft. The latter performance created such a level of excitement and interest in musical circles that two repeat performances followed soon after, despite Mendelssohn&#8217;s absence from Berlin. In 1970, Nikolaus Harnoncourt&#8217;s groundbreaking Telefunken LP of the St. Matthew Passion with the period instrument band Concentus Musicus Wien was released, a recording that, above all, stood in stark contrast to the consistent growth in the size of choirs performing this work that had occurred over centuries since Bach&#8217;s first performance in 1727. As with Mendelssohn&#8217;s performance, Harnoncourt&#8217;s interpretation generated great interest in scholarly circles and among the listening public. This critical commentary examines the size and constitution of the vocal and instrumental forces of all three performances of the St. Matthew Passion, as well as the extent to which those of 1829 and 1970 adhered to what is known of Bach&#8217;s own practices. In addition to investigating the choices made by the respective musical directors in this respect, the reception of Mendelssohn&#8217;s and Harnoncourt&#8217;s performances will also be considered.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">st. matthew passion, historical performance practice, johann sebastian bach</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184526</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mesoporous carbon materials for energy storage onboard electric vehicles</field><field name="creator">Thomas Rufford</field><field name="description">Hydrogen is considered one of the best alternatives to fossil-fuels for the transportation sector because hydrogen can be burnt cleanly and efficiently in a fuel cell to drive an electric motor. However, due to the low density of H2 at ambient conditions the conventional H2 storage technologies (cryogenic liquid and compressed gas) cannot achieve energy densities comparable to to gasoline and diesel. A second energy storage challenge onboard electric fuel cell vehicles is fuel cell power management at peak current loads, which requires an auxiliary power source like a battery or supercapacitor. The development of efficient onboard energy storage systems for H2 and auxiliary power is critical to realisation of a hydrogen economy. Mesoporous carbons were investigated as H2 storage materials in composites with magnesium hydride (MgH2),and as electrode materials for electrochemical double-later capacitors. The mesoporous carbons were prepared by two methods: (1) from porous silica and alumina templates, and (2) by chemical activation of a waste carbon source (waste coffee grounds). The experimental approach targeted reducing the cost of mesoporous carbon preparation by using a cheaper template, where the cost of alumina template was one-fifth the cost of the silica template (at the laboratory scale), or by using a waste material as a carbon source. The alumina template was found to be suitable to produce a mesoporous carbon with an average pore size of 4.8 nm. Chemical activation of coffee grounds with ZnCl2 produced activated carbons with BET surface areas up to 1280 m2/g. Mesopore volume increased with ZnCl2 impregnation ratio, with mesopore size distributions in the range 2 - 20 nm. The theoretical H2 capacity of MgH2 is 7.6 % but MgH2 application in fuel cell vehicles is limited by slow hydrogenation kinetics and high temperatures (&gt; 573 K) for H2 release. Magnesium was impregnated on activated carbon fibres (ACF) and mesoporous carbon (prepared from silica and alumina templates) to improve H2 storage kinetics and thermodynamics by reducing the magnesium hydride particle size. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) studies showed that thermal decomposition of MgCl2 supported on ACF at 1173 K in N2 and H2 can produce a Mg-ACF composite. At 573 K and 2 MPa H2 pressure a Mg-ACF composite, containing 11.2 %wt Mg, showed improved H2 adsorption kinetics compared to bulk Mg powder, but the total capacity of the Mg-ACF composite was only 0.4 % wt H2. To achieve a target of 6 %wt for onboard H2 storage higher Mg loadings are required. Attempts to impregnate Mg in mesoporous carbon via the MgCl2 thermal decomposition process highlighted the difficulties of avoiding MgO formation, and show that MgH2 loaded carbon is unlikely to be a practical high density onboard H2 storage technology. Activated carbons from waste coffee grounds (CGCs) were used as electrode materials in electrochemical double-layer capacitors. The specific capacitance of CGCs was as high as 368 F/g in 1 mol/L H2SO4, with good capacitance retention at fast charge rates and stable cycling performance. The good electrochemical performance of CGCs is attributed to a porous structure featuring both micropores 0.5 - 1.0 nm wide, which are effective for double-layer formation, and small mesopores, which facilitate electrolyte transport at fast charge rates. The capacitance of CGCs is enhanced by pseudo-Faradaic reactions involving nitrogen and oxygen functional groups. At fast charge-discharge rates the CGCs had higher energy density and better stability than a commercial benchmark activated carbon (Maxsorb). The ZnCl2 activation process can be optimised to develop mesopores for improved capacitance at fast charge rates and capacitance in organic electrolytes. In 1 mol/L tetra ethyl ammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEABF4) / acetonitrile the CGC with the most mesopores, which was prepared with a ZnCl2 to coffee ratio of 5:1, has the highest capacitance at high power density. CGCs with greater mesopore content retained higher specific capacitance at fast charge-discharge rates as the mesopores acts as channels or reservoirs for electrolyte transport. An improved model for evaluation of contributions to capacitance from micropore surfaces and mesopore surfaces is proposed. From this model the double-layer capacitance of mesopores surface area was found to be about 14 &#956;F/cm2 and did not change considerably with increasing current load. The contribution of micropores to capacitance is dependent on the accessibility of ions to the micropores, and this accessibility is proportional to the mesopore surface area. An exponential function was found to describe the contribution of mesopores and micropore surfaces to capacitance. The effective double-layer capacitance of the micropore surface area drops at fast charge-discharge rates as a result of restricted ion transport, and this result highlights the importance of mesopores to retain energy density for high power supercapacitor applications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mesoporous Carbon</field><field name="subject">Activated Carbon</field><field name="subject">Hydrogen Storage</field><field name="subject">Magnesium</field><field name="subject">Electrochemical Double-Layer Capacitor</field><field name="subject">Coffee</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184527</field></doc><doc><field name="title">INTERACTIONS BETWEEN AUXIN AND STRIGOLACTONE IN THE CONTROL OF ARABIDOPSIS SHOOT BRANCHING</field><field name="creator">Alice Hayward</field><field name="description">Diversity in plant architecture is largely generated by the post-embryonic regulation of meristem initiation and activity. In a phenomenon known as apical dominance, the active growth of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) exerts significant inhibitory force on the outgrowth of axillary meristems (AMs) into shoot branches. The degree of branching in plants is a determinant of yield in many crop species and is carefully regulated to ensure that plants only branch at specific stages of development or in response to their environment. Apical dominance has been attributed to the action of the hormone auxin, produced in SAM tissues and transported downwards. A second hormone, cytokinin, acts antagonistically to auxin to promote branching. Nonetheless, the exact mechanism by which these hormones operate is still being elucidated and continued research suggested that novel signals are involved. The recent discovery that strigolactones, previously implicated in parasitic weed germination and mycorrhizal associations, are branching inhibitors supports the existence of additional signals controlling branching in plants. In garden pea (Pisum sativum) strigolactones are synthesised by the coordinated action of the carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase (CCD) family enzymes, RMS1 (RAMOSUS1) and RMS5. These are encoded by MAX4 (MORE AXILLARY GROWTH4) and MAX3 in Arabidopsis thaliana respectively. Mutants for MAX genes have increased amounts of auxin travelling in the polar auxin transport stream (PATS) of inflorescence stems but exhibit increased branching that is insensitive to inhibition by this auxin. Two hypotheses for the action of strigolactones have been presented. The first is that strigolactones modulate the levels of auxin transport proteins, preventing axillary buds from establishing an active auxin transport flow into the primary stem, which inhibits growth. The second is that strigolactones act downstream of auxin signalling to inhibit the action of outgrowth-promoters. Consistent with this latter hypothesis, in pea, rice (Oryza sativa) and petunia (Petunia hybrida), the expression of RMS1/MAX4 orthologues is auxin regulated. These genes are also regulated by feedback signalling in strigolactone pathway mutants and this is proposed to involve an additional novel signal. In Arabidopsis, however, research showed that MAX4 is not regulated by feedback or auxin in the shoot and placed doubt on the importance of this regulation for branching control. The strigolactone biosynthetic pathway offers a novel target for the manipulation of plant architecture and yield while controlling the germination of parasitic weed species that are detrimental to agriculture. Therefore, a greater understanding of the pathway and its regulators is beneficial. The majority of the research in this thesis pre-dates the discovery of strigolactones as the RMS/MAX-derived branching inhibitor, yet aimed to clarify the evolutionary conservation and functional importance of the regulation of strigolactone biosynthetic genes by auxin and feedback signalling in Arabidopsis. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that MAX3 and MAX4 are co-ordinately and systemically regulated by auxin and by feedback throughout development. Both auxin and feedback regulation required the AXR1/TIR1 auxin response pathway, which targets Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors for proteasomal degradation. In particular, correct degradation of the Aux/IAA protein IAA12 appears to be necessary for optimal MAX3 and MAX4 expression. Moreover this regulation affects strigolactone-dependent branching inhibition. Therefore it is proposed that auxin inhibits branching, in part, by positively regulating strigolactone synthesis. As feedback requires AXR1, this also suggests that increased auxin level and/or signalling in the PATS in conditions of reduced strigolactone signalling mediates feedback regulation of the strigolactone pathway. Consistent with this, microarray analysis revealed that in addition to the inflorescence, max mutants have increased global auxin-responsive gene expression associated with the PATS in the vegetative stage. The pea RMS1 gene was the first strigolactone pathway gene demonstrated to be auxin-regulated. Sequencing of the RMS1 promoter and comparative bioinformatic analysis with promoters of other strigolactone synthesis genes revealed a number of conserved, putative regulatory cis-elements that could mediate this regulation and cross-talk with additional branching cues. However a 2.5 kb fragment of the RMS1 promoter was not sufficient to drive transcriptional and translational fusions with GFP and the RMS1 coding region in Arabidopsis. The RMS1 coding region driven by the CAMV 35S promoter complemented the max4 mutant but did not affect branching induced by auxin-depleting treatments. Grafting studies with axr1 and iaa12 mutants, and decapitation and auxin-transport inhibition in max4 mutants, demonstrated that auxin signalling has a function in branching control independent from the regulation of strigolactone synthesis genes. Overall, data obtained herein was incorporated into current models for the interaction of the strigolactone pathway with auxin and cytokinin in the control of shoot branching. It is suggested that both strigolactone and auxin have the capacity to regulate the levels or distribution of each other in interlocking feedback loop that intersects with additional developmental, physiological and environmental cues for the precise control of axillary branching in plants.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MAX</field><field name="subject">RMS</field><field name="subject">BODENLOS/IAA12</field><field name="subject">Branching</field><field name="subject">Auxin</field><field name="subject">Strigolactone</field><field name="subject">Cytokinin</field><field name="subject">Pea</field><field name="subject">Arabidopsis</field><field name="subject">Transcription</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184528</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Philosophy of Project Management: An investigation into the prevalence of modern project management by means of an evolutionary framework</field><field name="creator">Whitty, Stephen J.</field><field name="description">Why are projects and project management so cool when managing projects is so problematic? This question is at the heart of this thesis which sets out to find answer using an evolutionary approach to the discipline. A conceptual evolutionary framework for investigation is developed, the heredity of the ideas and concepts that underpin project management are traced and their impact analysed, and a conceptual model of the project management environment is developed to demonstrate how individuals and corporations gain survival benefits from aspects of project management. To further investigate the evolutionary mechanisms that take place in the project management environment, the result of a phenomenological study are presented which show that various project management artefacts emotionally affect individuals, and that those individuals also use the emotional affects to emotionally manipulate others. The conclusions drawn from this investigation are that modern project management delivers cultural survival benefits to individuals and corporations, and its various behaviours and concepts are encoded genetically and memetically across our genes and Western culture. The memetic framework for project management contributes to the field by providing a means to debunk the &#8216;sacred cows&#8217; of project management; it brings new understandings of how the various ideals, tools and concepts of project management deliver benefits, and to whom; and it provides a agenda for evidence based practice and the democratisation of work where project management is inculcated into the various work domains such as Health, Art, Agriculture, Commerce, etc, rather than a standalone discipline.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">project management</field><field name="subject">Evolutionary Psychology</field><field name="subject">memetics</field><field name="subject">emotion</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184530</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical Methods for Fractional Differential Equations and their Applications to System Biology</field><field name="creator">Farah Abdullah</field><field name="description">Features inside the living cell are complex and crowded; in such complex environments diffusion processes can be said to exhibit three distinct behaviours: pure or Fickian diffusion, superdiffusion and subdiffusion. Furthermore, the behaviour of biochemical processes taking place in these environments does not follow classical theory. Because of these factors, the task of modelling dynamical proceses in complex environments becomes very challenging and demanding and has received considerable attention from other researchers seeking to construct a coherent model. Here, we are interested to study the phenomenon of subdiffusion, which occurs when there is molecular crowding. The Reaction Diffusion Partial Differential Equations (RDPDEs) approach has been used traditionally to study diffusion. However, these equations have limitations due to their unsuitability for a subdiffusive setting. However, I provide models based on Fractional Reaction Diffusion Partial Differential Equations (FRDPDEs), which are able to portray intracellular diffusion in crowded environments. In particular, we will consider a class of continuous spatial models to describe concentrations of molecular species in crowded environments. In order to investigate the variability of the crowdedness, we have used the anomalous diffusion parameter $\alpha$ to mimic immobile obstacles or barriers. We particularly use the notation $D_t^{1-\alpha} f(t)$ to represent a differential operator of noninteger order. When the power exponent is $\alpha=1$, this corresponds to pure diffusion and to subdiffusion when $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$. This thesis presents results from the application of fractional derivatives to the solution of systems biology problems. These results are presented in Chapters 4, 5 and 6. An introduction to each of the problems is given at the beginning of the relevant chapter. The introduction chapter discusses intracellular environments and the motivation for this study. The first main result, given in Chapter 4, focuses on formulating a variable stepsize method appropriate for the fractional derivative model, using an embedded technique~\cite{landman07,simpson07,simpson06}. We have also proved some aspects of two fractional numerical methods, namely the Fractional Euler and Fractional Trapezoidal methods. In particular, we apply a Taylor series expansion to obtain a convergence order for each method. Based on these results, the Fractional Trapezoidal has a better convergence order than the Fractional Euler. Comparisons between variable and fixed stepsizes are also tested on biological problems; the results behave as we expected. In Chapter 5, analyses are presented related to two fractional numerical methods, Explicit Fractional Trapezoidal and Implicit Fractional Trapezoidal methods. Two results, based on Fourier series, related to the stability and convergence orders for both methods have been found. The third main result of this thesis, in Chapter 6, concerns the travelling waves phenomenon modeled on crowded environments. Here, we used the FRDPDEs developed in the earlier chapters to simulate FRDPDEs coupled with cubic or quadratic reactions. The results exhibit some interesting features related to molecular mobility. Later in this chapter, we have applied our methods to a biological problem known as Hirschsprung's disease. This model was introduced by Landman~\cite{landman07}. However, that model ignores the effects of spatial crowdedness in the system. Applying our model for modelling Hirschsprung's disease allows us to establish an interesting result for the mobility of the cellular processes under crowded environmental conditions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Partial Differential Equations,</field><field name="subject">fractional differential equations</field><field name="subject">biological mathematics</field><field name="subject">systems biology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184532</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nanoparticles with Application in the Delivery of Nucleic Acids to Mammalian Cells</field><field name="creator">Katharina Ladewig</field><field name="description">Many biopharmaceuticals, already approved for sale or currently under development, are post-translationally modified proteins, such as recombinant monoclonal antibodies or recombinant hormones. These are generally expressed in continuous (stable) mammalian cell lines, which are capable of long-term, commercial-scale production of recombinant proteins of the highest complexity. Yet, the development of a stable cell line capable of expressing heterologous proteins is very costly and can take up to 9&#8211;15 months. Therefore, transient gene expression (TGE) in animal cells has become the method of choice for many researchers who wish to obtain small to moderate quantities (1-500 mg) of novel complex recombinant proteins for further functional and structural characterisation within weeks of cDNA discovery. TGE is more cost-effective than the time-consuming establishment of stable cell clones, but a key factor in ensuring that these transient systems have practical application is the availability of efficient and robust transfection agents/methods. While chemical transfection methods currently dominate transient systems, the underlying fundamentals such as the formation of DNA complexes or their mode of function are not fully understood and the characteristics of the complexes and their subsequent ability to transfect cells are variable. This often renders the development of a successful transfection protocol for a new cell line random and researchers frequently have to resort to a trial-and-error approach, testing different media and/or conditions during DNA complex formation, as well as having to fine-tune the cell culture regime pre-, during, and post-transfection. This thesis aimed to explore novel transfection agents and develop DNA complex structure/property&#8212;transfection efficiency relationships for these reagents. Two different chemical approaches to transient transfection were investigated: i) a recently suggested inorganic nanoparticle based transfection system which utilises the anion exchange capacity of nanoparticles of a particular family of anionic clays, layered double hydroxides (LDHs), and ii) a modified polyethyleneimine (PEI)-based system, which aimed to reduce the inherent cytotoxicity of high molecular weight (MW) PEI, which is a very effective transfection agent, by constructing high MW mimics from low MW building blocks that are linked to each other via biodegradable linkers such as azomethine groups. While the LDH nanoparticles failed to give satisfactory transfection results for plasmid DNA, they were able to functionally deliver smaller nucleic acids such as siRNA. A mechanism different to that currently accepted for the transfection of mammalian cells with plasmid DNA using LDH nanoparticles as carriers is proposed. The modified polymeric transfection agents were shown to result in significantly less cell death, while maintaining the ability to transfect mammalian cells with almost similar efficiency to that obtained with high MW polyethyleneimine. Generic DNA complex structure/property&#8212;transfection efficiency relationships were developed by systematically studying the influence of particle size and zeta potential on transfection results.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Transfection</field><field name="subject">Layered Double Hydroxide Nanoparticles</field><field name="subject">Polyethyleneimine</field><field name="subject">siRNA</field><field name="subject">plasmid DNA</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184541</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multi-Property Topology Optimisation with the Level-Set Method</field><field name="creator">Vivien Joy Challis</field><field name="description">We present a level-set algorithm for topology optimisation and demonstrate its capabilities and advantages in a variety of settings. The algorithm uses discrete element densities so that interpolation schemes are avoided and the boundary of the design is always well defined. A review of the level-set method for topology optimisation, and a description of the mathematical concepts behind the level-set algorithm are given in the introductory chapters. A compact Matlab implementation of the algorithm provides explicit implementation details for the simple example of compliance minimisation with a volume constraint. The remainder of the thesis presents original results obtained using the level-set algorithm. As a new application, we use topology optimisation to maximise fracture resistance. Fracture resistance is assumed to be related to the elastic energy released by a crack propagating in a normal direction from parts of the boundary that are in tension. We develop a suitable fracture resistance objective functional, derive its shape derivative and apply the level-set algorithm to simple examples. Topology optimisation methods that involve intermediate density elements are not suitable to solve this problem because the boundary of the design is not well defined. Our results indicate that the algorithm correctly optimises for fracture resistance. As the method is computationally intensive, we suggest simpler objective functionals that could be used as a proxy for fracture resistance. For example, a perimeter penalty could be added to the compliance objective functional in conjunction with a non-linear elasticity law where the Young's modulus in tension is lower than in compression. The level-set method has only recently been applied to fluid flow problems. We utilise the level-set algorithm to minimise energy dissipation in Stokes flows in both two and three dimensions. The discrete element densities allow the no-slip boundary condition to be applied directly. The Stokes equations therefore need only be solved in the fluid region of the design: this results in significant computational savings compared to conventional material distribution approaches. In order to quantify the computational savings the optimisation problems are resolved using an interpolation scheme to simulate the no-slip boundary condition. This significant advantage of the level-set method for fluid flow problems has not been noted by other authors. The algorithm produces results consistent with those obtained by other topology optimisation approaches, and solves large-scale three dimensional problems with modest computational cost. The first examples of three dimensional periodic microstructure design with the level-set method are presented in this thesis. The level-set algorithm is extended to deal with multiple constraints. This is needed so that materials can be designed with symmetry requirements imposed on their effective properties. To demonstrate the capabilities of the approach, unit cells are designed separately to maximise conductivity and bulk modulus with an isotropy requirement. The resulting materials have properties very close to the relevant Hashin-Shtrikman bounds. The algorithm is then applied to multifunctional material design: unit cells are designed to give isotropic materials that have maximum bulk modulus and maximum conductivity. Cross-property bounds indicate the near-optimality of the microstructures obtained. The design space of the problem is extensively explored with different coefficients of the conductivity and bulk modulus in the objective and different volume constraints. We hypothesise the existence of theoretically optimal single-scale microstructures with the topologies of the computationally optimised microstructures we have found. Structures derived from the Schwartz primitive (P) and diamond (D) minimal surfaces have previously been presented as good multifunctional composites. These structures are elastically anisotropic. Although they have similar conductivity, they have stiffness properties inferior to several of the isotropic optimised microstructures.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">topology optimisation</field><field name="subject">level-set method</field><field name="subject">material design</field><field name="subject">fracture</field><field name="subject">elasticity</field><field name="subject">conductivity</field><field name="subject">Stokes flow</field><field name="subject">shape derivatives</field><field name="subject">topological derivatives</field><field name="subject">Matlab</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184547</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Young people with Asperger Syndrome: Risk Factors and Cognitive-Behaviour Treatment for Emotional Disturbance</field><field name="creator">Lake-hui Quek</field><field name="description">Abstract Co-morbid emotional disturbances are not uncommon in individuals with Asperger syndrome (AS) especially during the tumultuous period of adolescence. The few empirical studies that exist have only examined treatment outcomes for anxiety and anger in individuals with AS during childhood but there are no available treatment studies for adolescents or adults. Therefore, this research project aimed to examine the efficacy of a modified cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT) program for emotional disturbance in young people with a diagnosis of AS. Firstly, it was important to establish the need for treatment by examining the prevalence and presentation of emotional disturbance in this population. Secondly, an investigation of the role of pessimistic attributional style, negative problem orientation and social competence as risk factors for emotional disturbance helped to determine the suitability of CBT. It was also essential that an existing CBT program was modified to suit the cognitive profile of young people with AS. Finally, the efficacy of a modified CBT program was evaluated in a pilot study and randomised controlled trial. In the first study, 68 young people with existing diagnosis of AS between the ages of 11 and 23 years completed a battery of measures that assessed for AS characteristics, emotional disturbances, risk factors, and cognitive ability. The results of this study indicated that approximately 21%, 20% and 40% of young people reported elevated levels of depression, anxiety, and anger symptoms respectively. Furthermore, approximately 60% of young people reported elevated levels on at least one of the emotional disturbance measures (i.e., depression, anxiety or anger symptoms), while 40% of adolescents reported elevated levels on at least two. Therefore, the study suggests that there is a need to develop evidence-based treatment for young people with AS. In addition, significant associations were found between pessimistic attributional style, negative problem orientation and social competence, and emotional disturbance. Multiple regressions suggested that these risk factors account for approximately 54%, 39% and 25% of variance in depression, anxiety and anger respectively. These results are consistent with the literature for typically developing young people, and thus, cognitive-behaviour therapy typically used to treat mood and anxiety disorders in the general population should be efficacious for the AS population. Furthermore, CBT has been shown to be efficacious in treating anxiety and anger problems in children with AS. Although there are no existing CBT programs targeting depression in young people with AS, there are numerous CBT programs for typically developing young people. One example is the Aussie Optimism Program (AOP), an Australian adaptation of the Penn Prevention program which has a strong evidence-base for treating depression. Based on the AS literature, the program was modified to suit the cognitive profile of young people with AS. These modifications include providing affective education, using visual materials, small groups with high therapist to adolescent ratio, and other modifications to assist learning. Study Two piloted the modified program with three young people with AS. The pilot study provided some evidence that the modified Aussie Optimism reduced symptoms of emotional disturbance, but the sample size was too small to obtain clear results. In addition, observations from the pilot study were used to further modify the CBT program, which enhanced the structure and delivery of the program. The final modified CBT program consisted of six 2-hour sessions teaching young people to identify emotions and discriminate between different levels of emotional intensity; to cope with emotions; to identify and challenge negative thoughts; and to solve problems. Finally, a randomised controlled trial was used in Study Three to examine the efficacy of the modified CBT in treating depression in young people with AS. Given the high co-morbidity of emotional disturbance, the study also tested the efficacy of CBT program in reducing symptoms of anxiety and anger. Forty-four young people with AS were randomly allocated to the intervention (n = 21) or the waitlist control (n = 23). The results of Study Three demonstrated that young people with high levels of depression and anger symptoms initially showed a significant reduction after the intervention, compared with the waitlist control group. Although anxiety levels reduced from time 1 to time 2 for the intervention group, the pattern of results was not statistically significant. Reliable change index (RCI) indicated that young people with high levels of symptoms at Time 1 showed meaningful clinical changes across measures of depression, anxiety and anger (parent and adolescent report) only in the intervention group (42-83%), but not in the waitlist control group (8-12%). Results in Study Three suggest that CBT modified to suit the cognitive profile of AS is efficacious in reducing depression and anger symptoms. Some of the methodological limitations of this study include a small sample size, attrition, participant variability, and a lack of longer-term follow-up. Despite these methodological limitations, these three studies provided strong evidence for the efficacy of CBT in treating emotional disturbance in young people with AS by establishing the need for an intervention, identifying the importance of the risk factors targeted by CBT, and demonstrating the efficacy of a modified CBT in reducing symptoms of emotional disturbance, specifically depression and anger, using a randomised controlled trial.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asperger syndrome</field><field name="subject">Adolescence</field><field name="subject">depression</field><field name="subject">anxiety</field><field name="subject">anger</field><field name="subject">cognitive-behaviour therapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184562</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Risk assessment model for the custodial transfer of mined land to grazing</field><field name="creator">Robert Maczkowiack</field><field name="description">Open cut coal mining in the Bowen Basin of central Queensland had disturbed in excess of 55,000 ha by the turn of the 21st century and 72,000 ha by 2006. Strong export demand in recent years (since approximately 2000) has led to greater production from existing mines and to a proliferation of new ones. Therefore, over the ensuing decades, the level of mining activity can be expected to increase substantially the areas of erstwhile agricultural land that are disturbed. As mines exhaust their resources, companies will be obliged to achieve acceptable end uses for the various domains at those sites. The possibility of having successfully rehabilitated domains at selected sites certified on a progressive basis holds some appeal. While all stakeholder groups find a return of the land to its prior use (extensive cattle-grazing) an appealing goal, mining companies walk a tight-rope. The legislation under which the early mines were established does not bind them as tightly to the environmentally friendly outcomes as applies to new mines. Nonetheless, recent legislative trends as well as companies&#8217; own policies, encourage them to exceed society&#8217;s environmental expectations. Regardless of the end use that is designated, relinquishment is permitted only subject to a satisfactory assessment of the risks to its sustainability. Cattle-grazing is considered as a suitable end use, partly because the return of mined land to its prior use is preferred to its designation to some other use and partly because cattle could serve to reduce the bulk of pasture growth that occurs at some sites, reducing the risk of erosion if an intense fire were to occur followed by heavy rain. Graziers&#8217; primary motivation for seeking tenure of mined land is financial. Factors that determine both a site&#8217;s productivity and its commercial &#8216;worthwhileness&#8217; are examined in this research. The major focus of this research however, is the style of management that the custodial grazier may employ. Since any future custodian is likely to be a local landholder (perhaps the grazier family from whom the land was originally acquired for mining some decades earlier), it is the management style of local farmers that is of primary interest. Some graziers use the land more intensively than others: some with more sensitivity than others. Since the reconstructed landscape is inherently more fragile than undisturbed land, differences in management style could be critical to the sustainability of grazing. Factors driving, or at least being associated with, farmers&#8217; land management decisions were identified from prior research as draft components of a risk assessment model for grazing. A survey of the characteristics and circumstances of Bowen Basin graziers was then conducted with a view to modelling their influence on graziers&#8217; land management style. The survey ascertained the prior probabilities among the target graziers of the elements being modelled. An estimate of the role of these factors in shaping land management decisions was then obtained by eliciting the opinions of industry experts. These processes allowed development of a predictive model that estimates the likelihood of conservative and sensitive land management under various scenarios of site characteristics and grazier-based factors. Output from the model showed that the capital circumstances of a grazier&#8217;s business have an influence over the predicted management style of 25% of the difference between best-case and worst-case scenarios. There is a 17% greater likelihood of low-risk grazing where a grazier strongly wants tenure of the land for reasons that go beyond financial gain. The grazier&#8217;s underlying values and attitudes to land management account for a further 14%, followed by the operational structure of the business (12%), and the external climatic and economic environment (9%). Interventions that mining companies could implement to increase the likelihood of low-risk management has an influence of 23%. The credibility of the model&#8217;s output was evaluated by reference to real-life experiences of graziers who have managed cattle on mined land and their miner counterparts. Consistency of opinion among the consulted experts also contributed to the confidence that can be placed in the model&#8217;s findings. The model identifies the sources of risk if currently available mined land is used for grazing. It improves understanding of the situation in a holistic manner, and predicts the likelihood of low-risk grazing management under scenarios of interest to the user. The model identifies actions that mining companies could take to reduce risks associated with graziers&#8217; management style. The model may also guide future rehabilitation work by highlighting features of rehabilitation that would make them more suited to commercially feasible and low-risk cattle production &#8211; or by purposefully and transparently planning for cattle-grazing not to be the designated end use.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bayesian Networks</field><field name="subject">land management behaviour</field><field name="subject">Bowen Basin</field><field name="subject">decision support</field><field name="subject">systems analysis</field><field name="subject">post-mining land use</field><field name="subject">mined land rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">expert opinion</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184570</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relatedness, host specificity and richness of the genus Ceratomyxa (Myxozoa: Myxosporea) in teleost fishes</field><field name="creator">Nicole Gunter</field><field name="description">The genus Ceratomyxa Th&#233;lohan, 1892 is one of the largest myxozoan genera, the species of which almost always infect the gall bladder of marine teleosts. Although there are over 180 species known globally, prior to this study only three had been described from Australia. This study explores the systematics, host specificity and species richness of Ceratomyxa species from a diverse range of Queensland marine fishes. The first part of this thesis deals with the issues associated with spore based taxonomy and incorporates the first molecular studies to investigate host specificity and radiation in three common families of Great Barrier Reef (GBR) fishes. Twenty-two new species were described in these chapters, and although they were superficially similar in morphology all were genetically distinct. A focus on Ceratomyxa spp. infecting labrid, pomacentrid and serranid fish revealed tight host specificity of parasite species, confirmed the presence of multiple parasite species in a single host and revealed that no parasite radiation had occurred that could be associated with co-evolution with host families. Exploration of intra- and inter-specific variation by sequencing of multiple replicates from host/parasite combinations allowed interpretation of species boundaries within the system. Ten additional species described in Chapter 5 supported the findings from the labrid, pomacentrid and serranid studies but broadened the host range studied. In total 32 Ceratomyxa species were described from Queensland fishes increasing the number of described species in the genus by 15%. This study also reports on undescribed species collected from a further 70 host species and broadens the known host range to seven families of fishes. A checklist of bivalvulidans from marine teleosts in Australia is compiled of described and undescribed species and highlights the abundance of Ceratomyxa relative to other gall bladder dwelling myxosporeans. A phylogeny of the Ceratomyxa based on SSU rDNA analyses explored the taxonomic integrity of the genus. In general, the morphological diagnostic characters that divide the Myxozoa into genera are not well supported by molecular phylogenetic analyses. The relationship between 42 Ceratomyxa spp. and 36 other marine myxosporeans was examined using Bayesian inference, maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony. Results indicate Ceratomyxa is one of the most cohesive lineages within the Myxozoa and that the freshwater fish parasite, C. shasta, does not represent an independent lineage as suggested in previous studies. The strict host specificity of Ceratomyxa species prompted the investigation of species richness on the GBR. Species accumulation curves were used to explore species richness by using Choa2 and Jackknife1 estimators. The estimates suggested Ceratomyxa is almost as rich as their teleost hosts and that 1,600 species could be present on the GBR and as many as 15,000 species may exist globally. As an unexpected result, Ceratomyxa may be the richest metazoan genus in the sea. In light of what the study revealed, a revision of a second genus within the family Ceratomyxidae, Leptotheca, is presented. The boundaries between Ceratomyxa and Leptotheca were unclear. The diagnostic characters that separate these genera (length to thickness ratios) were found to be plastic and the type species of Leptotheca ultimately fitted the diagnosis for Ceratomyxa. To eliminate confusion between these genera and also between Sphaerospora and Leptotheca, the genus Leptotheca was considered invalid, with all species appropriately assigned to other genera based on morphological and biological characters and supported by genetic evidence.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Myxosporea</field><field name="subject">Ceratomyxa</field><field name="subject">Systematics</field><field name="subject">Host Specificity</field><field name="subject">Richness</field><field name="subject">SSU rDNA</field><field name="subject">phylogeny</field><field name="subject">Great Barrier Reef</field><field name="subject">Fishes</field><field name="subject">Parasitology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184573</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multi-Objective Design Optimisation of a Class of Parallel Kinematic Machines</field><field name="creator">Ilya Tyapin</field><field name="description">One of the main advantages of the Gantry-Tau machine is a large accessible workspace\footprint ratio compared to many other parallel machines. The Gantry-Tau improves this ratio further by allowing a change of assembly mode without internal link collisions or collisions between the links and the moving TCP platform. In this Thesis some of the features of the Gantry-Tau structure are described and results are presented from the analysis of the kinematic, elastostatic and elastodynamic properties of the PKM. However, the optimal kinematic, elastostatic and elastodynamic design parameters of the machine are still difficult to calculate and this thesis introduces a multi-objective optimisation scheme based on the geometric approach for the workspace area, unreachable area, joint angle limitations and link collisions as well as the functional dependencies of the elements of the static matrix and the Laplace transform to define the first resonance frequency and Cartesian and torsional stiffness. The method to calculate the first resonance frequency assumes that each link and universal joint can be described by a mass-springdamper model and calculates the transfer function from a Cartesian (TCP) force or torque to Cartesian position or orientation. The geometric methods involve the simple geometric shapes (spheres, circles, segments, etc) and vectors. The functional dependencies are based on the properties between the kinematic parameters. These approaches are significantly faster than analytical methods based on the inverse kinematics or the general Finite Elements Method (FEM). The reconfigurable Gantry-Tau kinematic design obtained by multi-objective optimisation gives the following features: &#8226; Workspace/footprint ratio more than 3.19. &#8226; First resonance frequency greater than 48 Hz. &#8226; Lowest Cartesian stiffness in the workspace 5N/&#956;m. &#8226; The unreachable space in the middle of the workspace is not detected. &#8226; No link collisions. The results show that by careful design of the PKM, a collision free workspace without the unreachable area in the middle can be achieved. High stiffness and high first resonance frequency are important parameters for the the Gantry-Tau when used in industrial applications, such as cutting, milling and drilling of steel or aluminium and pick-and-place operations. These applications require high static and dynamic accuracy in combination with high speed and acceleration. The optimisation parameters are the support frame lengths, actuator positions,endeffector kinematics and the robot&#8217;s arm lengths. Because of the fast computational speed of the geometric approaches and computational time saving of the methods based on the functional dependency, they are ideal for inclusion in a design optimisation framework, normally a nonlinear optimisation routine. In this Thesis the evolutionary algorithm based on the complex search method is used to optimise the 3-DOF Gantry-Tau.

Theory and empirical research from the emotion, motivation, and personality literatures was integrated to develop a multilevel model of states, traits, and situational factors as predictors of task performance. Data from five studies were analysed using single- and multi-level techniques to test the hypothesised model of relationships. The findings are reported within three manuscripts, which comprise the body of this thesis. Manuscript 1 presents validation evidence for the psychometric instruments used to measure the self-regulatory components of the model. Three studies (N = 758) were conducted to examine the nomological network of cognitive and affective regulation. In parallel, two new self-report scales were developed to operationalise these constructs within a repeated measures paradigm. The three studies demonstrated that the new cognitive and affective regulation scales were uniquely associated with other self-regulatory, personality, affective and achievement variables at the intra-individual and inter-individual levels. Study 1 provided evidence for the unidimensionality, internal consistency, and construct validity of each scale. Study 2 replicated and extended construct validity evidence using a different sample and performance domain. Study 3 established the utility of each scale for assessing intra-individual variability in cognitive and affective regulation, and their ability to predict performance within individuals. In sum, the three studies suggested that the new measures of cognitive and affective regulation were psychometrically adequate for use in model testing. Manuscripts 2 and 3 tested the intra-individual relationship between state affect and task performance, with a focus on the moderating effects of trait affect and task difficulty (Manuscript 2), and the mediating effects of cognitive and affective regulation (Manuscript 3). Each manuscript analysed different portions of data from two laboratory experiments (N = 182). In each experiment, participants performed multiple trials of an air-traffic control simulation that varied in task difficulty at the inter-individual (Study 4) or intra-individual (Study 5) level. Trait positive and negative affect were measured before the task, whereas state positive and negative affect, cognitive and affective regulation, and task performance were measured at repeated intervals over practice. In Manuscript 2, hierarchical linear modelling demonstrated that state positive affect was positively related, whereas state negative affect was negatively related, to task performance at the intra-individual level of analysis. As hypothesised, the strength of these affect-performance relationships was significantly moderated by trait affect and task difficulty. In both studies, the positive intra-individual relationship between state positive affect and performance was stronger for individuals with high (versus low) trait positive affect, particularly when task difficulty was high (versus low). In contrast, the negative intra-individual relationship between state negative affect and performance only emerged for individuals with low (versus high) trait negative affect, regardless of the level of task difficulty. In Study 4, the intra-individual relationship between state negative affect and task performance was also more pronounced when task difficulty was high (versus low). In Manuscript 3, multilevel multiple-mediation modelling demonstrated that cognitive regulation significantly mediated the intra-individual relationship between state positive affect and performance in both studies, alongside the intra-individual relationship between state negative affect and performance in Study 4. Unexpectedly, affective regulation failed to mediate either of these affect-performance relationships. However, state positive affect was positively related to affective regulation in both studies, whereas state negative affect was positively related to affective regulation in Study 5. Overall, this thesis makes theoretical, empirical and methodological contributions to understanding how affect relates to performance at the intra-individual level of analysis; and for whom, when, and why these relationships emerge. Within a multilevel framework, it integrates interdisciplinary perspectives to identify the affective determinants of performance from two levels of analysis. The results demonstrate that state positive and negative affect can differentially predict intra-individual variability in task performance, and that these effects may a) depend on trait affect and task difficulty; and b) be partially explained by cognitive regulation. These findings emphasise the importance of adopting a multilevel, repeated measures paradigm to examine how affective states, traits, and task demands interactively predict task performance. There is scope for extending this research further by investigating a broader range of moderating and mediating constructs. Practical implications and directions for future research are discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">17 Psychology and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="subject">affect, task performance, self-regulation, cognitive regulation, affective regulation, task difficulty, multilevel analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184578</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantifying the ecological values of brigalow regrowth for woodland birds: a hierarchical landscape approach</field><field name="creator">Michiala Bowen</field><field name="description">The conversion of native forests to pastures and crops is one of the most extensive causes of deforestation worldwide. Concomitant with agricultural landscape modification are the processes of habitat loss and fragmentation, which are major causes of species&#8217; extinctions, population declines and altered ecosystem functions. However, in many tropical, sub-tropical and temperate regions, abandoned agricultural lands are reverting to regrowth or secondary forest, which represents an important opportunity for passive landscape restoration. Regrowth may be particularly important in highly modified landscapes, where the area of mature forest may be insufficient to support viable plant and animal communities without some form of restoration. Some studies of fauna populations in regrowth forest have found recovery of species richness within several decades, although recovery of species composition may take at least 100 years and some species may be permanently lost. While these findings are encouraging, they generally fail to account for the landscape context in which regrowth occurs and focus mainly on tropical forests. The aim of this thesis was to advance the understanding of fauna recovery in regrowth forests on abandoned agricultural land by: i) comparing woodland bird communities in a replicated chronosequence of semi-arid sub-tropical regrowth forests; and ii) quantifying how the ecological values of regrowth habitat vary among stand-, patch- and landscape-levels of ecological organisation. A review of 68 studies of fauna recovery in regrowth forests, revealed that current knowledge is limited by the predominance of studies conducted: in tropical rainforests; with minimal replication of sites; in landscapes within proximity of large tracts of relatively undisturbed mature forests; and with limited consideration of the influence of the spatial context on fauna recovery in regrowth forest. This study makes a significant contribution to understanding fauna recovery in regrowth forests by quantifying the recovery of estimated bird species richness to levels similar to mature forest, within a period of 30-60 years, in highly modified semi-arid agricultural landscapes in sub-tropical Australia. An ordination of the similarity in species composition among forest types also suggested that after 30-60 years regrowth bird communities are more similar to mature brigalow forest than the younger regrowth. This is important for the recovery of brigalow ecosystems, an endangered ecological community where regrowth is currently given minimal protection from further clearing. Comparisons of the importance of habitat attributes using model averaging and hierarchical partitioning of generalised linear models of the species richness of woodland birds showed that bird species richness was positively associated with patch age, and that stand-level factors such as grazing disturbance and the abundance of mistletoes (Amyema spp.) were also important. The spatial context of vegetation patches (size, shape and isolation) was equally important for bird species richness, with more species of woodland dependent, nectar/frugivores and non-ground foraging insectivores occurring in less modified landscape contexts, and the converse for generalist species, ground foraging insectivores and granivores. While a number of woodland dependent bird species known to be in decline in temperate woodlands of southern Australia were absent or rare in regrowth forests, several species (e.g., eastern yellow robin) also occupied regrowth habitats. This finding suggests that these more sensitive species may respond positively to landscape restoration through targeted retention of brigalow regrowth. The landscape-level amount of forest varied in importance among regrowth age classes and bird groups. In general, the amount and number of mature forest patches in the landscape were of lower importance than local attributes. However, the amount of mature forest and old regrowth (&gt; 30 years) in the landscape did have an important positive influence on the number of woodland bird species and species&#8217; abundance; suggesting that regrowth is making an important contribution to landscape recovery in the study area. Mistletoe abundance was strongly dependent on particular species of frugivores for seed dispersal (e.g., mistletoebird, spiny-cheeked honeyeater and painted honeyeater), and varied considerably among three sub-regions of the study area. In general, mistletoe abundance increased in linear patches and more highly modified landscapes but was also dependent on the abundance of seed dispersers and brigalow stand condition. These findings suggest that narrow linear patches in brigalow landscapes can have important conservation values for woodland birds. The study outcomes have important implications for research and management of regrowth vegetation, both within Australia and internationally. From an international perspective, the study highlights the need for greater consideration of the importance of regrowth forest in a landscape context for conserving and restoring fauna communities. From an Australian perspective, the study provides important baseline information for the conservation and management of woodland bird habitat in fragmented brigalow landscapes. Prior to this research, very little was known on the spatial ecology of woodland birds in the region. The study highlights the important conservation values of small and often linear mature brigalow patches for woodland birds and the considerable potential for restoration of habitat for a diverse range of species through the retention of regrowth vegetation. In particular, the research outcomes suggest that targeting the retention of regrowth towards increasing the size and reducing the isolation of mature brigalow forests may be an effective strategy to maximise biodiversity benefits. Brigalow regrowth stands will need to be retained for at least 60 years and probably longer to maintain viable woodland bird communities. For this to happen on a regional-scale, brigalow regrowth needs to be given greater recognition for potential biodiversity benefits either within a legislative framework or by incentive schemes to promote the long term persistence of regrowth habitat within the landscape.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">05 Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">land abandonment</field><field name="subject">Regrowth</field><field name="subject">fauna recovery</field><field name="subject">woodland birds</field><field name="subject">agricultural landscape</field><field name="subject">Habitat Loss</field><field name="subject">habitat fragmentation</field><field name="subject">spatial pattern</field><field name="subject">Acacia harpophylla</field><field name="subject">brigalow</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184589</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Girl without hands: extract from the manuscript of a novel. The Maiden without hands: from folktale and fairy ale to contemporary novel</field><field name="creator">Melissa Ashley</field><field name="description">The Girl without Hands: From Folktale and Fairy Tale to Contemporary Novel By Melissa Jane Ashley Abstract The major component of the thesis is an extract from the manuscript, The Girl without Hands, a novelised interpretation of the folktale and fairy tale, The Maiden without Hands. The novel is composed of three books, with point of view structured as shifting third person; most of the story is narrated by the central character, Marina Fischer. The manuscript deploys a variety of fairy tale and folktale related literary techniques, including magic realism, intertextuality, framing, and fantasy. Events span a period of eight years, the action set in rural and urban parts of Queensland and Victoria. On an unsupervised picnic with friends, fourteen year old Marina Fischer&#8217;s twin sister Sonia suffers a fatal head injury. Grief-stricken and self-blaming, Marina reacts to the trauma by losing all feeling and movement in her hands. Six months following the accident, Marina seems on the verge of recovery; she attends regular therapy and is protected by her loyal friends, siblings Amelia and Sammy Jones. However, the patina of stability begins to crack when Marina is confronted at the year ten formal by Sonia&#8217;s former associates, Kylie Bates and Jody Cutter, also present at her death. Distraught and upset, Marina flees the dance in Jody&#8217;s older brother&#8217;s car. Seven years later Marina meets Matt Soverign, a gifted hypnotist, who tries to help her regain movement in her hands. They sleep together and Marina unexpectedly falls pregnant. Their son Tristram is born while Matt attends an interstate conference. Thinking a child would help her hands to heal, Marina becomes depressed when she continues to suffer from paralysis. She begins to dwell on memories of her sexual assault the night of the school dance, slowly losing touch with reality. But a phone call from her estranged friend, Amelia Jones, shakes Marina out of her stasis. Her close mate Sammy, who now lives in Melbourne, has fallen dangerously ill. With her relationship in pieces, Marina purchases train tickets for herself and Tristram and embarks upon a spontaneous&#8212;though much delayed&#8212;journey to reconcile the past. The critical component of the thesis is an essay entitled &#8220;The Maiden without Hands: From Folktale and Fairy Tale to Contemporary Novel&#8221;. Chapter one, &#8220;The Tale is Not Beautiful if Nothing is Added to It,&#8221; is a literary survey of cross-cultural folktale and fairy tale variants of the 1200 year old narrative, The Maiden without Hands. I explore academic debate regarding the literary fairy tale&#8217;s indebtedness to the oral folktale, discussing Susan Stewart&#8217;s notion of the &#8216;distressed text&#8217; and Lewis Seifert&#8217;s theory of &#8216;nostalgic recuperation.&#8217; Chapter two, &#8220;Then the Devil Will Take Me Away,&#8221; undertakes a close reading of the Grimm Brothers&#8217; influential but controversial 1857 re-write of The Maiden without Hands narrative. I suggest that Wilhelm Grimm&#8217;s suppression of the &#8216;unnatural father&#8217; episode, found in the traditional folktale, aided the story&#8217;s survival in and beyond the nineteenth century, when such themes became taboo. I explore how the Grimms&#8217; aesthetic revisions of folk material&#8212;to make them appeal to a middle class audience, including children&#8212;helped proliferate stereotyped representations of females and femininity in classic fairy tales. These depictions, I argue, often cause ambivalence in contemporary female readers, however they also instigate creative revisionary projects (such as my own), which seek to explore the residual energy contained in fairy tale texts, while at the same time destabilising their sexual stereotyping. In the last chapter, &#8220;The Only Thing She Doesn&#8217;t Have is Arms,&#8221; I discuss how extensive research into the many incarnations of The Maiden without Hands altered my understanding of the narrative&#8217;s symbols, tropes and metaphors, leading to significant changes to the plot of my novel. Citing examples from my text, The Girl without Hands, and comparing and contrasting them with excerpts from variants of the folktale and fairy tale, I analyse my creative interpretation of The Maiden without Hands&#8217; major themes: loss and lack; sexual assault and violation; creativity and writing; and, finally, healing and wholeness.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">19 Studies in Creative Arts and Writing</field><field name="subject">Fairy tale</field><field name="subject">Folktale</field><field name="subject">The Girl without Hands</field><field name="subject">Creative Writing</field><field name="subject">Novel</field><field name="subject">Conversion Disorder</field><field name="subject">Gender</field><field name="subject">Sexuality</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184596</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study of languages and cultures in contact among Iranian female immigrants in Australia</field><field name="creator">Maryam Mohammad Hassan-Jamarani</field><field name="description">Migration is an established phenomenon in today&#8217;s world. However, there has been only a relatively small amount of research on Iranian migrants in Australia, and in particular female Iranian migrants. By studying 15 first-generation Iranian Muslim women migrants&#8217; perceptions of their immigration to Australia and their difficulties in adjusting to the new culture, this study addresses four objectives: first, the extent of modification in religious identity; second, attitudes towards cultural maintenance; third, attitudes towards language maintenance; and fourth, attitudes towards gender role maintenance. The present study contributes to these underdeveloped areas of study on Iranian migrant women in Australia. This research involves a questionnaire and extensive interviews with the subjects. On the basis of a quantitative analysis of the questionnaire data, and a qualitative content analysis of the interviews, the study investigates the effects of immigration and a change of sociocultural context on the attitudes of the participants towards maintaining or modifying different aspects of their identity, namely the religious, cultural, linguistic and gender aspects. In doing so, we examine, in particular, the influence of the participants&#8217; levels of English language proficiency on their attitudes towards change in these four aspects of their identity. Berry&#8217;s Acculturation Model (1997) and its extended version, as proposed by Navasa and her colleagues (2005), are the theoretical frameworks adopted in this research. The present study tests the participants&#8217; responses against Berry&#8217;s model. The two issues explored in this work are: a) identifying the phase in Berry&#8217;s Acculturation Model in which the participants are located, with respect to the above-mentioned aspects of their identity; and b) examining the effect of English language proficiency, which emerges as a major factor, on the acculturation process of the participants. The findings show that there is a need to review the existing acculturation models, since Berry&#8217;s original model, and its enhancement by Navasa et al., are unable to explain and/or predict the acculturation situation of the migrant women in this study. A new model is therefore proposed &#8211; the Sociolinguistically Enhanced Acculturation Model (SLEAM), based on Berry&#8217;s original model, in which the impact and significance of the role of host language proficiency as the most important factor in the acculturation of migrants is integrated into the structure of the model. The current study is broadly located at the intersection of Sociolinguistics, in so far as sociocultural issues involving language and the use of language are concerned, and Migrant Studies, since the informants are migrant women. More narrowly, the study fits within the boundaries of Sociolinguistics of Identity. By this, we mean the study of identity in a sociocultural context, primarily through the instrumentality of language. The study further relies on the literature from the two fields of Acculturation and Gender Studies. The findings of this work are relevant to the fields of Sociolinguistics, Intercultural Communication, Migrant Studies, and Gender Studies. The results of this research are designed to increase our understanding of the acculturation processes involved in the relocation and settlement of immigrants, specifically from more traditional cultures, into relatively more Western-oriented cultures.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Iranian women, migrants, acculturation, Sociolinguistics, migrant studies, language</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184600</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of SerpinB2 in tumour cells</field><field name="creator">Lee Major</field><field name="description">SerpinB2 (aka plasminogen activator type 2) is well described as an extracellular inhibitor of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). However, the majority of SerpinB2 is retained intracellularly, and many uPA-independent activities have been reported for SerpinB2 suggesting an alternate function. This thesis explores the role of SerpinB2 in epithelial tumour cell lines, highlights the problems associated with various expression systems and argues that SerpinB2 has no role in growth or apoptosis of tumour cells. A potential role for immune modulation and angiogenesis is suggested in in vivo models. Previous research using SerpinB2 transfected, clonally selected tumour cell lines suggested that SerpinB2 regulates the retinoblastoma tumour suppressor protein (Rb) by binding and protecting Rb from degradation. Despite the use of two techniques under numerous conditions and positive controls, no significant interaction between SerpinB2 and Rb was found. SerpinB2 was reported to bind Rb through a PENF homology motif located within the SerpinB2 C-D interhelical loop region. The PENF homology motif was postulated to represent the motif responsible for binding to the C-pocket of Rb. Epstein Barr Virus nuclear antigen 6 (EBNA6) is a known Rb binding protein, which contains two predicted PENF homology motifs. However, mutation of the two PENF homology motifs within EBNA6 did not reduce Rb binding. Furthermore, the SerpinB2 PENF homology motif is actually not well conserved between SerpinB2 proteins from multiple species, whereas other regions of the SerpinB2 C-D loop show a high level of conservation. These data do not support a role for SerpinB2 and the PENF homology motif in Rb binding. SerpinB2 has been proposed to have a role in regulating growth and apoptosis. To further investigate this proposed phenotype of SerpinB2, SerpinB2 was expressed in a range of epithelial tumour lines using transient transfection. No change in growth, apoptosis or Rb levels were found. After &#8776;2-3 month antibiotic selection for the SerpinB2-expressing plasmid, SerpinB2 protein was lost without the loss of the transgene, indicating selective pressure against long-term SerpinB2 protein expression. To further investigate long-term SerpinB2 expression adenovirus and lentivirus vectors were used. Infection of tumour cell lines with adenovirus vectors expressing SerpinB2 resulted in reduced cell growth, characterised by increased p53 (but not Rb) levels and G2 arrest or apoptosis. When SerpinB2 expressing lentivirus vectors were used to transduce the same tumour cell lines, high levels of long-term expression of functional SerpinB2 was achieved. However, SerpinB2-expressing cell lines showed no differences in growth, proliferation, Rb levels, or apoptosis induced by a range of agents. Growth and apoptosis observed with adenovirus SerpinB2 had all the characteristics of adenovirus-associated toxicity, which has been reported previously for specific proteins. These experiments highlighted the problems associated with SerpinB2 expression systems and suggest that SerpinB2 expression per se is not toxic nor has a role in regulating Rb, growth and apoptosis. Screening of a number of tumour cell lines identified the HPV16 transformed cervical cancer line as expressing high levels of SerpinB2. SerpinB2 was located both extracellularly and intracellularly with a cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution. A high molecular weight SerpinB2 species was identified in CaSki cells and was shown to be the N-linked glycosylated species. Sequencing showed the protein to be Type A SerpinB2 and the protein was shown to form an inhibitory complex with uPA. An abundant low molecular weight SerpinB2 species was also identified in CaSki cell supernatants and appeared to be a proteolytic fragment of SerpinB2. Treatment of CaSki with PMA, TNF&#945; and IFN&#947; increased SerpinB2 levels. Lentiviral based shRNA failed to significantly down regulate SerpinB2 expression and increasing SerpinB2 levels with lentiviral expression did not change growth, apoptosis, Rb levels or E7 transcription. Lentiviral expression of SerpinB2 in (normally SerpinB2 negative) HPV16 transformed SiHa cells, also failed to show changes in Rb levels or E7 transcription. CaSki thus express wild-type and functional SerpinB2, but no evidence could found that SerpinB2 effects HPV16 E7 transcription or Rb levels. The data presented identifies CaSki as valuable source of biologically functional SerpinB2. SerpinB2 expression in breast cancer cells has been associated with positive prognosis. Tubo, a SerpinB2-negative murine breast carcinoma cell line, was transduced with lentivirus expressing SerpinB2 and grown subcutaneously in BALB/c mice. SerpinB2 expressing tumours appeared red and were larger than control tumours. Furthermore, SerpinB2 expressing tumours had a &#8776;2 fold higher density of blood vessels when compared to Tubo and Tubo expressing EGFP. Mice carrying tumours expressing SerpinB2 also showed reduced anti-tumour IgG2 responses. These data suggest that a role for SerpinB2 in regulating angiogenesis and antitumour immunity. In conclusion, this thesis challenges the notion that SerpinB2 regulates Rb, cell cycle, and apoptosis and suggests a potential role for SerpinB2 in tumour angiogenesis and immunity.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">serpinb2</field><field name="subject">retinoblastoma protein</field><field name="subject">lentivirus</field><field name="subject">adenovirus</field><field name="subject">Human papilloma virus</field><field name="subject">th1</field><field name="subject">angiogenesis</field><field name="subject">caski</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184655</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutrition and neurodevelopment of the preterm and term infant</field><field name="creator">Xanthy Hatzigeorgiou</field><field name="description">Introduction Optimal nutrition is vital in the management of infants born preterm. Dietary fat in infancy is fundamental for the provision of energy for growth and development. Essential fatty acids, specifically Long Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (LC-PUFAs) such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been under investigation by several international research groups in the past decade. Essential fatty acids are critical in neurodevelopment as DHA is found in high proportions in structural lipids of cell membranes, particularly in the central nervous system (CNS). The accumulation of essential fatty acids and particularly DHA in the brain and retina occurs most rapidly during the perinatal period, therefore preterm infants are of particular concern (Singer, 2001). Current scientific consensus is that the optimum growth rate for preterm infants is equal to the in utero growth rate throughout the last trimester, however, failure to achieve the optimum intrauterine growth rate is common in preterm infants (Olhager and Forsum, 2003). Preterm infants require large amounts of energy and nutrients with which many infants are not provided or are not able to absorb, due to immature gastrointestinal and metabolic systems and other medical complications (Olhager and Forsum, 2003). There are a number of unresolved issues regarding optimal growth rate and total energy requirements (ER) for preterm infants. Hypotheses/Objectives This study is a &#8220;side study&#8221; to a double blind randomised controlled trial (RCT) of DHA supplementation in preterm infants. The hypothesis of this &#8220;side study&#8221; is that increased DHA during the neonatal period would increase total energy expenditure (TEE) and improve neurodevelopmental outcome. Specifically, at term postconceptual age (PCA) it was hypothesised that preterm infants receiving higher intake of DHA would have higher TEE&#8217;s due to the acceleration in brain maturation. Also, it was hypothesised that preterm infants receiving high levels of DHA would have TEE&#8217;s equivalent to term born infants due to their same brain maturation status. Other hypothesised effects of DHA supplementation include an accelerated maturation of the visual cortical pathways, and accelerated white matter (WM) tract development aiding in brain maturation. The first objective of this study was to measure TEE and ER in very preterm infants when they reached an age of 31-33 weeks post conceptional age (PCA). The effects of DHA supplementation on TEE, at simulated in utero levels, in very preterm infants (born &lt; 33 weeks PCA), when assessed at term equivalent (40 weeks PCA) were studied. Another objective was to compare WM brain tissue volume at term PCA between two preterm groups and then with the term born infants. Visual latency was also compared between the two preterm infant groups and then with the term born infants. Methods TEE was measured using the doubly labelled water (DLW) method which is based on the differential elimination of 2H (deuterium) and 18O from the body subsequent to a loading dose of these isotopes. TEE was measured at the preterm age between 31-33 weeks PCA and again at term PCA. TEE measurements are made at term PCA in a term born control group. Brain assessment was by Magnetic Resonance Imaging and (MRI) and Visual Evoked Potential (VEP). Magnetic resonance imaging quantitatively measured brain volumes and WM. Visual evoked potential would provide information on visual latency and amplitude. Results The cohort consisted of 38 infants. The TEE of the very preterm infant group was measured at 31-33 weeks PCA. The mean (&#177;standard deviation) (SD) TEE was calculated at 80(&#177;27) kcal/kg/d, and using data in the literature for foetal energy accretion of 28kcal/kg/d, the mean ER was calculated to be 108(&#177;27) kcal/kg/d. At term PCA TEE was calculated for the preterm DHA supplemented group to be 56(&#177;19) kcal/kg/d and for the non-DHA supplemented group 70(&#177;39) kcal/kg/d. These measurements were not statistically different. Flash VEP conducted on preterm given different amounts of DHA tested at term PCA found no statistically different measurements. When combining these results and comparing them to measurements of term born infants at term PCA, the right eye measurements showed that preterm infants had statistically greater latencies than term infants. When combining the left and right eye measurements the latencies no statistical significance was found. Amplitude was also not statistically significant between the groups. MRI measures at term PCA were not statistically different DHA supplemented and the non-DHA supplemented preterm infant group. When the preterm infant cohort was combined and compared to the term born infant group, the results showed that preterm infants imaged at term PCA had reduced WM development in a number of frontal lobe projections, and anterior and posterior commissarial pathways of the corpus callosum and corona radiata. Discussion The TEE and ER measurements in this study represent the largest preterm infant cohort to date. The ER values reported here are of value in allowing the calculation of appropriate feeding and nutritional strategies for preterm infants. Although no differences in TEE between the DHA and non DHA supplemented groups were found this may have been due to the small sample size. With regard to the latency outcomes, it can be speculated that if measurements were conducted at a later PCA the correlations may have been stronger and significant. Several other factors may have also affected the results, including alertness of the infant at the time of testing, thickness of the cranium, and other health factors could not be controlled for. This study contains the youngest cohort to be compared via Flash VEP. The MRI data did not find significant differences in brain volume and WM between the DHA supplemented and the non-DHA supplemented groups. The infant CNS is rapidly developing and there are multiple environmental factors which may have affected outcomes. The data did however find differences in WM development between the preterm and term infants. The reduced WM development found in the preterm infants compared to term born infants may provide some explanation for the correlation between preterm birth and poorer cognitive and functional outcomes. Larger studies which extend beyond the first months of life are recommended in order to investigate the long-term relationships between DHA supplementation, TEE and brain maturation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Docohexaenoic acid (DHA), stable isotopes, Doubly labelled water, 2H, 18O, total energy expenditure, energy requirements, preterm infant, postconceptional age (PCA), MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, volumetric measurements, visual evoked potential, P1 wave,</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184666</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic manipulation of Grain storage protein digestibility in sorghum.</field><field name="creator">Phuong Mai Hoang</field><field name="description">Abstract Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) is the world&#8217;s fifth most common cereal crop and provides an important source of staple food in the semi-arid tropics and feed in many other countries. The plant has the ability to grow and yield in hot and dry climates. However, sorghum grain is less digestible than the other major staple crops such as rice, wheat and maize. Therefore, the aim of this project is to improve the nutritional quality of sorghum grain by applying cutting-edge biotechnologies which involve the use of tissue culture and genetic transformation. Recently, Agrobacterium has been used by many researchers to introduce foreign genes into the sorghum genome. This method has some advantages compared to particle bombardment, however, one limitation is the regeneration of transgenic tissues. In this study successfully transformed sorghum using Agrobacterium and regenerated transgenic plants via an organogenic tissue culture system is reported. The results of transformation efficiency were achieved with co-cultivation after 48 hours. Regeneration of the sorghum transgenic plants was improved by using organogenic tissues. The GUS reporter gene and the Hpt and bar selectable markers were used. Southern blots and PCR were used to confirm transgene presence in the T0 and T1 generations. In this study, stable transgenic sorghum plants have been produced. The factors found to most influence Agrobacterium transformation were the type of organogenic tissue from different genotypes. The genotypes and the period of co-cultivation, as well as the selectable marker gene and selection strategy used. However, the transformation efficiency from this method was low (1.12%) compared with the previous efficiencies published for Agrobacterium-mediated sorghum transformation. Therefore, to improve the transformation efficiency for this method further work may need to be done. Thioredoxin genes were transformed into the sorghum genotype 296B by particle bombardment. In the first experiment no transgenics over-expressing trx and ntr were confirmed by Southern blot. In subsequent experiments, a limited number of transgenics of the T1 generation were confirmed and used for further analysis. A transgenic line with both trx &amp; ntr was created by crossing a trx line and a ntr line. The 2 genes in this line were confirmed and showed different levels of expression by Real Time PCR. Also, the level of expression in the T2 hybrid plants was higher compared to the T1 parents. The grains from the transgenic lines were different in gelatinization, viscosity, pasting properties and in-vitro digestibility. The ntr line was confirmed to be more digestible than the other transgenic lines and a non-transgenic line. There was a significant increase of 11% (P=0.02) in digestibility of the sorghum ntr line over the non-transgenic. However, the transgenic sorghum seeds did not germinate after storage for more than 6 months. Differences in the morphology of the starch granules and protein matrix of the transgenic lines when compared to non-transgenic were observed with Scanning Electron microscopy. The difference was observed from the transition to the central zone. Pores appeared in the starch granules of the sorghum transgenic lines, but not in the non-transgenic. This may be directly related to the changes in gelatinization, viscosity, pasting and digestibility. To find regulatory sequences which can direct expression of transgenes in developing endosperm, the &#946;-kafirin promoter was identified and cloned. Two constructs of varying length were made to test tissue specificity of the promoter, by replacing the Ubi promoter of the pUBIGUS vector. The GUS gene was used as the marker gene under the control of the amplified &#946;-kafirin promoter. The result was determined on different explants of sorghum by transient expression via particle bombardment. The result shows the successful identification of the &#946;-kafirin promoter region and its effect on transient expression levels. Agrobacterium transformation of sorghum organogenic tissue was developed. The digestibility of grain sorghum was improved by over-expressing the thioredoxin genes. In conclusion, the sorghum grain digestibility can be improved by transforming sorghum with thioredoxin genes, via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Further experimentation is required to identify regulatory sequences to optimise transgene expression in sorghum endosperm. In order to determine the reason behind the difficulties of seed germination, larger numbers of independent transgenic lines need to be generated and tested to determine whether over-expression of trx &amp; ntr always has detrimental effects on seed longevity and germination.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sorghum transformation, thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase over-expressed, Agrobacterium-mediated, organogenic tissue, &#946; -kafirin promoter.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184670</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ontology Server for Ontology-based Interoperation of Information Systems</field><field name="creator">Mohammad Ahmad</field><field name="description">In order for information systems supporting two different organizations to interoperate, there must be an agreement as to what the words mean. Such an agreement is often called an ontology, or description of a shared world (a.k.a domain ontology). An ontology in general is an agreed understanding (i.e. semantics) of a certain domain, axiomatized and represented formally as logical theory in a computer resource. It can enable semantic interoperability where autonomous and distributed applications can meaningfully communicate to exchange data and interoperate independently of their internal technologies. The main goal of this thesis is twofold. First (general sense), it presents a specification for ontology engineering to guide ontology designers towards building ontology supporting interoperation of information system using a standard modeling approach. Second (specific sense), it presents a specification for what the ontology server is going to serve at commit-time. At this time, the server is used to assist players to obtain a portion of an ontology relevant to their interoperation requirement. First, we investigate the definition of an ontology as a specification of a conceptualization by showing that an ontology supporting interoperating information systems can be seen as the result of interlocking institutional worlds (IWs). An institutional world is the collection of integrated speech acts and consequent institutional facts made by a particular institution. This institutional world is the conceptualization of which the ontology is the specification. To be more specific, we call this ontology is a domain ontology of IWs. Second, we specify a software system, an ontology server needed to support domain ontology of IWs at commit-time for ontology engineering: 1) Commit-time requirements for an ontology server and 2) Ontology view extraction. The commit-time requirement is a functional requirement of the server to assist a player to obtain a relevant portion of an ontology. The discussion of this requirement has led to research into ontology view extraction. Based on the notion of formal ontology, our approach to ontology view extraction takes into accounts both endurants (entities that exist in time) and perdurants (entities that happen in time). Making a link to the domain ontology of IWs, the speech act is an example of event perdurant, while the institutional fact is an example of endurant. That is, our ontology view extraction involves perdurant ontology (ontology of speech acts) and endurant ontology (ontology of institutional facts). The principal contribution of this work is our technical solution for ontology view extraction. Based on an existing structural metamodel for modeling endurant ontology developed by Guizzardi, we present a technique using existential dependency for endurant extraction starting from a seed provided by the user. Since the user wants to commit to the ontology in order to interoperate with other players, the endurant seed is derived from the actions the user wants to perform, which are described in the perdurant ontology. Our metamodel for perdurant ontology is based on an existing business process metamodel for modeling speech acts, namely, Design and Engineering Methodology for Organizations (DEMO). The seed is the institutional facts involved in the speech acts the user wants to perform. These strategies have been implemented by extending with profiles the Unified Modeling Language (UML). Generally, the perdurant ontology is represented by the UML activity diagram, while the endurant ontology is represented by the UML class diagram. To demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach, we develop several collections of running examples based on an extended hypothetical ontology for the Olympic Games. This research is a contribution to the theory of conceptual modeling by proposing a set of specifications that can be used to model domain ontology of IWs. The specification here can be understood from two perspectives: 1) Metamodel and 2) Model. The former is addressed at meta-level which consists of metaconcepts for the languages in which the ontologies are represented. The latter is the resulting specification when these metaconcepts are used to represent some aspect of the reality or world in the domain of IWs. Most importantly, the work here contributes to the ontology server research since the view extraction based on the metamodel is what the server is going to serve.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184677</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural and functional characterization of yellow head virus proteins</field><field name="creator">Chumporn Soowannayan</field><field name="description">Abstract Yellow head virus (YHV) has caused mass mortalities in Penaeus monodon shrimp farmed throughout Southeast Asia since it was first discovered in the early 1990&#8217;s. YHV possesses a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome and a rod-shaped enveloped virion. Together with the closely related gill-associated virus (GAV) identified in P. monodon shrimp in Australia, it is classified in the genus Okavirus, family Roniviridae within the order Nidovirales. YHV particles contain only three structural proteins, a nucleocapsid (N) protein (p20) protein and two envelope glycoproteins gp116 and gp64. In this study, the glycosylation status of gp116 and gp64 extracted from YHV virions was characterized in detail, including the identification of active N-linked glycosylation sites and the nature of the attached carbohydrates. This was achieved by optimizing and applying a combination of methods that included SDS-PAGE followed by carbohydrate-specific staining of gels or probing of membrane-bound proteins using lectins with different carbohydrate specificities, enzymatic removal of N-linked carbohydrates and a variety of mass spectrometry techniques. In these analyses, it was found that N-linked glycans are the major contributor to the higher estimated mass of gp116 and gp64 by SDS-PAGE compared to those estimated from their deduced amino acid sequences. Neither gp116 nor gp64 were found to posses O-linked glycans. Mannose residues were identified to be the major glycan component of carbohydrates linked to gp116 and gp64 and are possibly the sole component of carbohydrate linked to gp64. Unlike gp64, other glycans such as terminal N-acetyl-&#61537;-D-galactosamine and N-acetyl-&#61537;-D-glucosamine were identified to be attached to gp116. Assuming that glycosylation processes in shrimp mimic those of vertebrates that are known in more detail, the nature of the glycans attached to gp116 suggests that they might be added and modified during the transportation of the protein from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Mass spectrometry analyses of tryptic peptides derived from the native glycoproteins and following their enzymatic deglycosylation, generated approximately 81% (gp116) and 66% (gp64) coverage of their predicted amino acid sequences. Detailed mass spectrometry analyses of peptides derived from the deglycosylated proteins identified that most of the potential N-linked glycosylated site in the virion envelope glycoproteins, 6 of 7 present in gp116 and 3 of 4 present in gp64 were identified to be modified by glycans. In gp116, one site was not identified and in gp64 one site was not utilized. As phosphorylation has been shown to affect nucleocapsid protein (N) functioning in vertebrate nidoviruses, SDS-PAGE using two phosphoprotein-specific staining methods, as well as mass spectrometry methods, were employed to examine whether the YHV N protein present in virions is phosphorylated. The protein staining methods provided contradicting results and no phosphate-containing peptides were identified by mass spectrometry. The apparent absence of phosphate in the N protein was also supported by its isoelectric point (pI ~10) determined by isoelectric focusing and two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) analysis, which was very similar to that predicted (pI = 9.98) from its deduced amino acid sequence. Taken together, the data suggest that the YHV N protein encapsulated within virions is not phosphorylated. The RNA-binding capability of the GAV N protein was assessed using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) technique. Full-length and variously truncated forms of the GAV N protein expressed in bacteria were assessed in the assays. It was found that the full-length recombinant N protein bound to RNA in a sequence non-specific manner. Analysis of the five truncated N protein constructs localized the RNA-binding domain to a 50 amino acid sequence in the N-terminal region residing between Met11 and Arg60. A motif rich in proline and arginine residues, which are commonly found in other RNA-binding proteins, occurred in first 18 amino acids of this region. Although RNA-binding was not sequence-specific, the data suggest that this region of the GAV N protein is the most likely site at which it interacts with and nucleates viral genomic RNA during nucleocapsid formation. A synthetic peptide spanning the 18 amino acid of the putative RNA-binding domain was shown to possess RNA-binding properties similar to the recombinant protein fragment. These results indicated that the 18 amino acid, proline and arginine rich motif (MPVRRPLPPQPPRNARLI) in the N-terminal region of the GAV N protein confers its RNA-binding function. Using an immuno-co-precipitation assay, a host protein was found to interact abundantly with the GAV N protein in infected lymphoid organ cells. Mass spectrometry analysis identified the protein as &#61538;-actin. Immuno-histochemistical double-labeling methods in conjunction with observations made using confocal and electron microscopy revealed that actin and the N protein were co-located in cytoplasm of infected cells. Electron microscopy suggested that interaction of the two proteins occurs before nucleocapsid envelopment within virions, suggesting that &#61538;-actin might be involved in transporting the N protein or the nucleocapsid from their sites of synthesis to the rough endoplasmic reticulum where the virion acquires its envelopes. In summary, the research described in this thesis has advanced understanding of the YHV/GAV proteome through the identification of the glycosylation sites in the envelope glycoproteins gp116 and gp64, and demonstrating that nucleocapsid protein encapsulated within virion is unlikely to be phosphorylated. Functional studies have also shown that the nucleocapsid protein binds RNA non-specifically through an 18 amino acid domain near its N-terminus and that it binds and co-localizes with &#61538;-actin in infected cells, suggesting that &#61538;-actin may play role in trafficking N protein in infected cells.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">yellow head virus (YHV)</field><field name="subject">gill-associated virus (GAV)</field><field name="subject">glycosylation</field><field name="subject">phosphorylation</field><field name="subject">immuno-co-precipitation</field><field name="subject">immunohistochemistry</field><field name="subject">nucleocapsid protein</field><field name="subject">envelope glycoproteins</field><field name="subject">actin</field><field name="subject">protein-protein interaction</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184684</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Probabilistic Transmission Expansion Planning in a Competitive Electricity Market</field><field name="creator">Miao Lu</field><field name="description">Changes in the electric power industry have brought great challenges and uncertainties in transmission planning area. More effective planning of transmission grids with the appropriate development of advanced planning technologies is badly-needed. The aim of this research is to develop an advanced probabilistic transmission expansion planning (TEP) methodology in a continually changing market environment. The methodology should be able to strengthen and increase the robustness of existing transmission network. By using the proposed probabilistic TEP methodology, it can reduce the risks of major outages and identify weak buses in the system. The significance of this research is shown by its comprehensiveness and powerful practicability. Results from this research are able to improve the planning efficiency and reliability with consideration of financial risks in an electricity market. In order to achieve the target, this research methodologies focused on two main important issues, (1) probability based technical assessment and (2) financial investment evaluation. During the first stage study, probabilistic congestion management, probabilistic reliability evaluation and probabilistic load flow for TEP under uncertainties have been investigated and improved. The developed methodologies and indices, which truly represent the composite impact from both critical state and probability, have linked with financial terms. At financial investment evaluation part, Monte Carlo market simulation is performed to assist economic analysis. The overall planning process has been treated as a constrained multi-objective optimisation task. Comprehensive investigations are conducted on several test systems and testified by real power systems using the available reliability data and economic information from the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). Overall, this research developed probabilistic transmission planning methodologies that can reflect modern market structures more accurately and it enable a greater utilization of current generation and transmission resources to increase potential operation efficiencies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">transmission expansion planning, probabilistic planning, deterministic planning, probabilistic load flow, real option approach, congestion management, multi-objective optimisation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184687</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Natural History and Determinants of Changes in Physiological Variables after Ischaemic Stroke.</field><field name="creator">Andrew Wong</field><field name="description">Abstract Background The prognosis after an ischaemic stroke is determined largely by how much damage is done to the brain. Currently physicians possess only a few therapies that can improve outcome. Early changes in common physiological variables, such as blood pressure, temperature and blood glucose levels, represent a potential therapeutic target, and manipulation of these variables may eventually yield an effective and potentially widely applicable range of therapies for optimising stroke recovery. However, the natural history and determinants of physiological change require clarification before the effects of manipulating physiology can be assessed. Previous research suggests that blood pressure and glucose falls over the first few days and temperature rises over this time. Some of the determinants of this change have been identified, for example stroke severity, but their influence has not been accurately quantified. The lack of detail in previous attempts to characterise these relationships is partly due to a reliance on traditional cross-sectional statistical techniques. My aims were to use the most apposite statistical technique, namely mixed-effects modelling, to accurately characterise the temporal patterns of post-stroke blood pressure, temperature and glucose, and to identify baseline factors that represent determinants of change in these three physiological variables. Methods A cohort of ischaemic stroke patients was recruited within 48 hours of stroke onset, and their blood pressure, temperature and glucose was recorded at least every 4 hours until 48 hours post-stroke. Factors representing potential determinants of change in these physiological variables were also recorded, including stroke severity and the presence of infection. There were no protocols dictating the treatment of these physiological variables, but if this occurred, those treatments were also recorded. In each analysis, mixed-effects models were generated with serial measures of physiology as the outcome factors and the potential determinants of physiological change as the explanatory factors. These determinants included time, representing the temporal patterns of change. Patients with diabetes were excluded from the analysis of glucose, for several reasons including the excessive impact on glycaemia made by dietary intake in patients with diabetes. Results There were 157 eligible patients overall. The analysis of blood pressure (n=157) revealed a linear systolic blood pressure fall of 14.9 mmHg (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 6.2, 22.6 mmHg) and a diastolic blood pressure fall of 6.1 mmHg (95%CI 1.6, 10.5 mmHg) over the first 48 hours after stroke. Patients with post-stroke infection exhibited a slight rise in systolic blood pressure of about 4 mmHg. Higher systolic blood pressures were seen in older patients and in those with pre-existing or previously treated hypertension, previous strokes or transient ischaemic attacks, in regular alcohol users and in those with mild to moderately severe stroke. Systolic blood pressures were 4.6 mmHg (95%CI 2.35,6.85 mmHg) lower in current smokers than in non-smokers. Of the 156 patients eligible for the temperature analysis, temperature rose by 0.17 deg C in patients with mild stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Score (NIHSS)&#8804;6) and 0.35 deg C in patients with moderate to severe stroke (NIHSS&#8805;6) over the first 48 hours after stroke. Temperatures were higher in those who required paracetamol. Temperatures were 0.33 deg C (95%CI 0.07, 0.58) higher in patients with infection and the effect was fixed during the 48 hour observation period. Blood glucose remained static in the 124 patients without diabetes during the first 48 hours after stroke. Glucose levels where higher in those requiring glucose lowering therapy, and in those with more severe stroke. Conclusions I have quantified the amount by which blood pressure falls and temperature rises over the first 48 hours after stroke. In addition, I have shown that mean glucose levels remain static during this time, suggesting that previous reports of acutely resolving post-stroke hyperglycaemia may have represented misinterpretation of regression to the mean. Several determinants of change in post-stroke physiological variables were identified, with unexpected findings in several cases. Higher systolic blood pressures were seen with stroke of moderate severity but not mild or severe stroke. This relationship was fixed during the first 48 hours after stroke, but while more severe stroke was also associated with higher temperatures, the latter effect became more marked as time passed. Conversely, infection was associated with a fixed elevation in temperature, but was associated with systolic blood pressures that rose slightly during the observation period. These apparent inconsistencies require clarification in future work, for example studies of whether markers of the inflammatory or neuroendocrine stress responses evolve in parallel with the changes in physiological variables. This work provides fundamental information regarding the natural history and determinants of changes in physiological variables post-stroke, and will improve the design of future studies investigating the prognostic significance of untreated and treated physiological variables after stroke. This will ultimately lead to the refinement of clinical guidelines for the management of physiological variables post-stroke and to better outcomes for stroke patients.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cerebrovascular disease</field><field name="subject">Cerebral Ischemia</field><field name="subject">blood pressure</field><field name="subject">body temperature</field><field name="subject">blood sugar</field><field name="subject">medical statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184715</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parent Training Programs for Parents of Teenagers</field><field name="creator">Raziye Salari</field><field name="description">Adolescence is a period of enormous adjustment for both teenagers and families. As children transition from childhood to adulthood, they go through many physical, emotional and behavioural changes. Not surprisingly, many parents describe adolescence as the most difficult and anxiety-provoking period of their children&#8217;s life. Parents&#8217; concerns are well justified, considering the high prevalence of emotional and behavioural problems during adolescence. Although health professionals and researchers share parents&#8217; view of adolescence as a challenging period of life, the scope of research on adolescents is scarce compared to research on children and adults. However, this is now changing. Research on adolescent development and adolescent psychopathology has increased dramatically during the last two decades. Reducing risk factors in adolescents&#8217; development has been receiving more and more attention both from researchers and policy makers. Family risk factors such as inadequate parental monitoring and family conflict are among potentially modifiable risk factors that can be targeted in order to reduce the rate of emotional and behavioural problems in adolescents. Behavioural family intervention is considered to be one of the promising intervention systems in this area because of the extensive empirical support it has received in research with families of preadolescence children. The research presented in this thesis focuses on parenting programs for parents of teenagers. The first study evaluates the efficacy of a behavioural family intervention (Triple P &#8211; Positive Parenting Program) targeting parents of teenagers. The second study explores factors which affect parents&#8217; decisions to participate in parenting programs. The first study outlines a randomised control trial (RCT), assessing the efficacy of a parenting intervention in reducing behavioural problems in adolescents. The study provides support for an intensive individual version of Teen Triple P &#8211; a behavioural family intervention designed specifically for parents of high risk adolescents. The intervention aims to improve adolescent behaviour by reducing parents&#8217; use of ineffective parenting. Participants were 46 families with a teenager aged 11 to 16. The outcomes of the intervention included a reduction in teen disruptive behaviours (d &gt; .85) and parent-adolescent conflict (d = .1.21), as well as decreased parental use of harsh and coercive parenting strategies (d = 1.15) and a decrease in parents&#8217; conflict over child rearing issues (d = .64). These positive changes were maintained at the three-month follow up. In spite of the growing recognition of parents&#8217; need for information, guidance and support during the crucial and challenging years of adolescence, little is known about the factors which affect parents&#8217; engagement in programs designed to help them in their parenting roles. The second study aimed to provide a conceptual framework for understanding parents&#8217; decisions to accept or decline participation in a parenting program by employing the Health Belief Model (HBM). The model suggested that parents are more likely to participate in a program when they (a) perceive their adolescents to be susceptible to development of problem behaviours, (b) perceive the problem behaviours to have serious consequences, (c) believe the parenting program to be beneficial in reducing the risk of development of problem behaviours in their adolescent, (d) perceive the personal, social and financial cost of attending the program to be low, and (e) are confident in their ability to successfully learn and apply what they learn in these programs. The model explained 31% of the variance in parents&#8217; inclination to participate in parenting programs. The study also showed that parents differ in their preferences of delivery format for parenting programs. These two studies contribute to the literature in a number of ways. Firstly, they demonstrate that parent training is an effective intervention in the treatment of adolescent problem behaviours. Secondly, they highlight the importance of addressing parents&#8217; beliefs and attitudes about the benefits of parenting programs as well as reducing participation barriers to encourage greater parental engagement in prevention and intervention programs. Finally, the research emphasises that in order to increase participation rate, parenting programs should be made available in a range of delivery formats. The implications of the current research and future directions are presented and discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">adolescent behavioural problems</field><field name="subject">parenting</field><field name="subject">parent training programs</field><field name="subject">program engagement</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184753</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of Treadmill Walking at High Intensity During Rehabilitation Following Stroke</field><field name="creator">Suzanne Kuys</field><field name="description">The majority of people with stroke regard walking in their community as very important (Lord et al 2004). Walking in the community is limited by slow walking speeds and poor walking capacity (Lord et al 2004; Patterson et al 2007). Slow walking speeds and poor walking capacity are identified sequela in people with stroke (Hill et al 1997). By the end of rehabilitation approximately 80% of people with stroke achieve independent walking (Dean &amp; Mackay 1992; Hill et al 1997). However, less than 10 percent are able to easily walk in their community (Hill et al 1997). Optimal motor learning requires task-specific practice (Carr &amp; Shepherd 2003). Treadmills offer the opportunity for repetitive practice of complete gait cycles (Shepherd &amp; Carr 1999), potentially providing greater intensity and longer duration walking practice than usual physiotherapy rehabilitation. Recently there has been some suggestion that high-intensity interventions may improve walking in people with stroke (Moseley et al 2005). Low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness in people with stroke have been shown to impact on walking, in particular walking capacity (Kelly et al 2003). Treadmills, commonly used to retrain cardiorespiratory fitness in the healthy population, have been used to implement high-intensity interventions, improving cardiorespiratory fitness in people with chronic stroke (Macko et al 2005). Therefore it is possible that exercise aimed at improving cardiorespiratory fitness may improve walking in people with stroke. The aim of these four studies was to investigate in those following stroke if walking on a treadmill at high-intensity during inpatient rehabilitation could improve walking capacity without compromising pattern and quality. The first study determined, in an Australian setting, the duration and intensity of usual physiotherapy rehabilitation. Study 2 compared walking pattern immediately following overground and treadmill walking practice at the same intensity. Study 3 examined the effect of treadmill walking at intensities high enough to influence cardiorespiratory fitness on walking pattern and quality. The final study, investigated the feasibility of implementing a high-intensity treadmill intervention in addition to usual physiotherapy rehabilitation in people following stroke able to walk undergoing inpatient rehabilitation. Intensity in all studies was calculated using heart rate reserve or the Karvonen method. Heart rate is a valid, accurate and stable indicator of exercise intensity due to its relatively linear relationship with oxygen consumption (ACSM 2006). For those people taking beta-blocker medication, the heart rate-lowering effect of this type of medication was accommodated. A target intensity of 40% heart rate reserve was used; as this is the minimum required improve cardiorespiratory fitness (ACSM 2006). Walking pattern and quality were measured in Studies 2-4. Walking pattern was measured by linear kinematics using GAITRite (CIR Systems, Clifton, NJ, USA) and angular kinematics using a 2-dimensional webcam application. Walking quality was determined by observation of the webcam footage and scored using the Rivermead Visual Gait Assessment, Wisconsin Gait Scale and a vertical visual analogue scale by blinded assessor. The first study found that people with stroke spent an average of 21 (SD 11) minutes participating in standing and walking activities that are associated with reaching the target intensity during physiotherapy rehabilitation. Those who could walk spent longer in these activities (25 minutes, SD 12) compared to those would couldn&#8217;t walk (17 minutes, SD 9). However, the intensity of these activities was low; walkers reached a maximum of 30% heart rate reserve and non-walkers reached 35% heart rate reserve. Using the treadmill as a mode of task-specific physiotherapy rehabilitation, the second study in this thesis found that walking pattern was similar following 10 minutes of treadmill and overground walking practice at the same intensity. The third study found that during walking on the treadmill at intensities high enough to influence cardiorespiratory fitness (up to 60% heart rate reserve), many of the linear and angular kinematic parameters moved closer to a more normal pattern and walking quality was not compromised. The final study in this thesis, a randomised controlled trial, found that a 6-week high-intensity treadmill walking intervention was feasible in people with stroke able to walk who were undergoing rehabilitation. Participants attended 89% of the treadmill sessions, reaching an average duration of more than 20 minutes and an intensity of 40% heart rate reserve after two weeks. The intervention also appeared effective with significant improvements in walking speed and capacity following the treadmill walking intervention. Improvements in walking speed were maintained at 3 months. In summary, these studies found that usual physiotherapy in people with stroke was of low intensity. In addition, it was found that treadmill walking was safe and feasible as a means of increasing the intensity of physiotherapy rehabilitation, without compromising walking quality and pattern. Therefore, it may be possible to improve walking in people with stroke using high-intensity treadmill walking.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stroke Rehabilitation,</field><field name="subject">Physiotherapy,</field><field name="subject">Gait,</field><field name="subject">Treadmill</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184759</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Draw Control in Block Caving Using Mixed Integer Linear Programming</field><field name="creator">David Rahal</field><field name="description">Draw management is a critical part of the successful recovery of mineral reserves by cave mining. This thesis presents a draw control model that indirectly increases resource value by controlling production based on geotechnical constraints. The mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is formulated as a goal programming model that includes seven general constraint types. These constraints model the mining system and drive the operation towards the dual strategic targets of total monthly production tonnage and cave shape. This approach increases value by ensuring that reserves are not lost due to poor draw practice. The model also allows any number of processing plants to feed from multiple sources (caves, stockpiles, and dumps). The ability to blend material allows the model to be included in strategic level studies that target corporate objectives while emphasising production control within each cave. There are three main production control constraints in the MILP. The first of these, the draw maturity rules, is designed to balance drawpoint production with cave propagation rates. The maturity rules are modelled using disjunctive constraints. The constraint regulates production based on drawpoint depletion. Drawpoint production increases from 100 mm/d to 404 mm/d once the drawpoint reaches 6.5% depletion. Draw can continue at this maximum rate until drawpoint ramp-down begins as 93.5% depletion. The maximum draw rate decreases to 100 mm/d at drawpoint closure in the three maturity rule systems included in the thesis. The maturity rule constraints combine with the minimum draw rate constraint to limit production based on the difference between the actual and ideal drawpoint depletion. Drawpoints which lag behind their ideal depletion are restricted by the maturity rules while those that exceeded the ideal depletion were forced to mine at their minimum rate to ensure that cave porosity was maintained. The third production control constraint, relative draw rate (RDR), prohibits isolated draw by ensuring that extraction is uniform across the cave. It does this by controlling the relative draw difference between adjacent drawpoints. It is apparent in this thesis that production from a drawpoint can have an indirect effect on remote drawpoints because the relative draw rate constraints pass from one neighbour to the next within the cave. Tightening the RDR constraint increases production variation during cave ramp-up. This variation occurs because the maturity rules dictate that new drawpoints must produce at a lower draw rate than mature drawpoints. As a result, newly opened drawpoints limit production from the mature drawpoints within their region of the cave (not just their immediate neighbours). The MILP is also used to quantify production changes caused by varying geotechnical constraints, limiting haulage capacity, and reversing mining direction. It has been shown that tightening the RDR constraint decreases total cave production. The ramp-up duration also increased by eighteen months compared to the control RDR scenario. Tighter relative draw also made it difficult to maintain cave shape during ramp-up. However, once ramp-up was complete, the tighter control produced a better depletion surface. The trial with limited haulage capacity identified bottlenecks in the materials handling system. The main bottlenecks occur in the production drives with the greatest tonnage associated with their drawpoints. There also appears to be an average haulage capacity threshold for the extraction drives of 2000 tonnes per drawpoint. Only one drive with a capacity below this threshold achieves its target production in each period. Reversing the cave advance to initiate in the South-East shows the greatest potential for achieving total production and cave shape targets. The greater number of drawpoints available early in the schedule provides more production capacity. This ability to distribute production over a greater number of drawpoints reduces the total production lag during ramp-up. In addition to its role in feasibility studies, the MILP is well suited for use as a production guidance tool. It has been shown in three case studies that the model can be used to evaluate production performance and to establish long term production targets. The first of the studies shows the analysis of historical production data by comparison to the MILP optimised schedule. The second shows that the model produces an optimised production plan irrespective of the current cave state. The final case study emulates the draw control cycle used by the Premier Diamond Mine. The series of optimised production schedules mirror that of the life-of-mine schedule generated at the start of the iterative process. The results illustrate how the MILP can be used by a draw control engineer to analyse production data and to develop long term production targets both before and after a cave is brought into full production.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">block cave</field><field name="subject">scheduling</field><field name="subject">operations research</field><field name="subject">mixed integer programming</field><field name="subject">integer programming</field><field name="subject">long term</field><field name="subject">mining</field><field name="subject">underground</field><field name="subject">optimisation</field><field name="subject">caving</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184782</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A strategy for fatigue risk management at a mine site</field><field name="creator">Maxwell, Adrian</field><field name="description">Fatigue in the minerals industry of Western Australia is a greatly under-recognised issue that has serious potential consequences for shift workers at work and at home. A review of fatigue literature demonstrates the elusive nature of fatigue. It is something that most people have probably experienced at some time in their lives. It is a diffuse sensation that is accompanied by feelings of lethargy and a lack of interest in any activity. A general sensation of weariness is a major symptom of fatigue. Fatigue cannot be measured directly and subjective estimates have to be relied upon. Potentially life threatening consequences can result when shift workers perform under the influence of fatigue. Fatigue and sleepiness have the power to kill if not treated with the respect they deserve. A cross-sectional survey of five underground mines was conducted to obtain a better understanding of their fatigue risk management strategies and the views of managers and shift workers on their sleep and shift schedules. Four mines provided information on their fatigue risk management procedures. Ten underground mining crews comprising 147 shift workers provided their views by an anonymous survey questionnaire administered at each mine at the start of shift. Shift worker sleep at the five mines compared well with mines in Tasmania, New South Wales and Queensland. However, it was found that frequently waking earlier than intended was the most widely reported sleep concern for shift workers on day shift, night shift and days off. Falling asleep while on day shift and on night shift demonstrates that fatigue is an issue that can occur on day shift as well as night shift. Fatigue is not an issue that is confined to night shift. Mine fitness for work procedures focused primarily on: shift schedules, hours of work and drug and alcohol issues. The level of detail provided on fatigue risk management was considered to be less than adequate when compared with the three previous issues and fatigue risk management documentation sourced from the minerals industry and the transport industry. The survey data and fitness for work procedures provided by four mines suggests that considerably more work needs to be done to recognise and address sleep quantity and quality, as well as sleepiness and fatigue experienced by shift workers while on shift and at home on rest days. There is a serious need for the Western Australian minerals industry to recognise the vital importance of sleep to shift workers during their shift schedule and rest days. There needs to be a concerted and on-going campaign by the industry to raise and maintain the awareness of sleep as a key element in fitness for duty.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fatigue</field><field name="subject">Risk Management</field><field name="subject">Mine</field><field name="subject">Mining</field><field name="subject">Shift Work</field><field name="subject">Occupational Health And Safety</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184921</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adopting the principles of &#8216;Crew Resource Management&#8217; to the offshore drilling industry</field><field name="creator">Ahern, Dan</field><field name="description">This report recommends a strategy for the introduction of aviation style Crew Resource Management (CRM) to the offshore drilling industry.

Its applicability in routine public mental health practice is however unknown, as most published studies excluded participants with suicide risk or if co-morbid with other disorders such as schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder. Clients of public mental health services are characterised by symptom severity, chronic course of illness, treatment resistance and / or co-morbidity. In order to determine whether CBT has utility in routine public mental health practice, it is important to find out whether symptoms of depression (and anxiety) in this client population will respond to a course of CBT provided as part of standard care. Aims and Hypotheses: This effectiveness study aimed to ascertain if CBT is effective in treating depressed and/or anxious symptoms when such symptoms exist within the clinically more complex population found within Community Mental Health Services / Settings, (CMHSs). It was hypothesised that clients receiving CBT would show reliable and clinically significant improvement in symptoms of depression and anxiety but that the amount of improvement would be less than that reported in efficacy studies with less complex client groups. Method: This was a repeated measures, uncontrolled intervention study with results benchmarked against published data. Forty six adult clients of the Inner North Brisbane Mental Health Service (INBMHS) with diagnoses of Depression and / or Anxiety, in isolation or in conjunction with Schizophrenia, Bipolar affective disorder, or a Personality Disorder were treated with an eight (8) session manualised CBT program as part of routine clinical care. Standardised measures of depression, anxiety and stress were taken at time of referral, time of the commencement of treatment, time of treatment completion and at six-month post completion of treatment. Results: Participants showed reliable and statistically significant improvement in self reported symptoms from commencement to completion of treatment. Gains were retained at follow-up. Effect sizes were in the moderate to large range and improvements were clinically significant for approximately one third of the participants. Conclusions: CBT seems to be an effective treatment for depression and anxiety where such symptoms exist within a mental health population. Further research addressing the limitations of this study would add strength to the argument that the mental health population could benefit from the broad availability of such treatment.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cognitive behaviour therapy, CBT, mental health, psychiatry, clinical complexity, depression, anxiety, effectiveness,</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184959</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards fully Synthetic Intranasal Peptide-based Vaccines against Group A Streptococcal infections</field><field name="creator">Abu-Baker Mustafa Abdel-Aal El-Sayed</field><field name="description">Vaccination comes second in importance after introduction of clean water as a public health intervention which has largely contributed in the reduction of deaths from infectious diseases. Success in the development of a group A streptococcal (GAS) vaccine is expected to save 517 000 deaths per annum according to a recent independent review commissioned by the world health organization (WHO) and would offer an ideal means to prevent rheumatic heart disease (responsible for the greatest health burden) and other GAS-associated diseases which affect the health of 600 million. Traditional vaccine approaches (killed or live attenuated) have demonstrated great success against many bacterial and viral infectious diseases, crowned by the global eradication of smallpox announce by the WHO in 1980 and near-to-be announced eradication of polio viral disease. However, application of traditional techniques in many cases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, GAS and Mycobacteria tuberculosis, has not shown the same success. Risk associated with the use of live&#8211;attenuated pathogens, such as recurrence of virulence (e.g. HIV), development of autoimmune diseases (e.g. GAS), and difficulties of manufacture hindered the use of such approaches. Other vaccine approaches such as subunit vaccines (recombinant proteins) and carrier conjugated vaccine are also hindered by the lack of suitable adjuvants, carriers and delivery systems. The current thesis focused on the design, synthesis and evaluation of novel adjuvants and vaccine delivery systems against GAS. The first chapter reviews recent approaches in the field of GAS vaccine design and new findings in immunology which represent the basis of our novel strategies. The second chapter describes the design, synthesis and evaluation of a novel library of lipopeptides as self-adjuvanting GAS vaccine candidates, composed of: (i) a universal helper T-cell epitope (P25), (ii) a target GAS B-cell epitope (J14), and (iii) a lipid moiety. Systemic J14-specific IgG antibodies were detected following subcutaneous immunization of BALB/c (H-2d) mice with each construct without the need for an additional adjuvant. The effect of changing the order of P25, J14, and lipid moiety attachment, or incorporation of P25 and J14 into a lipid-core peptide system (LCP) on antibody titers was assessed. The point of lipid moiety attachment had the greatest influence on systemic J14-specific IgG antibody titers. Overall, the best vaccines featured a C-terminal lipid moiety, conjugated through a lysine residue to P25 at the N-terminus, and J14 on the lysine side-chain. Mucosal surface of the nasal-oral route is a primary site of GAS infections. An ideal GAS vaccine would have to elicit both mucosal as well as systemic immune responses and hence would not only prevent the development of GAS-associated diseases but also would prevent primary GAS infections. Therefore, the nasal route is considered a highly promising route of vaccine administration to provide local as well as systemic immune responses against pathogens that utilize mucosal surface as site of infection. The third chapter includes immunological assessment of the lipopeptide vaccine library described in the second chapter following intranasal immunization of B10BR (H-2k) mice. The whole library was first investigated in a small scale experiment (5 mice per group) to select promising candidates which demonstrate the best local and systemic J14-specific antibodies. Four selected lipopeptides were further investigated in a larger scale experiment (15 mice per group) followed by intranasal challenge of vaccinated mice with a virulent GAS M1 strain. The best local and systemic immune responses were demonstrated by a lipopeptide featuring a lipid moiety consisting of two 16 carbon chains incorporated at the C-terminus of the lipopeptide. However, this candidate did not achieve protection against bacterial challenge. The best protection (100%) was shown by a lipopeptide candidate featuring a C-terminal J14, conjugated through a lysine residue to P25 at the N-terminus, and a lipid moiety on the lysine side-chain. A possible explanation for these results was investigated where antibodies elicited by the former candidate was found to better recognize the minimal B-cell epitope in the native p145 sequence of the M protein. Circular dichroism study of lipopeptides used in the previous experiment demonstrated that the former candidate features &#945;-helical conformation which is required to produce protective J14-specific antibodies. Further studies are needed to explain structural features required to achieve both &#945;-helicity and strong mucosal immune responses shown by the previously mentioned two lipopeptides. Signaling through toll-like receptors expressed by immune cells was recently shown to result in a robust immune response and was investigated as a possible mode of action for our novel lipopeptides. The fourth chapter introduces our lipopeptide vaccine approach as novel synthetic ligands targeting TLR2. A lipid moiety consisting of two alkyl chains of 16 carbons was found to achieve optimal TLR2 signaling regardless of the position of lipid attachment. Carbohydrates as polyhydroxy compounds provide an easily accessible class of compounds to design scaffolds (carriers) to attach lipids and peptide epitopes in different number and stereochemical positions which makes glycolipopeptides an attractive target for adjuvant research and structure-adjuvanticity relationships studies. The Fifth chapter reports immunological assessment of two series of glycolipopeptides as GAS vaccine candidates and novel vaccine delivery systems. The first series: lipid carbohydrate core peptide system (LCCP); represents a modification of the classical LCP system where polylysine dendrimer is replaced by different monosccharides as carriers for peptide antigens. LCCP analogues induced proper humoral immune responses against incorporated epitopes comparable to the LCP delivery system and as strong as the immune response elicited by CFA mixtures. Moreover, LCCP delivery system has been proved to be tolerant to the use of different epitopes as well as changing carbohydrate cores. Design of novel carbohydrate cores with different orthogonal protecting groups is needed to explore the potential advantage of various stereochemical arrangements provided by monosaccharides. The second series of glycolipopeptides incorporates various glycolipid moieties (self-adjuvanting activity) covalently coupled to the N-terminus of J8 (a model epitope). The new glycolipopeptide vaccine candidates (containing only one copy of J8) bear comparison with an LCP analogue (containing four copies of J8) which would improve the ease of synthesis, purification and cost of vaccine production. The slight difference in immunogenicity among these glycolipopeptides was difficult to be explained due to intervening effects of both the number and orientation of lipids on immunological activity. Further investigation is needed to determine the contribution of each factor.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vaccine, immunity, group A streptococcus, lipopeptides, glycolipopeptides, glycolipids, toll-like receptor, peptide, mucosal delivery, adjuvant, lipid core peptide system.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184964</field></doc><doc><field name="title">TRANSNATIONALISM AND CHANGING PERCEPTION OF MIGRANCY: A CASE STUDY OF GREEK AND CYPRIOT IMMIGRANTS IN AUSTRALIA</field><field name="creator">Ferdinand Brockhall</field><field name="description">This study investigates how immigration models of the post Second World War assimilation policy, subsequently replaced by the multiculturalism ideology, have been empirically perceived by Australian immigrants. Questions point to if modern day migrancy and immigration have transformed the ways in which the concepts are currently understood. Of particular interest is: are settlement, citizenship and assimilation an end point, or should migrancy be recast as a fluid phenomenon, privileged by greater freedom of &#8216;belonging&#8217; afforded by transnationalism? Answers to these questions fill gaps in sociological knowledge. The social research project is anchored in a case study of mainly first but not excluding second and a few third generation Greek and Cypriot Australian immigrant respondents. Data gathering employs qualitative inquiry, applying a Mixed Method approach grounded in the Grounded Theory Method. Fieldwork data are generated by in-depth interviewing of respondents, and interpretation of their statements. Their verbal testimonials are analysed using the conceptually clustered matrix. In this approach text is assembled, sub-clustered, and broken into semiotic segments, permitting the researcher to contrast, compare, analyse, and recognise patterns. The strength of employing the Conceptually Clustered Matrix is that it serves the &#8220;conceptual coherence&#8221; of the data in this study&#8217;s single case inquiry. This study reveals how transnationalism has changed presumptions embedded in the policies of assimilation and multiculturalism. In assimilation, supposition of permanent settlement, and the question of &#8216;belonging&#8217; has been resolved by the immigrants succeeding in effectively transplanting the former ethnic &#8220;I&#8221;, into becoming a new Australian &#8220;me&#8221;. Subsequent multiculturalism provides immigrants options in choosing their self-identity within the society at large and accepting that migrant minorities can subsist in discrete ethnic conglomerates clustered within the compass of wider Australian society. The contribution of this thesis to the body of sociological knowledge is that it investigated presently not or under-investigated scholarship how migrants perceive their diaspora existence, redefined by daily practices among migrants. In a transnational context, the research has focused on exploring post-immigration identity and &#8216;belonging&#8217;.

Data was elicited using an email production questionnaire consisting of four email situations, which vary along two social dimensions: relative power, either equal or higher, and size of imposition, either big or small. Four groups of participants, who were all university students, took part in the study. Thirty-seven Chinese native speakers of Mandarin and 35 Australian native speakers of English provided the baseline data. Thirty-five Chinese EFL learners at low proficiency level and 38 Chinese EFL learners at high proficiency level provided the target data. Altogether 580 emails were collected. Data was classified according to an adapted version of the coding scheme developed by Blum-Kulka et al. (1989). Email requests were analyzed at both the utterance and discourse levels. At the utterance level, directness level, strategy types and internal modifiers were examined. At the discourse level, external modifiers, including all the supportive moves in the opening, body, and closing of an email request were analyzed. Following Beebe et al. (1990), data was looked at in terms of the frequency, content and average number of pragmatic features. Both qualitative and quantitative analysis methods were adopted. To determine evidence of pragmatic transfer, first, the Chinese baseline data and the English baseline data were compared. The EFL data was then compared with that of the two baseline groups. Pragmatic transfer was confirmed if the EFL data resembled the Chinese baseline data but differed from the English baseline data. In addition, the instances of pragmatic transfer displayed by the EFL groups at low and high proficiency levels were compared to examine the correlation between pragmatic transfer and language proficiency, that is, whether pragmatic transfer increases or decreases as learners&#8217; language proficiency increases. Pragmatic transfer was investigated on both pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic levels. Findings of the present study show that pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic transfer occurred at the utterance and the discourse levels in all three areas: the frequency, content and average number of pragmatic features, by both the low and high proficiency EFL learners. Moreover, a comparison of the performance of requests by the two learner groups indicates that the high proficiency learners had a greater amount of pragmatic transfer than the low proficiency learners. The findings of this study lend strong support to the positive correlation hypothesis proposed by T. Takahashi and Beebe (1987). The findings of the present study highlight the importance of the inclusion of pragmatic components in foreign language teaching. Pedagogical implications of the findings are discussed. Possible suggestions regarding how to improve the EFL learners&#8217; pragmatic competence are provided.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pragmatic transfer</field><field name="subject">pragmalinguistic transfer</field><field name="subject">sociopragmatic transfer</field><field name="subject">request</field><field name="subject">directness</field><field name="subject">indirectness</field><field name="subject">politeness</field><field name="subject">pragmatic failure</field><field name="subject">pragmatic competence</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From the Liminal to the Visceral: Professional Learning for Acting (PLA) in Australia</field><field name="creator">Ira Seidenstein</field><field name="description">Abstract Ph.D. Thesis School of Education, The University of Queensland Ira Hal Seidenstein What is the nature of embodied practice, creativity and integral learning in Professional Learning for Acting (PLA) in Australia? An overall purpose of the research and thesis is to bring illumination to a lively heterodoxy in PLA. Heterodoxy is Pierre Bourdieu&#8216;s definition of new or alternative influences in a field. The heterodoxy in PLA now has a rich body of techniques, principles, and knowledge to revitalize the field and environment of PLA. The research and thesis encounter the complexity of Professional Learning in Acting to understand the potential of new paradigms. To locate the context of the research, Bourdieu&#8216;s Social Theory of Education related to his definition of culture and fields as dependent on doxa - and legitimacy - have provided the semiotics for the research. The body of the research and data collection was via ethnography and a primary practice of participant-observation. An inter-connected trilogy of topics was selected as priority issues in the field of PLA. The trilogy is: Embodied Practice, Creativity, and Integral Learning. The three areas have been often developed separately, initially stemming from theorist-practitioners Konstantin Stanislavsky and Jacques Copeau in the early twentieth-century. Since that time, biomechanical research and understanding in the scope of creativity to the mind-body continuum has blossomed in other fields. Yet the frameworks for dialogue with issues related to social theory in education are based on utilitarian, industrial, didactic, and Cartesian semiotics, so that little discussion integrates the complexity of, for example, the trilogy focus of the research. Marranca, founder and editor of Performing Arts Journal since 1976, has critiqued performing arts education where PLA is located. A central criticism she offers is this, &#8213;At its core theatre study lacks sustained intellectual rigor and breadth&#8214; (Marranca, 1995, p. 1). This concern for the intellectual encounter may be engaged through Embodied Practices, Creativity, and Integral Learning. Some recent developments into complex encounters includes research into Vygotsky&#8216;s value for adult education and creativity (John-Steiner &amp; Moran, 2002), and research into consciousness paradigms for PLA reveal new potentialities into PLA (Meyer-Dinkgraf&#235;, 2001; Yarrow 2002). Complexity science can be used to iii create such paradigms in PLA or in Education (Davis, 2004; Davis, Sumara, &amp; Luce-Kapler, 2000; Morowitz, 2002; Wolfram, 2002) There is a body of research, techniques and knowledge that brings together East and West theatre and acting practices. This body of information is generally outside the perimeter of curriculum in Professional Learning for Acting. The knowledge has been gathered by the luminaries of acting, yet it is rarely allowed legitimacy in academia, in practice. The East-West practices may allow for greater embodied learning as they make use of integral body-mind practices. The research had quite physical, active levels of participation-observation components in the three Case Studies that dealt with a nationally accredited course in acting, an independent actor/artist in the process of creating a performance, and an established professional acting company. The participant-observation took place within ten theatre productions, extensive physical, and vocal training, performances, and touring.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">Liminal, Visceral, Professional Learning, Acting, Australia</field><field name="subject">acting, theatre, Suzuki, quantum, creativity, performance studies, Quantum Theatre</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185082</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Water Fluoridation in Queensland 1930 to 2008: A Critical Analysis</field><field name="creator">Harry Francis Akers</field><field name="description">Consistent evidence confirms that the addition of fluoride to achieve an optimal concentration in potable water supplies is both safe and effective in reducing community caries experience. While public acceptance and use of water fluoridation in Australia has been high for forty years, its implementation in Queensland remained low until December 2008. Political and social scientists have long recognised that the formation and maintenance of public policy in Australia is a complex interactive process involving inter alia government, bureaucracy, pressure groups and voters. However, explanations of the factors influencing the outcome of a proposal to fluoridate a municipal water supply remain inadequate. The long evolution of adjusted fluoridation has its genesis in pre-1930 North American concerns over the disfigurement associated with endemic dental mottling. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, many perceived this affliction as the visible manifestation of a public health problem: chronic fluoride intoxication. Reports of environmental contamination of the food chain from naturally over-fluoridated water and agrarian and industrial practices only increased community doubts about the accumulative and toxic potential of fluoride. For these and other reasons the public perception of fluoride was poor. Between 1937 and 1945, USPHS dental researcher and later Director of the National Institute of Dental Research HT Dean and co-workers emerged as the few who understood the fine line between fluoride therapy and toxicity. Their investigations involved not only specialised interpretations of human dental epidemiology but also multidisciplinary studies of human and animal fluoride exposure and homeostasis. However, decisions to implement water fluoridation had to come from the relevant government authorities. Here scientific knowledge faced political reality. Apart from perceived safety issues and resistance to the compulsory nature of water fluoridation, many other barriers to water fluoridation emerged: incompletely understood pharmacodynamics of fluoride; confounding issues in the initiation and propagation of caries; community acceptance of this epidemic; and political sensitivities regarding water. This scientific and social background explained why adjusted fluoridation was amenable to both challenge and misrepresentation. In the US, the constitutional, institutional and financial network provided the basis for an enduring culture of dental research that eventually provided the multidisciplinary evidence to endorse the safety and efficacy of water fluoridation. Although Australians did not experience a widespread human mottling problem akin to that in the United States, Australian fluoride advocates faced similar opposition. The Australian constitution, state parochialism and decentralisation compounded by vast distances fragmented the responsibilities for research, health and water treatment. Each state had limited resources and faced these responsibilities in its own way. Although there were several early attempts in some states at regional dental field studies, meaningful national dental epidemiology did not emerge until 1993. Hence, much of the supportive evidence for fluoridation in Australia had to be imported from North America. This background meant that wherever fluoridation was widely implemented in Australia, state authority played a role. In addition to the general social and scientific concerns about fluoride and fluoridation, before 1957 there were a number of unresolved scientific factors relating to naturally over-fluoridated ground water, climate, tea consumption and fluid homeostasis involving canecutters. These made Queensland different in the Australian context. After 1957, as these scientific concerns in Queensland diminished, the political landscape changed and provided new foundations for political hesitance and expedience. The timing and circumstances of the promulgation of the Fluoridation of Public Water Supplies Act (1963) influenced its nature to the extent that until 2008, this legislation with its link to various local government acts was unique within Australia. Although there were notable exceptions such as the decisions to fluoridate water supplies at Townsville and Mareeba, this legislative background established the &#8220;Queensland difference&#8221; as a fixture in fluoride debates across the state. When combined with inadequate state funding and a lack of political resolve from parliamentarians and councillors, prospects for fluoridation in Queensland were virtually paralysed. Nonetheless, while inquiry into the political reasons for the implementing or the failure to implement fluoridation remains thin, developments in Queensland after December 2007 lend significant weight to the finding that a politically resolute centralised authority with the responsibility for both health and water are key components in the outcome.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Centralised authority, fluoride, legislation, political resolve, Queensland, referenda, water fluoridation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185143</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maternal Neglect: Risk factors, consequences and the neurobiology of mother-infant attachment</field><field name="creator">Lane Strathearn</field><field name="description">While studies have examined risk factors and consequences of child maltreatment in general, relatively few have focused specifically on neglect, especially maternally perpetrated child neglect. This is despite evidence that neglect is the most common and most rapidly increasing form of maltreatment, with some of the most serious long-term effects on child development. Maternal neglect constitutes a substantial disturbance in the mother-child relationship. For this reason, after establishing the epidemiology of neglect at a population level, this thesis examines the neurobiology of patterns of mother-infant attachment using functional MRI. Disturbance in mother-infant attachment, in conjunction with family, social and societal risk and protective factors, constitutes the likely pathway to maternal neglect. Specific objectives were: 1) to describe the magnitude of the problem of maternal neglect in Australia, using longitudinal population-based studies; 2) to identify risk and protective factors associated with neglect, both in a high risk population of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants and a representative birth cohort; 3) to specifically explore whether breastfeeding was protective against maternally perpetrated neglect; 4) to examine the consequences of child neglect on infant cognitive development and head growth; and 5) to determine how maternal brain and endocrine responses differ according to patterns of adult attachment security. In Part A, two cohort studies examined the epidemiology of child abuse and neglect among mothers and their infants born at the Mater Mothers&#8217; Hospital in Brisbane, Australia. Cohort databases were confidentially linked with official notifications of child abuse and neglect. The first cohort included 353 ELBW infants who were assessed at birth and at 1, 2 and 4 years of age. The second cohort included 7223 children whose mothers were enrolled prenatally into the Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy (MUSP), where data were collected at birth, 6 months, and 5 and 14 years. The initial ELBW study examined all reported notifications of neglect, while the MUSP study focused particularly on substantiated maternally perpetrated neglect and the protective effect of breastfeeding. These studies examined a broad range of social and biological predictors. Outcome variables for child neglect were examined in the ELBW cohort using cognitive z-scores and growth parameters. Analytic techniques included multivariate modelling. In Part B, the neurobiology of mother-infant attachment was examined by monitoring a cohort of 61 first-time mothers from Houston, Texas, over 4 study visits. The mothers&#8217; attachment classifications were determined during pregnancy using the Adult Attachment Interview. At 6 months, mother-infant pairs were videotaped, and serum oxytocin measures collected before, during and after interaction. At 10 months, the mothers viewed pictures of their own and unknown infants during functional MRI scanning. The first report examined the brain responses of 28 mothers to happy, neutral and sad infant face cues. The next compared brain responses of 15 mothers with &#8220;secure&#8221; attachment patterns to 15 &#8220;insecure/dismissing&#8221; mothers, and also examined differences in peripheral oxytocin response to mother-infant interaction. Data were analysed using a general linear model and repeated measures ANOVA. Overall, more than 1 in 10 children were reported for suspected child maltreatment, 3-5% as a result of substantiated neglect and 3% with maternally perpetrated neglect, with higher rates seen in the ELBW cohort. Duration of breastfeeding was inversely associated with the odds of maternal neglect, with non-breastfeeding mothers almost 4 times more likely to neglect their child compared to mothers who breastfed for 4 or more months, after adjusting for covariates. Other significant risk factors for substantiated maternal neglect included low education, young maternal age, and race, which were also significant univariate predictors in the ELBW population. ELBW children exposed to neglect showed a progressive decline in cognitive functioning over the first 4 years of life, as well as a significantly reduced head circumference at 2 and 4 years. When mothers viewed their own infant&#8217;s faces, compared with an unknown infant, key dopamine-associated reward processing regions of the brain were activated, including the midbrain&#8217;s ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra, striatum and prefrontal cortex. Mothers with an insecure/dismissing type of attachment showed significantly less activation of these reward regions in response to both happy and sad own-infant faces. On viewing their own infant&#8217;s crying faces, these mothers showed activation of the anterior insula, a region involved in feelings of unfairness, pain and disgust. &#8220;Secure&#8221; mothers showed greater peripheral oxytocin responses during mother-infant interaction, which were correlated with activation of the pituitary/hypothalamic region of the brain, where oxytocin is produced and secreted. These findings confirm the magnitude of neglect as a public health concern, with identifiable consequences and specific risk and protective factors. The neurobiological studies identify neuroendocrine systems associated with mother-infant responses and patterns of adult attachment. Together, these studies theoretically link secure mother-infant attachment with brain reward activation and oxytocin response, breastfeeding success, and a reduced risk for maternal neglect. Implications for prevention and intervention, and future research plans, are discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Abuse</field><field name="subject">Neglect</field><field name="subject">maternal</field><field name="subject">breastfeeding</field><field name="subject">Attachment</field><field name="subject">child development</field><field name="subject">Oxytocin</field><field name="subject">Dopamine</field><field name="subject">Neuroimaging</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185144</field></doc><doc><field name="title">WHY ISN&#8217;T THAT CREEK FENCED OFF? A Study of Landcare, Intervention and Change in a Rural Landscape</field><field name="creator">Erlina Compton</field><field name="description">This study represents a quest to find answers to the complex problem of rural land degradation in Australia. Despite significant investment in environmental improvement programs and community based natural resource management interventions, the problem of land and water degradation continues. A key intervention in Australia has been the Landcare program, which has experienced much success in engaging a large sector of the rural population in addressing the problem. Additionally, the Australian Government has and continues to make significant investment in the Landcare program as well as directly to rural land managers through a range of extension and incentive mechanisms and increasingly through market-based instruments. Whilst financial, human and knowledge capital investment in such interventions appear to have an influence on their success, it is the social and cultural factors that seem to be a downfall. This study investigated this problem through a case study conducted in Gippsland, in the state of Victoria. Through a multi-methods approach guided by foundations of critical realism and influenced by grounded theory, this primarily qualitative study yielded rich insights into the inner workings of Landcare and the values, drivers and motivators of rural landholders and the institutional staff who work with them. Through five research cycles the study explored the health and function of 16 Landcare Groups; three examples of community-based projects which sought to improve Landcare group capacity and the views of 46 landholders and 31 institutional staff on values, drivers and intervention design. A sixth research cycle provided a synthesis of the findings of the first five cycles to develop a conceptual model of community intervention and change which was tested with a sample of the study&#8217;s informants. Emerging as key insights was the role that ownership, social capital and empowerment play in the success of group based community projects. On an individual level, values of landholders, including strong land ownership values and motivations are a key to practice change. This is also mediated by an individual&#8217;s access to various forms of capital to undertake farm management activities including altering practices towards environmental sustainability. The outcome of the study, the model of community intervention and change provide a series of critical &#8216;states&#8217;, &#8216;stages&#8217; and &#8216;transitions&#8217; to the process of individual and/or group change and empowerment. The study conclusions point out the complexities of the problem of land degradation when it is realised that the role of people is critical to its solution. The study provides insight into the essential components of interventions which are required to attain success.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intervention</field><field name="subject">change</field><field name="subject">natural resource management</field><field name="subject">psychological ownership</field><field name="subject">social capital</field><field name="subject">empowerment</field><field name="subject">rural community</field><field name="subject">Landcare</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding systems of regional renewal: case studies of Dresden, Freiberg, Adelaide and the Barossa</field><field name="creator">Louise Rawlings</field><field name="description">This project is concerned with developing an understanding of systems of regional renewal (defined as where a restructuring of regional industries or technologies takes place or where new firms or industries emerge). The framework used for the study was an adapted version of the Holmen-McKelvey analytical tool designed for the systematic study of regional renewal. This included analysing social capital, organisations, and path dependency. As the study was concerned with understanding the operation of regions which by nature are complex systems, the study made use of a qualitative case study method. Four case studies were analysed in depth, two each from Germany and Australia: Dresden, Freiberg, Adelaide, and the Barossa. The conclusions from the research are twofold. The thesis argues that the Holmen and McKelvey framework varies across regions and that that the variation can be explained by the &#8216;varieties of capitalism&#8217; literature. That is, regional renewal systems work differently in different regions because regions are part of a national political-institutional context (or variety of capitalism). First, the paths to regional renewal vary across regions. There are many and varied contributing factors to regional renewal and a holistic approach is needed in analysing the sources of regional renewal as well as in formulating regional policy. Social capital and path dependency in particular were important across all four cases, suggesting that social capital can enable the mobilisation of regional attributes and that historical and context specific aspects of a region need to be considered in regional direction setting. While some contribution by these factors was consistent across all four cases, their apparent strength and the nature of their contributions varied. The roles of universities, government bodies, multinational corporations, small-and-medium-sized enterprises, technology parks, non-university research bodies, and industry associations displayed even more variation amongst the cases suggesting that there can be no &#8216;cut and paste&#8217; or one-size-fits-all approach to regional renewal. Before policy is formulated and implemented, there needs to be a systemic analysis of regional assets and deficiencies. Second, the thesis suggests that renewal systems work differently in different regions because regions are part of a national political-institutional context. Different paths to regional renewal can be explained in terms of different institutional capacities for state-led coordination and governance of the regional institutional environment. The thesis puts forward the proposition that we might expect national structures to impact on the functioning of systems of regional renewal. The case analysis suggests that we might expect coordinated attempts at regional renewal involving several actors to be more successful in coordinated market economies than in uncoordinated market economies. The four cases in this research indicate the national business system impacts on the local level. Five key differences between the German and Australian cases were: the approach of the state at a regional level, social capital, the education and training system, policy continuity, and multinational embeddedness. National policies provide a critical role of strategic planning at the local level. How can an uncoordinated market environment at the national level which includes a focus on competition and anti-trust facilitate cooperation between firms and other actors at the local level which is seen as critical for coordinated attempts at regional renewal? Thus a key lesson from this research is that to achieve regional renewal, different regions require locally appropriate policies supported by national directions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Regional innovation, social capital, organisations, industrial policy, technology, economic development.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Carbon sequestration and soil fertility of tropical tree plantations and secondary forests in Vietnam</field><field name="creator">Sang Phan</field><field name="description">Substantial areas of degraded land need to be restored to provide goods such as fuel wood, timber, as well as ecological services including biodiversity, soil protection and hydrological services. The conventional way to rapidly increase forest cover and attain high timber productivity is to use monoculture timber plantations. Many monoculture plantations, including those involving exotic species, have been successfully used for these various purposes. Although monoculture plantations pose some ecological problems they can be productive and sustainable if they are carefully managed. This thesis has two overall objectives 1) to qualify timber yield, biomass growth and carbon sequestration dynamics (including soil C) in different plantations in Vietnam and from these results propose optimal rotations and management systems to provide sustainable productivity and maximise carbon sequestration in plantations; 2) to evaluate the impacts of different land uses and forest covers on soil properties and fertility in Vietnam. Most of the work was done in plantations of Eucalyptus urophylla, Acacia mangium, Pinus merkusii and in secondary forests and pastures. Two approaches were used for modelling plantation growth and soil C dynamics in plantations. One approach used allometric equations combined with a carbon dynamic model (CO2FIX) and the other used the 3-PG process model. Results from both approaches highlighted the unsustainable consequences of short rotation plantations, particularly those using Eucalyptus urophylla which had negative impacts on soil properties and fertility when managed using short rotations. By contrast, Acacia mangium and Pinus merkusii are better than Eucalyptus urophylla in supplying multiple products and improving soil fertility. At the early stages of their development (the first 20 y), secondary forests and A. mangium plantations did not have different effects on soil properties in five soil types at different locations in Vietnam. Individually, the main effect of forest&#8217;s biomass on soil properties was found in both A. mangium plantations and secondary forests, with increasing biomass having a positive impact on key soil properties. Soil types have distinguished characteristics on different soil properties and plantation age and latitude have significant impacts on some soil properties. There is a need for a system of long-term permanent plots established over a wider scale for future studies. Such a system would be preferable to the pair-wise comparisons that had to be used in this work. Future researchers should pay attention to the establishment of these permanent plots as the data collected from such system will be extremely valuable to understand ecological dynamics and interactions between vegetation and soil nutrients.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185250</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Communicating across the urban-rural divide: How identity influences responses to sustainable land use campaigns.</field><field name="creator">Daniel Healy</field><field name="description">In recent years it has become widely accepted that the natural systems on which we depend for survival are being degraded by human activity. It is no longer a question of if we need to reduce our impact upon the planet, but of the extent to which we need to change our behaviour, and how soon we need to act. Such change will depend upon the support of voters, governments, and the international community and will require wide spread changes in attitudes and behaviour. Using the social identity approach as a framework, the current programme of research focuses on rural land users in Australia and the effectiveness of sustainable land use campaigns directed at them from both urban and rural sources. The studies provide a novel contribution to the area by demonstrating the effects of intergroup threat on group-based communication, in particular, the perception of threat to rural identity and the effect on urban and rural messages aimed at changing land use behaviour. Conclusions about broader social influence processes were also made by assessing rural participants&#8217; perceptions of the degree to which others are influenced. Although the studies are based in the context of rural Australian land users, the results and theoretical implications can be applied to any situation wherein one group is attempting to change the attitudes and behaviours of another group. This could range from local interest groups trying to convince each other of the merits of their ideas through to political parties and nations calling for united and decisive action on global issues. Such groups ignore issues of power and status at the risk of ineffective communications or even a backlash in opinion and behaviour. Six studies were conducted, including five survey studies with rural landholders and one experiment with students at a rural campus. Study 1 (N = 251) was an evaluation of sustainable land use campaigns in general, comparing those from urban sources to those from rural sources. Study 2 (N = 585) extended this by assessing the moderating role of intergroup threat perceptions. This study also measured the perceptions of influence of urban and rural messages on urban people and other rural people. Study 3 (N = 98) assessed the influence of an actual land use campaign delivered by an ingroup source on individuals&#8217; attitudes and behaviours and the perceived influence on others. Study 4 (N = 249) built upon Study 2 but included additional measures to address some of the inconsistencies between Studies 1 and 2. To address the psychological underpinnings of group-based influence, Study 5 (N = 124) included measures of trust in urban and rural sources as well as reports of influence, agreement, and past behaviour. To conclude, Study 6 (N = 64) provided an experimental test of persuasion by manipulating the source of the message. Self-reported identification and intergroup threat were examined as moderators of group-based persuasion. Furthermore, attributions of constructiveness were explored as a possible reason for the superior influence of ingroups. Across the six studies it was found that ingroup messages were consistently more influential than outgroup messages. Attributions of trust and constructiveness helped to explain the superior influence of ingroups. In terms of perceptions of influence on others, there was a third-person effect for urban messages but rural people did not differentiate between themselves and other rural people in response to rural messages. Furthermore, rural identification was associated with greater reported influence from the ingroup source and perceived threat was associated with increased influence of rural messages compared to urban messages. These findings have clear implications for attempts at changing attitudes between groups, particularly where there is a salient and competitive intergroup context. Outgroups operate at a distinct disadvantage in delivering persuasive communications, especially if ingroup identification is high or there is a perception of threat stemming from the communicating group. Evidence of the persuasiveness of ingroups compared to outgroups is further strengthened by the perceptions of similarity in influence of rural sources for self and other ingroup members. The findings on trust and constructiveness hint at the possibility of overcoming barriers to outgroup persuasion if positive motives for the messages can be established. Of course, this depends on the severity of the intergroup context and the nature of communication. Recommendations are made for a collaborative approach to achieving change.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">17 Psychology and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="subject">Persuasion</field><field name="subject">Intergroup Relations</field><field name="subject">sustainable land use</field><field name="subject">urban-rural divide</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185257</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Negative outcomes of hospitalisation: predicting risk in older patients</field><field name="creator">Prabha Lakhan</field><field name="description">Abstract Introduction Most countries including Australia are experiencing an ageing of their population, with an increasing proportion of frail older persons requiring hospitalisation from acute illness. The aging process places the older person at risk of geriatric syndromes, such as falling, dependency in performance of Activities of Daily Living and instrumental Activities of Daily Living, confusion, bladder and bowel incontinence. New or deteriorating geriatric syndromes are a frequent occurrence among hospitalized older patients. Hospital associated factors associated with these outcomes include complications of medical therapies; polypharmacy and excessive bed rest. Few studies have been conducted into factors predicting risk of negative outcomes in older patients admitted to medical units of acute care teaching hospitals. If available, a screening tool with few predictive factors, able to be administered close to the time of admission could be used to identify patients at lower and higher risk. It is imperative that such a tool is developed empirically and tested for its accuracy in identifying patients at high risk. Aims of the research The first aim was to identify the proportion of patients aged &#8805; 70 years, admitted to acute care medical units that experienced a negative outcome. These outcomes included falls during hospitalisation, presence of new or a significant decline in existing pressure ulcers, significant decline in independently performing Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), requiring increased care needs at discharge, readmission to hospital with 28 days of the index hospitalisation, bladder and bowel incontinence, and delirium. The second aim was to identify factors predicting the risk of two of these negative outcomes: requiring a higher level of care at discharge, and experiencing a decline in independently performing ADLs. Based on the predictive factors, two screening tools to identify patients at risk were developed and validated. Method A prospective cohort study of 413 acute general medical patients, aged &#8805; 70 years and consecutively admitted to an acute care metropolitan 700-bed teaching hospital was conducted. Consenting patients expected to remain in hospital for more than 48 hours were included. Patients were excluded if they were admitted to intensive or coronary care units, admitted for terminal care only or were transferred from a general medical to another unit within 24 hours of admission to the ward. Trained research nurses assessed patients and used the interRAI Acute Care instrument to collect information on candidate predictive variables and negative outcomes. Patients were assessed within 36 hours of admission and at discharge to obtain information on predictive variables and negative outcomes. Patients were also followed daily to identify any instances of transient negative outcomes during hospitalisation and at 28 days following discharge to identify any instances of readmission to hospital. The 413 cases were randomly split into 309 cases in the development cohort and 104 cases in validation cohort. Logistic regression models were used to identify the predictive factors independently associated with two negative outcomes, requiring a higher level of care at discharge and experiencing a decline in independently performing ADLs. Findings At least one negative outcome was experienced by 53% of the development and 63% of the validation cohort. The most common negative outcomes experienced were: delirium (27%; 23%), a significant decline in ADLs (19%, 22%), requiring a higher level of care at discharge (16%, 16%), and readmission to hospital within 28 days of discharge (17%, 28%) in the development and validation cohorts respectively. The logistic regression analysis identified four independent factors associated with requiring higher levels of care at discharge: &#8216;short term memory problems&#8217; (OR 4.21, 95% CI 1.79, 9.89; p=0.001); &#8216;dependence in toilet use&#8217; (OR 3.51, 95% CI 1.14, 10.84; p=0.029); &#8216;dependence in hygiene&#8217; (OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.16, 6.56; p=0.021), and &#8216;use of community services prior to admission&#8217; (OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.12, 5.16; p= 0.024). A screening tool developed to assess patients at lower and higher risk had a sensitivity, specificity, positive predicted value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of 77.27%, 73.66%, 36.56% and 94.29% respectively. Reasonable accuracy was evident when tested in the validation sample. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were 60%, 76.32%, 33.33% and 90.63% respectively. Predictive factors associated with a significant decline in ADLs were: &#8216;history of falling&#8217;(OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.12, 4.36; p= 0.023), &#8216;no interest in things enjoyed normally&#8217; (OR 4.30, 95% CI 1.92, 9.64; p=0.000), &#8216;dependence in management of finances&#8217; (OR 3.93, 95% CI 1.63, 9.48; p =0.002) and &#8216;hearing problems&#8217; (OR 2.38, 95% CI 1.05, 5.39; p =0.038). The screening tool had sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV in the development cohort of 74.55%, 69.13%, 36.6% and 92% respectively and 45%, 65.79%, 25.7% and 82% respectively in the validation sample. Conclusion The tools require further validation in larger samples in diverse settings. Future research should focus on developing a screening tool that could predict risk of a number of negative outcomes to enhance the provision of quality patient care.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aged, hospitalisation, negative outcomes, predictive factors, risk screening, geriatric syndromes</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185422</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of blood myeloid dendritic cells in mannose binding lectin-sufficient and mannose binding lectin-deficient individuals</field><field name="creator">Melinda Dean</field><field name="description">Mannose binding lectin (MBL) belongs to the collectin family of soluble pattern recognition molecules that elicit diverse biologic activities. Via multiple carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRD), MBL binds to mannose and N-acetyl-glucosamine oligosaccharides present on the surface of bacteria, fungi and yeast. Following pathogen recognition, MBL activates the complement system via MBL associated serine proteases in a manner independent of antibody and C1 complex. Deficiency in function and level of MBL is found in 25% of otherwise apparently healthy individuals, representing the most prevalent innate immune deficiency. MBL deficiency is a risk factor for the development of infections in humans and mice. The role of MBL as a modulator of infection is complex. MBL deficiency may influence proinflammatory cytokine production, expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules, or vascular damage, during the course of infection. Given that dendritic cells (DC) are antigen presenting cells (APC) with potent capacity to respond to microbial stimulation, I hypothesized that MBL deficiency may be reflected in DC functions associated with microbial stimulation. Initially, I investigated the association of MBL with human immune cells and demonstrated that in both MBL-Sufficient (MBL-S) and MBL-Deficient (MBL-D) individuals, MBL was particularly associated with monocytes. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated MBL was not transcribed by monocytes or other immune cells investigated (T, B, and NK cells, CD11c+DC, immature monocyte derived DC [MoDC], LPS matured MoDC, and granulocytes), suggesting MBL association with the cell surface may be via an adapter or co-receptor. Magnetically separated monocytes but not MoDC bound exogenous purified human plasma MBL (hpMBL). Addition of hpMBL (5 -15 &#181;g/mL) did not induce MoDC activation, and MBL added together with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) did not induce MoDC activation above the level induced by LPS only. In the second part of this study, I used the particulate MBL ligand zymosan (Zy) as a pathogenic stimulus in a whole blood model to gain a greater understanding of the consequences of MBL deficiency. I compared surface phenotype, inflammatory cytokine production and antigen presenting capacity of blood myeloid (M)DC of MBL-D and MBL-S individuals following stimulation with Zy and MBL opsonised Zy (MBL-Zy). Blood MDC in MBL-D individuals, unlike their counterpart in MBL-S individuals, displayed unique functional characteristics, including higher production of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-&#61537;, but poor capacity for allo-T cell effector cell induction. It appeared that stimulation with MBL-Zy reduced elevated production of IL-6 but not TNF-&#61537; by blood MDC in MBL-D individuals. In the third part, expression microarray analysis was utilised to provide broad information on the genes and potential signalling pathways involved in the MDC responses in MBL-D and MBL-S individuals following stimulation with Zy and MBL-Zy. MBL-S individuals demonstrated greater capacity to induce T cell and NK cell signalling pathways than MBL-D individuals. Further, MBL acted as a regulator of important inflammatory molecules, namely T-cell receptor zeta (CD247), IFN-&#947; and perforin 1. The data presented in this study provides novel information on blood MDC function in MBL-S and MBL-D individuals in response to pathogen stimulation, and provided insight into mechanisms involved in the increased frequency of infection observed in MBL-D individuals.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mannose Binding Lectin</field><field name="subject">MBL</field><field name="subject">Dendritic Cells</field><field name="subject">Innate Immunity</field><field name="subject">Zymosan</field><field name="subject">IL-6</field><field name="subject">TNF-a</field><field name="subject">Microarray</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185426</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Indigenous Self-Determination in the Torres Strait</field><field name="creator">Groves, Christie</field><field name="description">The thesis examines existing claims for self-determination in Torres Strait, the mechanics of recognition of the claim, and future possibilities for self-governance in the  region.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Torres Strait Islanders</field><field name="subject">Indigenous self-determination</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:10988</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who's Afraid of the Dark?

It is argued and demonstrated that government initiatives have merely undergone technical adjustments designed to retain assimilationist practices, rather than advance the recognition of          Aboriginal people in Australia as Aboriginal people. In terms of agenda and policy, non-Aboriginal values, perspectives and assumptions dominate and control the power of definition. This          domination has characterised Aboriginal relations with the state through the colonial experience, federation and contemporary practices. However, the most significant 'change' in this          relationship is the co-optation of Aboriginal people into non-Aboriginal administrative structures on the assumption that such mechanisms can adequately accommodate Aboriginal rights and          interests.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">370103 Race and Ethnic Relations</field><field name="subject">Australian Aborigines</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal self-government</field><field name="subject">Self-determination</field><field name="subject">Indigenous self-government</field><field name="subject">Social policy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:11013</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transforming Constitutionalism: Indigenous-White Relations in Canada, 1983-1987</field><field name="creator">Kajlich, Helena</field><field name="description">In this dissertation I examine whether the First Ministers' Coferences (FMCs) and political accords negotiated at these meetings from 1983-1987 assisted in transforming Canadian  constitutionalism. During the period 1983-1987, four FMCs were held to consider Aboriginal peoples' place in a new Constitutional order. These meetings renegotiated the relationship between  indigenous and non-indigenous peoples in Canada by reconsidering some of the assumptions permeating Canadian constitutionalism. The FMCs involved direct dialogues betwen heads of federal  government, provincial governments and the four main Aboriginal organisations. Political accords were used in these FMCs to direct the dialogues and to identify when mutually acceptable  constitutional associations had been achieved. Tully's reconceptualisation of constitutionalism will be used to evaluate the extent to which Canadian constitutionalism was transformed. He argues  that constitutionalism is an activity or process of ongoing dialogues between diverse cultures. He further suggests that three conventions operate to enable these intercultural dialogues to  recognise and accommodate cultural diversity. These conventions are mutual recognition, consent and cultural continuity. In order to identify whether constitutionalism was transformed, I consider  whether the relationship between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples was altered to further recognise and accommodate cultural diversity. This will be demonstrated by examining whether Tully's  three conventions were adopted and advanced during the FMCs between 1983-1987. I conclude that the FMCs and the negotiation around political accords adopted and promoted Tully's three conventions,  thereby further recognising and accommodating indigenous Canadians and thus transforming Canadian constitutionalism.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Canada</field><field name="subject">indigenous self-determination</field><field name="subject">constitutionalism</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal peoples</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:10615</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Critical Sets in Latin Squares and Associated Structures</field><field name="creator">Bean, Richard Winston</field><field name="description">A critical set in a Latin square of order n is a set of entries in an n x n array which can be embedded in precisely one Latin square of order n, with the property that if any entry of the critical set is deleted, the remaining set can be embedded in more than one Latin square of order n. The number of critical sets grows super-exponentially as the order of the Latin square increases. It is difficult to find patterns in Latin squares of small order (order 5 or less) which can be generalised in the process of creating new theorems. Thus, I have written many algorithms to find critical sets with various properties in Latin squares of order greater than 5, and to deal with other related structures. Some algorithms used in the body of the thesis are presented in Chapter 3; results which arise from the computational studies and observations of the patterns and subsequent results are presented in Chapters 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. The cardinality of the largest critical set in any Latin square of order n is denoted by lcs(n). In 1978 Curran and van Rees proved that lcs(n)&lt;=n2-n. In Chapter 4, it is shown that lcs(n)&lt;=n2-3n+3. Chapter 5 provides new bounds on the maximum number of intercalates in Latin squares of orders mX2^alpha (m odd, alpha&gt;=2) and mX2^alpha+1 (m odd, alpha&gt;=2 and alpha not equal to 3), and a new lower bound on lcs(4m). It also discusses critical sets in intercalate-rich Latin squares of orders 11 and 14. In Chapter 6 a construction is given which verifies the existence of a critical set of size n2 divided by 4 + 1 when n is even and n&gt;=6. The construction is based on the discovery of a critical set of size 17 for a Latin square of order 8. In Chapter 7 the representation of Steiner trades of volume less than or equal to nine is examined. Computational results are used to identify those trades for which the associated partial Latin square can be decomposed into six disjoint Latin interchanges. Chapter 8 focusses on critical sets in Latin squares of order at most six and extensive computational routines are used to identify all the critical sets of different sizes in these Latin squares.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280401 Analysis of Algorithms and Complexity</field><field name="subject">230101 Mathematical Logic, Set Theory, Lattices And Combinatorics</field><field name="subject">280405 Discrete Mathematics</field><field name="subject">Latin squares</field><field name="subject">algorithms</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:10612</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Playing Second Fiddle: A history of technology and organisation in the Australian music economy (1901-1990)</field><field name="creator">Rooney, David</field><field name="description">This thesis is a socio-economic history of the relationship between music technology and organisational practices in twentieth-century Australia. It argues that the history of technology in the Australian music economy is dependent not only upon the changing technical characteristics of musical instruments and electronic consumer goods but also upon government policy-making, management practices in music technology manufacturing firms and patterns of music technology consumption. The thesis examines economic statistics regarding the import, export and local production of music technology in Australia. The economic statistics have not previously been examined in relation to the history of music technology in Australia. The historical analysis is structured according to a four-part periodisation which includes the Electric Age (1901-1930), the Electronic Age (1930-1950), the Transistor Age (1950-1970) and the Information Age (1970-1990). This periodisation enables the analysis to continually be refocussed as the key technological and socio-economic dynamics change. With this perspective, the history of the relationship between technology and organisation in the Australian music economy has been demonstrated to be dependent on a number of key technological changes. The thesis examines changes including the shift from acoustic to electric recording; the development of transistor-based consumer electronics goods; and the advent of digital information technology. However, a number of key social determinants, particularly organisational modes, are examined including changes from protectionist to more deregulated trade policy; lack of business skills in areas such as marketing, manufacturing technique and industrial research and development; and the development of a sense of popular modernity which is expressed in the consumption of new, technically advanced and glamorous music technology. In addition to the new perspectives on the history of music technology provided by the analysis of empirical economic data, this thesis contributes to the historiography of technology. The analytical framework it proposes locates music technology within what is described as an assemblage of technologies: technologies of production, technologies of sign systems, technologies of power and technologies of the self. This approach makes clear the interdependence of technological and social factors, and the inadequacy of narrow technological determinist and social constructivist accounts. The notion of an assemblage of technologies is further embellished by drawing upon key elements of recent theories of systems analysis: the seamless web, evolution and chaos theory. Through this analytical framework and the socio-economic analysis of the relationship between music technology and organisational practices, the thesis demonstrates that the history of technology cannot be understood unless it is seen as part of a complex and interacting technical, social, economic and institutional system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410199 Performing Arts not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">359999 Other Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="subject">340301 Economic History</field><field name="subject">220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts - General</field><field name="subject">420399 Cultural Studies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">370601 History and Philosophy of Science and Technology</field><field name="subject">370602 Sociology and Social Studies of Science and Technology</field><field name="subject">350299 Business and Management not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Australian history</field><field name="subject">technology</field><field name="subject">music industry</field><field name="subject">history of technology</field><field name="subject">technological change</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:10774</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-Conventional Sintered Aluminium Powder Alloys</field><field name="creator">Sercombe, Timothy Barry</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to improve the properties of pressed and sintered aluminium powder alloys. This improvement was to be achieved using two methods. The first method involved  the selection of an alloy system using binary aluminium phase diagrams and a knowledge of the phase diagram characteristics of ideal sintering systems. The second approach involved the judicious  use of selected trace element additions to modify the sintering characteristics of aluminium and its alloys. A trace amount of magnesium was found to be critical to the sintering of aluminium  powder due to its disrupting effect on the tenacious oxide layer covering the powder particles. The critical amount of Mg required to optimise both density and mechanical properties is dependent on  the specific volume of oxide and the therefore particle size. The optimum concentration is 0.1-1.0wt% Mg. The Al-Sn phase diagram exhibits many of the characteristics of an ideal sintering system.  Unsurprisingly, Sn was found to be an extremely efficient sintering aid, but only in the presence of Mg. Near full density parts were produced using an Al-8Sn-0.15Mg alloy in short sintering times  (30 minutes). Additionally, as-sintered ductilities exceeding 20% were achieved using an Al-2Sn-0.15Mg alloy. Alloys based on the Al-Sn-Mg system lend themselves to sintering without compaction and  therefore freeformed Al-Sn-Mg alloys have been produced and sintered to near full density from a starting density of ~50%. Trace amounts of Sn (Pb, In, Bi, or Sb) enhance the sintering response of  an Al-4Cu-0.15Mg alloy via a vacancy binding mechanism. A similar mechanism suppresses natural ageing and stimulates artificial ageing when trace amounts of Sn are added to this alloy. A  Sn-modified 2XXX series alloy has also been produced with mechanical properties nearly 20% above current commercial alloys. Along with the addition of 0.1wt%Sn, this improvement required an  alteration to the solution treatment cycle which allowed the use of a higher sintering temperature without the formation of large amounts of boundary phase.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">291403 Alloy Materials</field><field name="subject">sintering</field><field name="subject">aluminium</field><field name="subject">aluminum</field><field name="subject">aluminium powder alloys</field><field name="subject">pressing</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:10607</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Measurement of Task Complexity and Cognitive Ability: Relational Complexity in Adult Reasoning</field><field name="creator">Birney, Damian Patrick</field><field name="description">The theory of relational complexity (RC) developed by Halford and his associates (Halford et al., 1998a) proposes that, in addition to the number of unique entities that can be  processed in parallel, it is the structure (complexity) of the relations between these entities that most appropriately captures the essence of processing capacity limitations. Halford et al.  propose that the relational complexity metric forms an ordinal scale along which both task complexity and an individual's processing capacity can be ranked. However, the underlying quantitative  structure of the RC metric is largely unknown. It is argued that an assessment of the measurement properties of the RC metric is necessary to first demonstrate that the scale is able to rank order  task complexity and cognitive capacity in adults. If in addition to ordinal ranking, it can be demonstrated that a continuous monotonic scale underlies the ranking of capacity (the natural  extension of the complexity classification), then the potential to improve our understanding of adult cognition is further realised. Using a combination of cognitive psychology and individual  differences methodologies, this thesis explores the psychometric properties of RC in three high level reasoning tasks. The Knight-Knave Task and the Sentence Comprehension Task come from the  psychological literature. The third task, the Latin Square Task, was developed especially for this project to test the RC theory. An extensive RC analysis of the Knight-Knave Task is conducted  using the Method for Analysis of Relational Complexity (MARC). Processing in the Knight-Knave Task has been previously explored using deduction-rules and mental models. We have taken this work as  the basis for applying MARC and attempted to model the substantial demands these problems make on limited working memory resources in terms of their relational structure. The RC of the Sentence  Comprehension Task has been reported in the literature and we further review and extend the empirically evidence for this task. The primary criterion imposed for developing the Latin Square Task  was to minimize confounds that might weaken the identification and interpretation of a RC effect. Factors such as storage load and prior experience were minimized by specifying that the task should  be novel, have a small number of general rules that could be mastered quickly by people of differing ages and abilities, and have no rules that are complexity level specific. The strength of MARC  lies in using RC to explicitly link the cognitive demand of a task with the capacity of the individual. The cognitive psychology approach predicts performance decrements with increased task  complexity and primarily deals with aggregated data across task condition (comparison of means). It is argued however that to minimise the subtle circularity created by validating a task's  complexity using the same information that is used to validate the individual's processing capacity, an integration of the individual differences approach is necessary. The first major empirical  study of the project evaluates the utility of the traditional dual-task approach to analyse the influence of the RC manipulation on the dual-task deficit. The Easy-to-Hard paradigm, a modification  of the dual-task methodology, is used to explore the influence of individual differences in processing capacity as a function of RC. The second major empirical study explores the psychometric  approach to cognitive complexity. The basic premise is that if RC is a manipulation of cognitive complexity in the traditional psychometric sense, then it should display similar psychometric  properties. That is, increasing RC should result in an increasing monotonic relationship between task performance and Fluid Intelligence (Gf) - the complexity-Gf effect. Results from the comparison  of means approach indicates that as expected, mean accuracy and response times differed reliably as a function of RC. An interaction between RC and Gf on task performance was also observed. The  pattern of correlations was generally not consistent across RC tasks and is qualitatively different in important ways to the complexity-Gf effect. It is concluded that the Latin Square Task has  sufficient measurement properties to allows us to discuss (i) how RC differs from complexity in tasks in which expected patterns of correlations are observed, (ii) what additional information needs  to be considered to assist with the a priori identification of task characteristics that impose high cognitive demand, and (iii) the implications for understanding reasoning in dynamic and  unconstrained environments outside the laboratory. We conclude that relational complexity theory provides a strong foundation from which to explore the influence of individual differences in  performance further.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380199 Psychology not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">380102 Learning, Memory, Cognition and Language</field><field name="subject">relational complexity</field><field name="subject">processing limitations</field><field name="subject">cognitive psychology</field><field name="subject">cognition</field><field name="subject">comprehension</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:10608</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptive Phase Measurements</field><field name="creator">Berry, Dominic William</field><field name="description">In this thesis I consider the general problem of how to make the best possible phase measurements using feedback. Both the optimum input state and optimum feedback are considered for  both single-mode dyne measurements and two-mode interferometric measurements. I derive the optimum input states under general dyne measurements when the mean photon number is fixed, both for  general states and squeezed states. I propose a new feedback scheme that introduces far less phase uncertainty than mark II feedback, and is very close to the theoretical limit. I also derive  results for the phase variance when there is a time delay in the feedback loop, showing that there is a lower limit to the introduced phase variance, and this is approached quite accurately under  some conditions. I derive the optimum input states for interferometry, showing that the phase uncertainty scales as 1/N for all the common measures of uncertainty. This is contrasted with the  |j0&gt; state, which does not scale as 1/N for all measures of phase uncertainty. I introduce an adaptive feedback scheme that is very close to optimum, and can give scaling very close to 1/N for  the uncertainty. Lastly I consider the case of continuous measurements, for both the dyne and interferometric cases.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">240402 Quantum Optics and Lasers</field><field name="subject">240201 Theoretical Physics</field><field name="subject">780102 Physical sciences</field><field name="subject">phase measurement</field><field name="subject">auxiliary phase shift</field><field name="subject">homodyne measurement</field><field name="subject">phase uncertainty</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:10609</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Habermas And Critique: Theoretical Bases Of A Radical Social Democratic Politics</field><field name="creator">Leet, Martin Ronald</field><field name="description">This dissertation aims to evaluate the philosophy of Jurgen Habermas with reference to the arguments it provides for a theory of radical social democratic politics. Habermas is a  German philosopher and social theorist whose broad concern is the defence and elaboration of the 'project of modernity'. This means that he wishes to justify modern, developed societies as viable  and worthwhile forms of civilization. He attempts to specify and redeem the claim that these societies represent, potentially, the most advanced and rational way of organizing human life. Habermas  is committed, among the various political programs which raise this kind of claim and seek to realize it in practice, to a form of radical social democracy. This tradition of theory and practice  pursues the task of human emancipation by means of fundamental reforms to the social, cultural, economic and political institutions of contemporary modern societies. Habermas' work can be  understood as one of the most systematic contributions to this tradition. The central question guiding the dissertation concerns the theoretical and political adequacy of this contribution. The  dissertation establishes two general criteria for evaluating Habermas' work. The first criterion requires identifying the normative foundations of social democratic politics. It is argued that a  'theory of the rational' is needed to satisfy this. Such a theory must demonstrate that the social structures and political institutions of the modern epoch represent an hitherto unprecedented  opportunity for the expression of the human capacity for rationality. The exposition of normative grounds for social democratic politics determines the basis for social criticism and political  struggle. A theory of the rational, in other words, informs us of why we are struggling. Nonetheless, such a theory, on its own, cannot provide guidance about how to struggle. The second criterion  of evaluation relates to this question of 'how', of what theoretical direction can be given to political practice. The dissertation contends, in this regard, that a 'theory of the irrational' is  necessary. It is argued that a theory of the irrational offers a framework for orienting social movements in struggles against those obstacles which stand in the way of a further expansion of  rationality. Such a theory seeks to understand the irrationality of human life in an effort to recommend political strategies that can intervene prudently in the current state of affairs. It is  maintained that a satisfactory construction of both theories is essential for an adequate comprehension of radical social democratic politics. The dissertation pursues this argument by clarifying  the nature of three dimensions of 'critique' within Habermas' oeuvre. Conceptions of critique represent methodological frameworks for formulating theories of the rational and the irrational.  Habermas deploys these methods of critique throughout his work. It is argued, however, that his application of critique focuses primarily on providing a theory of the rational. The central thesis  is that while he offers the rudiments of a theory of the irrational, this theory is underdeveloped. Since this theory addresses the question of how social movements are to struggle, it is argued  that Habermas' approach lacks a practical dimension. The dissertation concludes that his contribution in this regard needs to be elaborated more consistently and in more detail. The dissertation  represents an internal analysis of Habermas' work. It seeks to ascertain whether his theory achieves the philosophical and political goals required by the tradition of thought to which it belongs.  The dissertation contributes to the critical literature on Habermas' writings in three substantial ways. First, it establishes a framework for understanding how the separate elements of his theory  fit together. The identification of general criteria with respect to which a theory of social democracy is to be evaluated means that the political purposes of these various elements can be  understood more clearly. The tensions between them can also be illustrated. Second, with the help of this framework, the dissertation expands upon and sharpens longstanding criticisms of Habermas'  thinking which have pointed to a missing practical dimension. Third, the dissertation identifies theoretical resources, elaborated by Habermas himself, which it is argued can be used to overcome  these problems of impracticality. With this, the dissertation also contributes, in a more indirect way, to the current debate about the meaning of and possibilities for social democratic  politics.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">360104 Political Theory and Political Philosophy</field><field name="subject">social democracy</field><field name="subject">rationality</field><field name="subject">political practice</field><field name="subject">radicalism</field><field name="subject">social change</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:10610</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Generic Proof Checker</field><field name="creator">Watson, Geoffrey Norman</field><field name="description">The use of formal methods in software development seeks to increase our confidence in the resultant system. Their use often requires tool support, so the integrity of a development  using formal methods is dependent on the integrity of the tool-set used. Specifically its integrity depends on the theorem prover, since in a typical formal development system the theorem prover is  used to establish the validity of the proof obligations incurred by all the steps in the design and refinement process. In this thesis we are concerned with tool-based formal development systems  that are used to develop high-integrity software. Since the theorem prover program is a critical part of such a system, it should ideally have been itself formally verified. Unfortunately, most  theorem provers are too complex to be verified formally using currently available techniques. An alternative approach, which has many advantages, is to include a proof checker as an extra component  in the system, and to certify this. A proof checker is a program which reads and checks the proofs produced by a theorem prover. Proof checkers are inherently simpler than theorem provers, since  they only process actual proofs, whereas much of the code of a theorem prover is concerned with searching the space of possible proofs to find the required one. They are also free from all but the  simplest user interface concerns, since their input is a proof produced by another program, and their output may be as simple as a `yes/no' reply to the question: Is this a valid proof? plus a list  of assumptions on which this judgement is based. When included in a formal development system a stand-alone proof checker is, in one sense, superfluous, since it does not produce any proofs -- the  theorem prover does this. Instead its importance is in establishing the integrity of the results of the system -- it provides extra assurance. A proof checker provides extra assurance simply by  checking the proofs, since all proofs have then been validated by two independent programs. However a proof checker can provide an extra, and higher, level of assurance if it has been formally  verified. In order for formal verification to be feasible the proof checker must be as simple as possible. In turn the simplicity of a proof checker is dependent on the complexity of the data which  it processes, that is, the representation of the proofs that it checks. This thesis develops a representation of proofs that is simple and generic. The aim is to produce a generic representation  that is applicable to the proofs produced by a variety of theorem provers. Simplicity facilitates verification, while genericity maximises the return on the effort of verification. Using a generic  representation places obligations on the theorem provers to produce a proof record in this format. A flexible recorder/translator architecture is proposed which allows proofs to be recorded by  existing theorem provers with minimal changes to the original code. The prover is extended with a recorder module whose output is then, if necessary, converted to the generic format by a separate  translator program. A formal specification of a checker for proofs recorded in this representation is given. The specification could be used to formally develop a proof-checker, although this step  is not taken in this thesis. In addition the characteristics of both the specification and possible implementations are investigated. This is done to assess the size and feasibility of the  verification task, and also to confirm that the design is not over-sensitive to the size of proofs. This investigation shows that a checker developed from the specification will be scalable to  handle large proofs. To investigate the feasibility of a system based on this architecture, prototype proof recorders were developed for the Ergo 5 and Isabelle 98 theorem provers. In addition a  prototype checker was written to check proofs in the proposed format. This prototype is compatible with the formal specification. The combined system was tested successfully using existing proofs  for both the Ergo 5 and Isabelle 98 theorem provers.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280499 Computation Theory and Mathematics not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">280403 Logics and Meanings of Programs</field><field name="subject">700102 Application tools and system utilities</field><field name="subject">Software verification</field><field name="subject">theorem proving</field><field name="subject">proof checking</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:10603</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of Hormonal Treatments, Appraisal, and Coping on Cognitive and Psychosocial Functioning of Men With Non-Localised Prostate Cancer</field><field name="creator">Green, Heather Joy</field><field name="description">In chronic illnesses, such as prostate cancer, multiple health outcomes need to be considered. This project focused on two types of health outcomes: health-related quality of life  (HRQoL) and cognitive function. The first aim was to investigate cognitive effects of pharmacological androgen-suppressing treatment. Numerous studies have shown cognitive performance to be  associated with sex hormones. One of the main groups of drugs used for hormonal ablation in men with prostate cancer, the luteinising hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists, has been associated  with adverse cognitive effects in controlled studies in women and in case reports of female and male patients. However, there have been no published studies on the effect of LHRH agonists and other  androgen-suppressing treatments on cognitive functioning in male patients. The second aim was to investigate the effect of treatments on HRQoL in men with prostate cancer. There are few randomised  treatment studies of HRQoL in these patients. The third aim was to study additional predictors of HRQoL, examining stress and coping theory as a theoretical basis for understanding individual  differences in HRQoL. The fourth aim was to examine patients' subjective experiences of prostate cancer. To investigate these questions, 82 men with non-localised prostate cancer were randomly  assigned to receive leuprorelin (LHRH agonist), goserelin (LHRH agonist), cyproterone (steroidal antiandrogen), or close clinical monitoring. These patients and 20 community volunteers matched for  age, marital status, and general health undertook medical, psychosocial, and cognitive assessments before treatment and after 6 and 12 months of treatment. The main question for statistical  analysis was whether dependent variables would show Group x Time interactions in the predicted directions. Compared with baseline assessments, men administered androgen suppression monotherapy  performed worse in 3/12 tests of attention, memory, and executive function. Twenty-six percent of men randomised to active treatment demonstrated clinically significant decline in one or more  cognitive tests at 6 months compared with baseline performance. By contrast, no community volunteers or patients randomised to close monitoring showed decline in test performance. Men on hormonal  treatments reported impaired sexual function on treatment compared with baseline assessments. Men assigned to close monitoring and cyproterone treatment reported increased emotional distress over  time. Groups did not differ in change in existential satisfaction, subjective cognitive function, physical symptoms, or social and role functioning. For individuals, hormonal treatments were more  frequently associated with decreased physical, sexual, social and role functioning, but were also associated with improved HRQoL for some individuals. In hierarchical regression analysis, HRQoL was  lower for men who had more comorbid illnesses, a history of neurological dysfunction, higher threat appraisals, or higher use of emotion-focused coping strategies. Coping strategies also showed  some longitudinal associations with HRQoL, even when earlier levels of HRQoL had been taken into account. Subjective reports demonstrated that many patients viewed prostate cancer as a relatively  manageable problem. Several patients said that other health problems affected them more than prostate cancer, whereas no patient said that prostate cancer was worse than other problems. Comments  about the seriousness of prostate cancer were equally divided between patients who reported it as very serious (14.3% of patients) and those who saw it as a relatively minor problem (14.3%). Other  patient observations were grouped into categories of personal responses to prostate cancer, health, and health research; life circumstances that were not directly associated with health;  attributions about medication; and function prior to the study. The results demonstrated that pharmacological androgen suppression therapy was associated with impaired memory, attention, and  executive function in male patients. Hormonal treatments and close monitoring had differential effects on patients' HRQoL, particularly in terms of sexual function and emotional distress. HRQoL was  also associated with appraisal and coping, to a greater extent than it was associated with medical variables, supporting the applicability of stress and coping theory for these patients.  Observations from participants placed these findings in the context of participants' concerns, demonstrating that issues such as cognitive and sexual function were relevant for these patients.  These findings suggest that cognitive function should be given increased attention as a health outcome, not only in "neurological" disorders but also in other "non-neurological" conditions such as  prostate cancer. They also support continued efforts to understand both beneficial and adverse effects of treatments for chronic illness on HRQoL and individual factors that affect health  outcomes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380107 Health, Clinical and Counselling Psychology</field><field name="subject">780108 Behavioural and cognitive sciences</field><field name="subject">prostate cancer</field><field name="subject">homonal treatment</field><field name="subject">quality of life</field><field name="subject">cognitive function</field><field name="subject">chronic illness</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:10605</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Getting The Priorities Right: Stakeholder Involvement For A Holistic View Of Research And Extension Priorities In The Australian And Brazilian Dairy Industries</field><field name="creator">Teixeira, Sergio Rustichelli</field><field name="description">Globalisation causes continual change in the dairy industry, creating new opportunities and risks in countries, states, and regions. To survive and benefit from these changes,  stakeholders from across each country's dairy industry need to co-operate to develop alternatives for their regions. The Australian and Brazilian dairy Research, Development and Extension  (R,D&amp;E) organisations recognise this need in their mission statements. They also have some initiatives for more effective interaction with the stakeholders in their dairy industries. In the  1990s Australia created Regional Dairy Programs, including a Subtropical Dairy Program (SDP) for tropical and subtropical areas of east Australia, to gather demands from the production regions in  order to design R,D&amp;E. To promote interaction between R,D&amp;E efforts and agricultural industries the Australian government matches expenditure on R,D&amp;E dollar for dollar. The Brazilian  Agricultural Research Corporation for Dairy (Embrapa Dairy) developed the Platform Project, with the objective of identifying constraints on dairy development in Brazil's main dairy production  regions. Embrapa Dairy has also moved researchers to those regions to establish a link between stakeholders and the head research station in the design of R&amp;D. There remains room for  improvement in both countries' methods. In Australia's SDP, priorities for R,D&amp;E are identified by regional teams consisting mostly of farmers and R,D&amp;E people, but an evaluation has  recommended involving a broader range of stakeholders to increase the diversity of ideas. In Brazil, dairy R&amp;D priorities are identified mostly through quantitative surveys with farmers or  panels of experts who consider large regions (of more than three states), without deeper involvement of farmers. Models and approaches in extension and systems thinking offer ideas for more  effective and comprehensive approaches. The objectives of this study were to: 1. Develop a strategy to: - Involve a broad set of stakeholders in a dairy community to obtain a holistic view of their  priorities for R,D&amp;E, and - Help R,D&amp;E people to understand the dairy farms and the production realities of small regions. 2. Document and compare the R,D&amp;E priorities of dairy  stakeholders in one Australian and two Brazilian regions, including the views of different groups of stakeholders within each region. Regional studies were conducted in three dairy regions, one  region in the north coast of New South Wales, Australia, and two regions in Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. The research method within each region studied combined three approaches, each involving  a variety of stakeholders from across the production communities. These were familiarisation through staying on a farm and building trust; individual interviews with a diversity of stakeholders  from farmers to off-farm enterprises and R,D&amp;E staff, and focus group interviews with participants selected from those already interviewed individually. The focus groups verified and enlarged  upon the findings of the individual interviews, and enabled convergence among the participants' views. The three approaches produced complementary results. The strategy for eliciting R,D&amp;E  priorities worked equally well in all three case studies. Across the three cases, the individual interviews pointed out previously unrecognised R,D&amp;E priorities, going beyond production  technologies into issues such as communication, farm management, labour and finance. Pasture issues also remained important. The results from the focus group interviews corroborated communication,  farm management and finance as important priorities for R,D&amp;E, while adding marketing, industry policy and organisation of farmers, issues which had not stood out originally in the individual  interviews in any of the three regions studied. This suggests a number of things. In terms of strategy for developing R,D&amp;E priorities, both individual interviews and group processes are  valuable, and may provide somewhat different outcomes. Further, the primary information needs for the industry lie beyond the farm and production technologies. The results also show that  stakeholders would like R,D&amp;E people to work as their partners in improving the dairy industry. The involvement of a broader range of stakeholders brought a more holistic and integrated view of  each region's dairy development needs. It was particularly useful to engage people from throughout the dairy community with R,D&amp;E practitioners in identifying priorities, since this broadened  the picture of needs and showed the relative importance of production technologies alongside other, previously unrecognised needs. The results also suggest that research organisations should  include staff capable of taking a more systemic view of dairy production systems, on- and off-farm, and potentially other industries. The academic significance of this study lies in the combination  of systems thinking, stakeholder analysis and participation with extension science, towards a practical need.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">340201 Agricultural Economics</field><field name="subject">dairy industry</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Brazil</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="subject">dairy production</field><field name="subject">dairy farmers</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">stakeholders</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:10387</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Designing a Message Handling Assistant Using the BDI Theory and Speech Act Theory</field><field name="creator">Song, Insu</field><field name="description">This thesis introduces a new approach to designing a Message Handling Assistant (MA). It presents a model of an MA and an intention extraction function for text messages, such as  emails and Newsgroups articles. Based on a speech act theory and the belief-desire-intention (BDI) theory of rational agency, we define a generic MA. By interpreting intuitive descriptions of the  desired behaviours of an MA using the BDI theory and speech act theory, we conjecture that intentions of messages alone provide enough information needed to capture user models and to reason how  messages should be processed. To identify intentions of messages written in natural language, we develop a model of an intention extraction function that maps messages to intentions. This function  is modelled in two steps. First, each sentence in a message is converted into a tuple (performative, proposition) using a dialogue act classifier. Second, the sender's intentions are formulated  from the tuples using constraints for felicitous human communication. As an investigation of the use of machine learning technologies for designing the intention extraction function, four dialog  act classifiers are implemented and evaluated on Newsgroups articles. The thesis also proposes a semantic communication framework, which integrates the agent and Internet technologies for automatic  message composing and ontology exchange services.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280104 Computer-Human Interaction</field><field name="subject">280213 Other Artificial Intelligence</field><field name="subject">280205 Text Processing</field><field name="subject">agent</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">message handling</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:9785</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Asynchronies in Synchronous Baculovirus Infections</field><field name="creator">Haas, Richard</field><field name="description">Baculoviruses are lytic insect viruses. Upon internalisation, the viral genome orchestrates a sequential expression process ultimately leading to lysis of the infected cell. Release  of progeny capable of infecting other cells during the process completes the infection cycle. Studies of the infection cycle in cell culture are typically conducted by synchronous infection, i.e.  near simultaneous infection of all cells, by means of high virus concentrations. The behaviour of the synchronously infected culture, such as the timing of onset of progeny release, is considered  representative for the infection progression within individual cells. In reality, however, the synchronously infected culture only reflects the average behaviour of all infected cells. The  infection progresses in individual cells display large variability; this is most obvious in the observation that within the same culture some cells undergo cell lysis at two days post infection  while others remain viable up to four days post infection. Such variabilities or asynchronies observed in synchronously infected culture is the topic of this thesis. Using a simple phenomenological  model, it is demonstrated that cell death and associated intracellular product release is adequately described assuming that the waiting time from infection to cell death follows a Gaussian  distribution with a mean of 59 hours post infection (hpi) and a standard deviation of 15hpi. Unlike other deterministic models developed over the last decade (Licari and Bailey 1992; Nielsen 2000),  this stochastic model does not make the biologically inconsistent assumption that cells continue to be metabolically active following loss of membrane integrity. While elegant in its simplicity,  the model provides no explanation for the underlying stochasticity. Investigations into the cause of this dispersion of cell death highlighted further asynchronies in the specific recombinant  protein yield, in viral DNA content, in virus budding rate, and in cell volume increase instead of clarifying the issue. A modelling framework developed by Licari &amp; Bailey (1992) and later Hu  &amp; Bentley (2000) incorporates the number of infectious particles each individual cell receives as a possible source of the dispersions in the host cell responses. However, this was found NOT to  be the cause of the observed asynchronies under non-substrate limiting conditions. The timing of cell death, cell volume increase, recombinant product yield, viral DNA content, and virus budding  rate is identical in Sf9 cell cultures infected at multiplicities of infection of ~5, ~15, and ~45 infectious particles per cell. Cell cycle variation has previously been suggested as a possible  cause for observed asynchronies in baculovirus infections (Brown and Faulkner, 1975). The cell cycle phase is indirectly linked to the cell volume, because a G_2-phase cell prior to division is  inherently twice the cell volume of a G_1- phase cell after cell division. By the same logic, it is also apparent that a G_2-phase cell possesses twice the number of ribosomes of a G_1-phase cell  and thus a doubled protein production capacity. The effect of the cell cycle or cell volume on the baculovirus infection was determined by splitting an exponentially growing Sf9 cell culture into 5  cell size dependent fractions by centrifugal elutriation. The subsequent infection of these fractions showed (1) no dependency of the timing of cell lysis and cell volume increase and (2)  approximately twofold increase of a) recombinant protein yield, b) viral DNA concentration, and c) budded virus yield. The recombinant protein yield showed a strong proportionality to the initial  cell volume and the total RNA concentration during the late phase of the infection. As argued in chapter 6, these proportionalities suggest that the observed differences in the responses of the  cell fractions to the baculovirus infection are more likely caused by the difference in the protein production capacity than by cell cycle specific molecules. This investigation gave also reason to  speculate that infected cells cannot progress beyond the G_2/M phase, and cell cycle progression continues undisturbed until ~8hpi when all cellular DNA replication appears to cease. Resuspended,  infected Sf9 cells synchronised by centrifugal elutriation showed an identical cell cycle distribution as the non-infected control cultures for the first ~8hpi; G_1 and G_2/M phase cell proportions  remained unchanged, whereas S phase cells progress to G_2/M phase. Subsequently, the non-infected control cells resumed normal cycling whereas all infected cells remained at the same cell cycle  phase from 8 to 11hpi. The initial cell cycle arrests in G_2/M phase in both infected and non-infected cultures were caused through medium exchange.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270304 Infectious Agents</field><field name="subject">290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="subject">670700 Industrial Chemicals and Related Products</field><field name="subject">baculoviruses</field><field name="subject">lytic insect viruses</field><field name="subject">lysis</field><field name="subject">infection cycle</field><field name="subject">cell death</field><field name="subject">asynchronies</field><field name="subject">cell cycle variation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:9753</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling Diffraction in Optical Interconnects</field><field name="creator">Petrovic, Novak S.</field><field name="description">Short-distance digital communication links, between chips on a circuit board, or between different circuit boards for example, have traditionally been built by using electrical interconnects - metallic tracks and wires. Recent technological advances have resulted in improvements in the speed of information processing, but have left electrical interconnects intact, thus creating a serious communication problem. Free-space optical interconnects, made up of arrays of vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers, microlenses, and photodetectors, could be used to solve this problem. If free-space optical interconnects are to successfully replace electrical interconnects, they have to be able to support large rates of information transfer with high channel densities. The biggest obstacle in the way of reaching these requirements is laser beam diffraction. There are three approaches commonly used to model the effects of laser beam diffraction in optical interconnects: one could pursue the path of solving the diffraction integral directly, one could apply stronger approximations with some loss of accuracy of the results, or one could cleverly reinterpret the diffraction problem altogether. None of the representatives of the three categories of existing solutions qualified for our purposes. The main contribution of this dissertation consist of, first, formulating the mode expansion method, and, second, showing that it outperforms all other methods previously used for modelling diffraction in optical interconnects. The mode expansion method allows us to obtain the optical field produced by the diffraction of arbitrary laser beams at empty apertures, phase-shifting optical elements, or any combinations thereof, regardless of the size, shape, position, or any other parameters either of the incident optical field or the observation plane. The mode expansion method enables us to perform all this without any reference or use of the traditional Huygens-Kirchhoff-Fresnel diffraction integrals. When using the mode expansion method, one replaces the incident optical field and the diffracting optical element by an effective beam, possibly containing higher-order transverse modes, so that the ultimate effects of diffraction are equivalently expressed through the complex-valued modal weights. By using the mode expansion method, one represents both the incident and the resultant optical fields in terms of an orthogonal set of functions, and finds the unknown parameters from the condition that the two fields have to be matched at each surface on their propagation paths. Even though essentially a numerical process, the mode expansion method can produce very accurate effective representations of the diffraction fields quickly and efficiently, usually by using no more than about a dozen expanding modes. The second tier of contributions contained in this dissertation is on the subject of the analysis and design of microchannel free-space optical interconnects. In addition to the proper characterisation of the design model, we have formulated several optical interconnect performance parameters, most notably the signal-to-noise ratio, optical carrier-to-noise ratio, and the space-bandwidth product, in a thorough and insightful way that has not been published previously. The proper calculation of those performance parameters, made possible by the mode expansion method, was then performed by using experimentally-measured fields of the incident vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser beams. After illustrating the importance of the proper way of modelling diffraction in optical interconnects, we have shown how to improve the optical interconnect performance by changing either the interconnect optical design, or by careful selection of the design parameter values. We have also suggested a change from the usual 'square' to a novel 'hexagonal' packing of the optical interconnect channels, in order to alleviate the negative diffraction effects. Finally, the optical interconnect tolerance to lateral misalignment, in the presence of multimodal incident laser beams was studied for the first time, and it was shown to be acceptable only as long as most of the incident optical power is emitted in the fundamental Gaussian mode.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">291702 Optical and Photonic Systems</field><field name="subject">700302 Telecommunications</field><field name="subject">optical interconnect</field><field name="subject">diffraction</field><field name="subject">mode expansion method</field><field name="subject">orthogonal expansion</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:9769</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recreational Exposure To Freshwater Cyanobacteria: Epidemiology, Dermal Toxicity And Biological Activity Of Cyanobacterial Lipopolysaccharides</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Ian</field><field name="description">Cyanobacteria are common inhabitants of freshwater lakes and reservoirs throughout the world. Under favourable conditions, certain cyanobacteria can dominate the phytoplankton within a waterbody and form nuisance blooms. Case reports and anecdotal references dating from 1949 describe a range of illnesses associated with recreational exposure to cyanobacteria: hay fever-like symptoms, pruritic skin rashes and gastro-intestinal symptoms (the latter probably related to ingestion of water) are most frequently reported. Some papers give convincing descriptions of allergic responses to cyanobacteria; others describe more serious acute illnesses, with symptoms such as severe headache, pneumonia, fever, myalgia, vertigo and blistering in the mouth. A U.S. coroner recently found that a teenage boy died as a result of accidentally ingesting a neurotoxic cyanotoxin from a golf course pond; this is the first recorded human fatality attributed to recreational exposure to cyanobacteria. One of the main public health concerns with exposure to freshwater cyanobacteria relates to the understanding that some blooms produce toxins that specifically affect the liver or the central nervous system. The route of exposure for these toxins is oral, from accidental or deliberate ingestion of recreational water, and possibly by inhalation. Cyanobacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are also reported to be putative cutaneous, gastrointestinal, respiratory and pyrogenic toxins. The aims of this project were to enhance the understanding of public health issues relating to recreational exposure to cyanobacteria by conducting epidemiological and laboratory-based toxicology studies. A prospective cohort study of 1,331 recreational water users was conducted at various sites in southern Queensland, the Myall Lakes area of New South Wales, and central Florida. The study design sought to make improvements over previously published epidemiological studies, in that an unexposed group was recruited from cyanobacteria-free waters, cyanobacterial toxins were measured in site water samples, and respondents were asked to rate the severity of reported symptoms. This study has shown an increased likelihood of symptom reporting amongst bathers exposed to high cyanobacterial cell density (measured by total cell surface area) compared to those exposed to low cyanobacteria-affected waters. Mild respiratory symptoms appear to be the predominant symptom category. A clinical dermatology study to examine delayed-contact hypersensitivity reactions to cyanobacterial extracts was conducted. The study groups were 20 patients presenting for diagnostic skin patch testing at the Royal Brisbane Hospital's dermatology outpatient clinic; a convenience sample of 20 individuals was recruited from outside the hospital as a control group. One patient developed unequivocal reactions to several cyanobacteria extracts, with no dose-response pattern seen, indicating that the reactions were allergic in nature. A mouse model of delayed-contact hypersensitivity, the mouse ear swelling test, has demonstrated that the purified toxin cylindrospermopsin, a highly water-soluble compound, is capable of producing cutaneous injury. Encrusting lesions were seen on abdominal skin during the induction phase of these experiments. Delayed-contact hypersensitivity reactions were also demonstrated with this toxin. LPS from two non-axenic cyanobacterial samples - Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and Microcystis aeruginosa - were extracted and purified. Thermoregulation studies were performed using a mouse model of rectal temperature measurement. Separate groups of mice were injected with these LPS extracts at two dose levels. Thermoregulation studies were also conducted with purified cyanobacterial toxins: microcystin-LR and cylindrospermopsin and anatoxin-a; cyanobacterial LPS samples purified by collaborators in Adelaide were also investigated for thermoregulation potential. These experiments have shown that the LPS extracts are weakly active when compared with responses to much lower doses of Escherichia coli LPS. Cylindrospermopsin also produces hypothermic responses in mice - comparable to pyrexia in larger mammals - although at a later stage than was seen with LPS extracts. Supplementing the experimental observations of the toxicology and immunotoxicology of cyanobacterial LPS are insights gained from beyond the cyanobacteria literature on the mechanisms of toxicity of different LPS structures. Cyanobacterial LPS was initially suggested to be toxic in the 1970s, at a time when lipid A, the active moiety of LPS, was thought to be identical across all Gram-negative bacteria. More recent work raises questions about the attribution of cutaneous and gastrointestinal illness to cyanobacterial LPS, with the understanding that some bacterial lipid A structures are LPS antagonists, LPS is not toxic by the oral route, and LPS is not reported as a toxin in the clinical dermatology literature. Gut-derived lipopolysaccharides, however, exert potent synergistic effects with a variety of xenobiotic hepatotoxins, and the well-known shock-like syndromes associated with severe cylindrospermopsin and microcystin poisoning deserve further scrutiny from the perspective of immunotoxicology.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321201 Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety</field><field name="subject">321299 Public Health and Health Services not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">730210 Environmental health</field><field name="subject">cyanobacteria</field><field name="subject">blue-green algae</field><field name="subject">epidemiology</field><field name="subject">health effects</field><field name="subject">recreational</field><field name="subject">freshwater</field><field name="subject">recreational water</field><field name="subject">skin</field><field name="subject">cutaneous</field><field name="subject">lipopolysaccharide</field><field name="subject">thermoregulation</field><field name="subject">immunotoxicology</field><field name="subject">innate immunity</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:9880</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecoturismo e Culturas Tradicionais Estudo de Caso: Martim de Sa</field><field name="creator">Sinay, Laura</field><field name="description">Enquanto alguns paises tem o ecoturismo como a sua principal fonte de renda, o Brasil nao explora a atividade de forma planejada, o que resulta, muitas vezes, na degradacao do meio  ambiente e na descaracterizacao da diversidade cultural local.

I focus on theoretical and methodological problems emerging out of studies in southeast Queensland, particularly  the issues of chronology-building and assessment of site integrity. Results of surveys and excavations are presented. Excavations were conducted at the Seven Mile Creek Mound, Mort Creek Site  Complex, Pancake Creek Site Complex, Ironbark Site Complex, Eurimbula Creek 1, Eurimbula Creek 2, Eurimbula Site 1 and Tom's Creek Site Complex. Differences in site structure, content and  chronology are used to establish a framework to describe variability in the regional archaeological record through space and time. Radiocarbon dates and items of European material culture indicate  that occupation of these sites spans from around 4,000 years ago into the post-contact period. Dates were also obtained from several eroding archaeological deposits which were not subject to  excavation. In total, 66 radiocarbon dates are presented from 12 archaeological sites. Radiocarbon determinations are critically assessed to provide a reliable basis for calibrating radiocarbon  dates into an absolute regional chronology. Local marine and estuarine reservoir effects are characterised through a study of known-age marine shell specimens and archaeological shell/charcoal  paired samples. The object of the study was to assess the potential influence of localised variation in marine reservoir effect on accurately dating marine and estuarine shell from archaeological  deposits in the area. Results indicate that the routinely-applied Delta R value of -5 +/- 35 for northeast Australia is wrong. The determined values suggest a minor revision to Reimer and Reimer's  (2000) recommended value for near-shore open marine environments in northeast Australia from Delta R= +11 + 5 to +12 +/- 7, and specifically for central Queensland to Delta R= +10 +/- 7. In  contrast, data obtained from estuarine shell/charcoal pairs demonstrate a general lack of consistency, suggesting estuary-specific patterns of variation in terrestrial carbon input and exchange  with the open ocean. Preliminary data indicate that in some estuaries, at some time periods, a Delta R value of more than -155 +/- 55 may be appropriate. Radiocarbon determinations, stratigraphy  and bivalve conjoin analyses are used to evaluate the integrity of the open shell midden deposits investigated for the project. Methods for identifying and interpreting bivalve conjoins in  archaeological shell assemblages are developed and tested. Results indicate that contrary to the cautions of Lourandos (1996, 1997), the open sites studied exhibit a high degree of vertical and  horizontal integrity. Results suggest continuous restructuring of settlement-subsistence systems in the region throughout the late Holocene. A regional trajectory towards increased site occupation,  intensity of site use, and localisation of resource use is identified. A three-phase cultural chronology is developed for the region which proposes initial occupation before 4,000 years ago and  significant changes in resource use after 1,500 BP, including the widespread appearance of shellfishing and changes in stone raw material sources. Phase I (pre-4,000 BP-c.1,500 BP) saw ephemeral  coastal occupation by groups which occasionally used coastal resources as part of a diffuse and highly-mobile settlement strategy covering a broad area. Land-using groups may have been primarily  based around the predictable resources of major rivers such as the Boyne. Phase II (c.1,500 BP-c.AD 1850s) is characterised by intensive permanent and structured low mobility strategies throughout  the coastal zone. This phase is defined by a localisation in the use of resources. Extremely large, low density archaeological sites are established throughout the region on the lower margins of  major estuaries and smaller resources extraction sites are also established. Phase III (c.AD 1850s-c.AD 1920s) saw the emergence of post-European mobility systems. Despite disappearing from the  European historical record for the area, Aboriginal people continued to use traditional camping places well into the period of European settlement. Results are discussed in the wider context of key  themes in archaeological cultural chronologies proposed for southeast Queensland and adjacent regions which emphasise recent changes in settlement and subsistence strategies linked to intensifying  patterns of regional land-use. Patterns identified on the southern Curtis Coast generally concur with other findings from southeast Queensland, suggesting major restructuring of coastal occupation  strategies in the late Holocene and especially the last 1,000 years.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">780107 Studies in human society</field><field name="subject">archaeology</field><field name="subject">southeast Queensland</field><field name="subject">9ndigenous</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal</field><field name="subject">Agnes Water</field><field name="subject">Town of Seventeen Seventy</field><field name="subject">Bustard Bay</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:9630</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Under the Boards: The Study of Archaeological Site Formation Processes at the Commissariat Store Site, Brisbane</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Karen Jane</field><field name="description">The study of archaeological site formation processes, although commonly undertaken in prehistoric sites, is only carried out in historical archaeological sites in a limited way.  Understanding the processes which formed the archaeological record of a site is an important first step towards developing justifiable inferences about past behaviour and past societies regardless  of the age of the site. This thesis identifies and examines the cultural and noncultural processes that formed the archaeological record at the Commissariat Store, in Brisbane, Australia. The  history of the site, from its construction in 1829 as part of the Moreton Bay penal settlement to the present, is examined and the expected impacts and processes on the archaeological record are  identified. The archaeological evidence from the salvage excavation of the site undertaken in 1978/79 is analysed to identify the cultural and noncultural site formation processes. This study  identified the presence of the cultural formation processes of discard, loss, abandonment and re-use from an examination of the historical and archaeological evidence. Non-cultural formation  processes at work in the site include faunalturbation, floralturbation, flooding and aquaturbation. This research also identified deficiencies in Schiffer's model for identifying and categorising  cultural formation processes. The activity of construction of the site's drainage system did not clearly fit within a single type of formation process. Water as a formation agent is only discussed  in the literature as a non-cultural formation process, while at this site water can be seen as a cultural formation process. This thesis demonstrates the value and importance of understanding site  formation processes as a firm basis for future interpretation of the archaeology of the Commissariat Store site.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430101 History - Australian</field><field name="subject">430205 Historical Archaeology (incl.

Data for the analysis of the relationships between socioeconomic factors and tree management behaviour and intentions and the construction of a typology of rural households in Leyte was gathered from four case study communities on the Island. Following focus group discussions in each of the participating communities to gather background data and populate the structured interview schedule, representative samples of 50 households were selected and interviewed in each of the four communities. Analysis of the present tree management activities of households in the four communities revealed that most households surveyed (approximately 80%) indicated that they are presently managing at least a few trees, the primary purpose of most tree management activities being to supply timber for the households' own needs. Only 10% of respondents indicated that they intend to sell trees they are presently managing, and 25% stated that they intend to plant and manage trees for the production of timber for sale in the future. Approximately 60% of responding households indicated an interest in developing commercial tree farming on the land they manage. Thus it is concluded that small-scale commercial tree growing is uncommon in the communities involved in the survey, and that many households are interested in developing their tree planting and management activities but feel constrained from participation by various factors. The first level of exploration of the socioeconomic factors affecting rural households' tree management behaviour involved univariate analyses of the relationships between households' tree management behaviour and intentions, their socioeconomic characteristics and their attitudes to forestry. The level of resources controlled by the household, in terms of the area of the land managed by the household, their tenurial security and their cash income, are correlated with higher levels of participation in forestry activities, and greater intentions to plant higher numbers of trees in the future. Some farming system variables are also related to higher levels of tree planting and management activity, including the management of livestock and of farm plots distant from their house. While control over higher than average levels of productive resources are, in general, positively correlated to the active management of trees on their land, there are patterns of exceptions to this trend. The exploration of the interrelationships between socioeconomic factors and attitudes affecting households' tree management behaviour was undertaken through the definition of a typology of rural households in relation to forestry. Five types were defined, each having different attitudes to forestry activities. The interpretation of the types was undertaken by describing and comparing the socioeconomic and behavioural characteristics of the types in the typology. The types were characterised by differences in their control of productive resources, differences in their present and intended levels and types of forestry activity, and by differences in their participation in training activities run by development programs. The characteristics of the types were found to correspond highly with descriptions of the socioeconomic factors affecting forestry activities of smallholder households reported by previous studies into and theories about the socioeconomic factors affecting smallholder forestry development. The typology of rural households does help to describe and interpret the variation within each of the four communities in terms of households' attitudes to forestry development and their socioeconomic characteristics. It is concluded that these variations between households mean that the various types of households will be affected in different ways by forestry development programs. It is also concluded that the present state of forestry policies and the market for timber products is such that substantial increase in the level of forestry activity by smallholders is unlikely without comprehensive land use planning, policy reform in regards to tree registration and transport permits, and market development. Recommendations for further research and policy development arising from the thesis focuses on the need to create enabling conditions in which forestry activities can occur and on ways to address the differing needs of the various types defined in the typology.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">370102 Social Policy and Planning</field><field name="subject">300600 Forestry Sciences</field><field name="subject">340202 Environment and Resource Economics</field><field name="subject">720302 Assistance and protection</field><field name="subject">300604 Management and Environment</field><field name="subject">620399 Forestry not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">forestry</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">Leyte Province</field><field name="subject">Philippines</field><field name="subject">rural households</field><field name="subject">tree management</field><field name="subject">case studies</field><field name="subject">typology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:9474</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Out of the Box: Popular Notions of Archaeology in Documentary Programs on Australian Television</field><field name="creator">Nichols, Stephen James</field><field name="description">In this thesis I investigate the relationships between mass media and popular notions of archaeology in Australia, and consider the implications of these relationships for the public  outreach strategies of Australian archaeologists. First, I review the limited survey data available regarding public opinions of archaeology in Australia, together with the results from more  extensive surveys conducted in North America. These surveys suggest that popular perceptions of archaeology include a variety of misconceptions that are incongruous with the ethical goals of the  profession. Second, I develop a theoretical model of mass media that articulates the nature of the relationships between the producers of mass media and their audiences. This model predicts that  widespread popular notions of archaeology are likely to be reflected in the texts of mainstream mass media. Third, I present the results of a content analysis study undertaken in relation to  archaeological documentary programs screened on Australian television, demonstrating that a number of misconceptions about archaeology are strongly reinforced by these programs. This suggests that  such misconceptions are deeply entrenched within contemporary Australian society.

Firstly, each of the writers will be discussed in turn, along with the implications of their choice to use the format of a chronicle to record the past. Then, their sources of information will be examined, because all four chronicles do not have access to the same quantity of information from parts of the world other than Spain. After these matters are dealt with, we will analyse the way in which changing political and social realities affect the presentation of historical events in our chronicles, including the use of appropriate technical terms. Finally, the treatment of religious issues will be examined, and once again we will see how the changes of their times altered the style of these chronicles. In all of this, it is apparent that attitudes in Spain to the recent past changed during this period, because of the political, religious, economic, and social upheavals caused by the disappearance of the Roman Empire in Spain and the rise of the kingdom of the Visigoths.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430108 History - European</field><field name="subject">medieval Spain</field><field name="subject">chronicles</field><field name="subject">Hydatius of Lemica</field><field name="subject">John of Biclaro</field><field name="subject">Isidore of Seville</field><field name="subject">Chronicle of Zaragoza</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:9250</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-Financial Returns of Enterprise-Led Development Assistance - A Study of Energy-Related Enterprises</field><field name="creator">Kolominskas, Chaim</field><field name="description">The Rural Energy Enterprise Development (REED) initiative provides assistance to energy-related enterprises to prepare them for growth and to make eventual investments by          mainstream financial partners less risky.

This study concludes that desired development outcomes should provide the basis for programme objectives against which          non-financial returns can be measured. However, qualitative information is also necessary, as the context within which an enterprise operates largely defines the importance of these          returns. Further work to improve the understanding of this context is necessary prior to the development of a formalised monitoring programme. Limitations of the assessment process should          be recorded and addressed through the ongoing review of the programme, other monitoring efforts and further research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300800 Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">291104 Environmental Technologies</field><field name="subject">300903 Sustainable Development</field><field name="subject">non-financial returns</field><field name="subject">enterprise led development assistance</field><field name="subject">sustainable development</field><field name="subject">REED</field><field name="subject">small scale energy production</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:9112</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Complex Co-Evolutionary Systems Approach to the Management of Sustainable Grasslands: A Case Study in Mexico</field><field name="creator">Martinez-Garcia, Alejandro N.</field><field name="description">The complex co-evolutionary systems approach (CCeSA) provides a well-suited framework for analysing agricultural systems, serving as a bridge between biophysical and          socioeconomic sciences, allowing for the explanation of phenomena, and for the use of metaphors for thinking and action. By studying agricultural systems as self-generated, hierarchical,          complex co-evolutionary farming systems (CCeFSs), one can investigate the interconnections between the elements that constitute CCeFSs, along with the relationships between CCeFSs and other          systems, as a fundamental step to understanding sustainability as an emergent property of the system. CCeFSs are defined as human activity systems emerging from the purposes, gestalt,          mental models, history and weltanschauung of the farm manager, and from his dynamic co-evolution with the environment while managing the resources at his hand to achieve his own multiple,          conflicting, dynamic, semi-structured and constrained purposes. A sustainable CCeFS is described as one that exhibits both enough fitness to achieve its multiple, dynamic, constrained,          semi-structured, and often incommensurable and conflicting purposes while performing above threshold values for failure, and enough flexibility to dynamically co-evolve with its changing          biophysical and socioeconomic environment for a given future period. Fitness and flexibility are essential features of sustainable CCeFSs because they describe the systems' dynamic capacity          to explore and exploit its dynamic phase space while co-evolving with it. This implies that a sustainable CCeFS is conceived as a set of dynamic, co-evolutionary processes, contrasting with          the standard view of sustainability as an equilibrium or steady state. Achieving sustainable CCeFSs is a semi-structured, constrained, multi-objective, and dynamic optimisation management          problem with an intractable search phase space, that can be solved within the CCeSA with the help of a multi-objective co-evolutionary optimisation tool. Carnico-ICSPEA2, a Co-Evolutionary          Navigator (CoEvoNav) used as a CCeSA's tool for harnessing the complexity of the CCeFS of interest and its environment towards sustainability, is introduced. The software was designed by          its end-user - the farm manager and author of this thesis - as an aid for the analysis and optimisation of the "San Francisco" ranch, a beef cattle enterprise running on temperate pastures          and fodder crops in the central plateau of Mexico. By combining a non-linear simulator and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with a deterministic and stochastic framework, the          CoEvoNav imitates the co-evolutionary pattern of the CCeFS of interest. As such, the software was used by the farm manager to "navigate" through his CCeFS's co-evolutionary phase space          towards achieving sustainability at farm level. The ultimate goal was to enhance the farm manager's decision-making process and co-evolutionary skills, through an increased understanding of          his system, the co-evolutionary process between his mental models, the CCeFS, and the CoEvoNav, and the continuous discovery of new, improved sets of heuristics. An overview of the          methodological, theoretical and philosophical framework of the thesis is introduced. Also, a survey of the Mexican economy, its agricultural sector, and a statistical review of the Mexican          beef industry are presented. Concepts such as modern agriculture, the reductionist approach to agricultural research, models, the system's environment, sustainability, conventional and          sustainable agriculture, complexity, evolution, simulators, and multi-objective optimization tools are extensively reviewed. Issues concerning the impossibility of predicting the long-term,          detailed future behaviour of CCeFSs, along with the use of simulators as decision support tools in the quest for sustainable CCeFSs, are discussed. The rationale behind the simulator used          for this study, along with that of the multi-objective evolutionary tools used as the makeup of Carnico-ICSPEA2, are explained. A description of the "San Francisco" ranch, its key on-farm          sustainability indicators in the form of objective functions, constraints, and decision variables, and the semi-structured, multi-objective, dynamic, constrained management problem posed by          the farm manager's planned introduction of a herd of bulls for fattening as a way to increase the fitness of his CCeFS via a better management of the system's feed surpluses and the          acquisition of a new pick-up truck are described as a case study. The tested scenario and the experimental design for the simulations are presented as well. Results from using the CoEvoNav          as the farm manager's extended phenotype to solve his multi-objective optimisation problem are described, along with the implications for the management and sustainability of the CCeFS.          Finally, the approach and tools developed are evaluated, and the progress made in relation to methodological, theoretical, philosophical and conceptual notions is reviewed along with some          future topics for research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">230118 Optimisation</field><field name="subject">300901 Farm Management, Rural Management and Agribusiness</field><field name="subject">300903 Sustainable Development</field><field name="subject">complexity</field><field name="subject">sustainability</field><field name="subject">co-evolution</field><field name="subject">multi-objective optimization</field><field name="subject">multi-objective evolutionary algorithms</field><field name="subject">farming systems management</field><field name="subject">decision support systems</field><field name="subject">simulation modelling</field><field name="subject">beef cattle production from grasslands</field><field name="subject">Mexico</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:9094</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stones, Bones and Homes: An Examination of Regionality in the Iron Age Settlements and Landscape of West Wales</field><field name="creator">Mate, Geraldine L.</field><field name="description">West Wales in the Iron Age contained a diverse range of settlement types, from hill-forts to unenclosed farmsteads, with the dominant type of settlement the enclosed          farmstead. However, a recent review of information available for the British Iron Age identified a relative lack of systematised information for Wales and consequently there is a pressing          need to re-examine the settlement record for this area, as the belief in a single Iron Age "culture" gives way to recognition of regional difference in material cultures, social          institutions and life-ways. This thesis examines the settlements and landscape of West Wales in an attempt to contribute to our understanding of this region in the Iron Age. In order to          make a regionally synthesised investigation of the social, I conducted a survey of excavation and survey information for Iron Age settlements in West Wales. Analysis centred on examining          the spatial patterning of settlements by considering the morphology, distribution, placement and structure of settlements, their place in the landscape and regional trends in the          structuring of space and artefacts. The investigation was contextualised within the wider body of material for the Iron Age in Britain. The use of landscape theory as an interpretive          framework in examining the spatial patterning of the material culture in the Iron Age proved an effective method for interpreting domestic settlements within the lived landscape. Social and          cosmological relations within settlements and within the referential structuring of a landscape, particularly with respect to pre-existing monuments, were suggested by the analysis. By          comparing these trends in the structuring of settlements within the landscape to settlements elsewhere in Britain, a distinct and regional culture for the Iron Age of West Wales was          identified.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">370402 Social and Cultural Geography</field><field name="subject">430203 Archaeology of Complex Societies - Europe, the Mediterranean and the Levant</field><field name="subject">Iron Age</field><field name="subject">Wales</field><field name="subject">Britain</field><field name="subject">landscape</field><field name="subject">archaeology</field><field name="subject">settlement</field><field name="subject">hillfort</field><field name="subject">enclosed</field><field name="subject">prehistory</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:8996</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Uncovering Mill Point: Understanding Concepts of Space at Australian Historic Sawmills</field><field name="creator">Rae, Emma M.</field><field name="description">In this thesis I use a predictive modelling framework to explore the use of space at nineteenth and early twentieth century Australian sawmills. Sawmills were a key component of  early European settlement in heavily forested areas and are often associated with the development of significant infrastructure, such as roads and rail and sea transport networks. Despite their  importance and potential for enhancing our understanding of early European communities, few studies have been undertaken on historical sawmills in Australia, particularly in relation to spatial  organisation on a comparative level. A dataset of 20 nineteenth and early twentieth century sawmills was analysed and sawmills were found to fall into one of four main types ranging from small  scale temporary establishments (Type A) to large, permanent sawmills with multi-faceted settlements and permanent infrastructure and support services (Type D). Analysis also revealed that sawmill  features were spatially organised into industrial, intermediate and domestic zones. The model is applied to a case study, the Mill Point sawmill in southeast Queensland and results suggest a  general validity of the predictive model and point to directions for further refinement and development. The study has implications for future studies of early industrial enterprises in  Australia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">439900 Other History and Archaeology</field><field name="subject">sawmills</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">space</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="subject">spatial organisation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:8766</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Things to Think With: Understanding Interactions with Artefacts in Engineering Design</field><field name="creator">McGarry, Ben</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:8728</field></doc><doc><field name="title">All the Small Things: The Refinement of Foraminiferal Analysis to Determine Site Formation Processes in Archaeological Sediments</field><field name="creator">Rosendahl, Daniel</field><field name="description">Foraminifera are single cell protozoa that are ubiquitous in marine environments. The hard casings, or tests, of foraminifera are routinely studied in the earth sciences, particularly for palaeoenvironmental information. Foraminifera have been little studied by archaeologists, however, despite their potential to contribute to understandings of coastal site formation processes and localised palaeoenvironments. In this study techniques and methods of foraminiferal analysis are developed and applied to the problem of distinguishing between natural and cultural marine shell deposits, using the Mort Creek Site Complex, central Queensland, as a case study. Results allow unambiguous demarcation of the natural and cultural deposits studied based on patterns of foraminiferal density. Natural deposits were found to have more than 1000 foraminifera per 100g of sediment, while cultural deposits exhibited less than 50 foraminifera per 100g of sediment. The range of taxa represented in the foraminiferal assemblage is consistent with a shallow water sub-tropical marine ecosystem, indicating general environmental stability throughout the period of deposit formation. Findings are applied to re-evaluate previous models of site formation at the Mort Creek Site Complex.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430207 Archaeological Science</field><field name="subject">foraminifera</field><field name="subject">archaeology</field><field name="subject">taphonomy</field><field name="subject">site formation processes</field><field name="subject">Mort Creek Site Complex</field><field name="subject">Rodds Peninsula</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:8757</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gidyea Fire: A Study of the Transformation and Maintenance of Aboriginal Place Properties on the Georgina River</field><field name="creator">Long, Stephen</field><field name="description">In this thesis a platform of knowledge is provided for the development of enhanced Indigenous cultural heritage legislation by examining the specific nature of the cultural heritage of a Queensland Aboriginal group, the Dajarra Aboriginal community of Northwest Queensland for whom the Georgina River is a heartland in their cultural geography. The thesis was conducted during a period when the Queensland Government began to recognize demands for more effective Indigenous cultural heritage legislation. Queensland's latest Aboriginal cultural heritage legislation, introduced in 2004, emerged from a history of legislation dominated by an archaeological model of cultural heritage. However, despite some improvements this new legislation has maintained a physically orientated model of cultural heritage. Therefore Queensland's Indigenous societies, their places, place knowledge and certain types of place-specific behaviours continue to be exposed to imposed change. The thesis examines the 'lifeworld', the 'everyday' experiences of place of the Dajarra community. A broad definition of culture and an interactive model of place, coupled with a phenomenological approach provide a theoretical framework to engage with and describe cultural heritage as Dajarra people themselves experience it. The cultural heritage of Dajarra people involves interactions with a diversity of places and various combinations of behavioural, knowledge and physical properties. All of the places examined were interrelated with other places to form both small and large-scale place complexes. This dissertation reveals that the cultural heritage of an Aboriginal community lies not just in the physical environment but also in the diverse everyday people-environment interactions of that community. Effective cultural heritage legislation must be capable of encompassing this diversity. Cultural heritage is essentially dynamic, it is found in processes of change, it is found in ongoing people-environment interactions as well as those of the past. It is argued that Aboriginal people hold 'active cultural heritage rights'; these are rights to interact with places and rights to control action in places. Ideal cultural heritage legislation would recognize these active rights and provide for Aboriginal control of them, that is, Aboriginal defined and controlled change. This study reveals that it is difficult to separate places in time and space from other places with which they are co-dependent or inextricably intertwined. Studies of Aboriginal people-environment interactions and legislative measures must respond to the broader place complexes within which individual places are embedded and within which the everyday experiences of place are had. It is shown that there is a range of ways that an Aboriginal cultural heritage community can be defined and a range of Aboriginal people that might have interests in the cultural heritage of an area. Lastly, the thesis calls for the adoption of an interactive model of place as a foundation to cultural heritage studies and legislation in order to respond to the cultural heritage of Aboriginal people as they themselves experience it and wish to experience it.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="subject">750309 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander development and welfare</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal cultural heritage</field><field name="subject">place</field><field name="subject">place theory</field><field name="subject">Dajarra</field><field name="subject">Georgina River</field><field name="subject">people-environment interactions</field><field name="subject">Waluwarra</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal environments</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:8675</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expression of Non-Collagenous Proteins by the Epithelial Rest Cells of Malassez</field><field name="creator">Rincon, Julio C.</field><field name="description">Epithelial rest cells of Malassez (ERM) are small groups of epithelial cells within the periodontal ligament closely approximated to the radicular cementum surface. The cells have a  high nuclear/cytoplasm ratio. In oblique sections of the periodontal ligament, the cell rests can be seen, not as isolated groups of cells but as a network, similar to a fish-net, surrounding the  root. The function of the ERM is unknown and their participation in some dental pathological conditions is still controversial. Some new publications have described the isolation of ERM from human  periodontal ligaments. To date no publications have described the expression of bone-related proteins by ERM. ERM were cultured and isolated from porcine periodontal ligaments (chapter 2). An  immunohistochemical study was carried out in rat porcine and human periodontal sections using AE1/AE3 antibody. The expression of cytokeratins by ERM was demonstrated in all species (chapter 3).  Characterization and identification of ERM was achieved by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), immunohistochemistry and Western blot. The results demonstrated the epithelial nature of these  cells obtained from the mid radicular third of porcine first deciduous molars (chapter 4). An in vitro study using a semi quantitated RT-PCR technique was carried out in four different types of  porcine periodontal cells (GF, PDLF, ERM and alveolar bone cells). These cell types were compared for the expression of the bone related proteins osteopontin and bone sialoprotein. The strongest  expression of osteopontin was for the ERM compared to alveolar bone cells, PDLF and GF. These results demonstrated for the first time the expression of osteopontin from cultured porcine ERM  suggesting a possible role of these cells in cementogenesis (chapter 5). Finally, emdogain (EMD), an enamel matrix derivative protein, was utilized at different concentrations to stimulate  periodontal ligament cells and determine its role in proliferation, attachment and by RT-PCR expression of osteopontin or bone sialoprotein in vitro (chapter6). EMD demonstrated proliferative and  attachment responses in a dose dependent manner. EMD stimulated the expression of OPN m RNA by porcine ERM and alveolar bone cells. The results contribute to explaining the different regenerative  events associated with EMD in periodontal regenerative therapy. The findings of this study contribute to a broader understanding of possible functions of the ERM and suggests a role for these cells  in cementogenesis by their strong OPN expression.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">210000 Science - General</field><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">320899 Dentistry not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">730112 Oro-dental and disorders</field><field name="subject">Epithelial rest of Malassez</field><field name="subject">Osteopontin</field><field name="subject">Periodontal regeneration</field><field name="subject">Cell culture</field><field name="subject">immunohistochemistry</field><field name="subject">Emdogain</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:8644</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fishers, Gatherers and Hunters on the Moreton Fringe: Reconsidering the Prehistoric Aboriginal Marine Fishery in Southeast Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Ulm, Sean</field><field name="description">In this thesis I present a critical examination of Walters' (1987, 1989, 1992a, 1992c) model of late-Holocene intensification of Aboriginal marine fishing in southeast Queensland,  Australia. I demonstrate significant problems in three premises central to his interpretation of prehistoric cultural change in the region. Firstly, environmental, ethnohistorical and  archaeological evidence do not support the proposition that the coastal lowlands were a marginal landscape for human occupation at any time in the Holocene or that a time-lag occurred between  sea-level stabilisation and Aboriginal occupation of the coast. Nor is there any palaeoecological evidence to support Walters' argument that periods of greater sedimentation occurring around 3,000  BP caused increases in marine resource productivity. Secondly, even if this enrichment did occur it does not correlate with changes documented in the archaeological record from this time. The  occupational chronology demonstrates that significant increases in the number of occupied sites and the rate of site establishment does not occur until around 1,000 BP, some 2,000 years after the  proposed enrichment of Moreton Bay. Finally, there is no consistent pattern of increase through time in the quantity of fish remains recovered from archaeological sites in the region. In  interpreting this evidence I discuss major taphonomic issues and research biases which have played a significant role in structuring the archaeological database for the region. The Holocene  archaeological record of southeast Queensland emerges as much more complex and variable than is generally portrayed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430200 Archaeology and Prehistory</field><field name="subject">430000 History and Archaeology</field><field name="subject">430201 Archaeology of Hunter-Gatherer Societies (incl.

It is motivated by  evidence that the predominant valuation techniques of equity analysts are not associated with improved portfolio performance. Prior research suggests that equity analysts devote considerable  resources into forecasting near-term earnings, but derive target prices from those earnings in an almost arbitrary fashion. In contrast, the valuation techniques in the commercial world are  increasing in sophistication. Around 30 percent of large corporations in the United States and Australia use real options analysis for project evaluation, according to recent surveys.

The Internet is providing an          additional resource for families to access timely and relevant information and advice. However, the experiences and attributes of parents of deaf children who search the Internet for          information and support remain largely anecdotal. This study aims to bridge some of this knowledge gap. Parents of deaf children were recruited to complete two online surveys. The Parent          Survey sought to establish the demographic details and Internet use patterns of parents who use the Internet to search for information about deafness. The online Support Group Survey asked          parents about their experience of participating in online support groups. One hundred and sixty-three respondents completed the Parent Survey. Analysis of the data found Internet use is          unrelated to the age of the parent, the age of their child, where they live or their employment status. Their use of the Internet is also unrelated to the type of hearing loss of their          child, if their child has a cochlear implant or an additional disability or medical condition, or the method of communication used by the child. Education level of the parent, however, does          influence the level of Internet use. Qualitative data indicates the need for unbiased information that is evidence-based on a range of issues that are important for families to make          informed decisions regarding raising a deaf child. Twenty parents responded to the Online Support Group Survey. They participate in online support groups for the wealth of information and          the support and understanding they receive from other parents. All respondents would recommend an online support group to other parents. The respondents indicated that the benefits          significantly outweighed the limitations. The two major issues this study has highlighted is the need for parents of deaf children to receive unbiased and evidence-based information from a          variety of sources, including the Internet and online support groups, and the need to ensure that parents have access to timely and reliable information irrespective of education level,          socio-economic status and ethnicity. This study provides a foundation of knowledge for service providers and hearing professionals developing Internet resources for parents of deaf children          in Australia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">329903 Therapies and Therapeutic Technology</field><field name="subject">321025 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Hearing and Speech</field><field name="subject">online health</field><field name="subject">ehealth</field><field name="subject">telemedicine</field><field name="subject">disabilities services</field><field name="subject">internet</field><field name="subject">parents</field><field name="subject">hearing loss</field><field name="subject">patient education</field><field name="subject">self-help groups</field><field name="subject">social support</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:8364</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Occupational Therapists' Decisions about the Management of Upper Limb Hypertonicity in Children and Adolescents with Cerebral Palsy</field><field name="creator">Rassafiani, Mehdi</field><field name="description">It has been postulated that occupational therapists when choosing an appropriate intervention method, use theoretical and practical knowledge (factors), based upon identifying  client's goals to guide their clinical reasoning. The overall aim of this study was to identify factors and their relative contributions to the decisions occupational therapists make in the  management of upper limb (UL) hypertonicity of children and adolescents with cerebral palsy (CP). Studies about general factors which influence occupational therapists' decision making have been  addressed widely in the literature. However, studying influential factors in specific areas such as in the management of UL hypertonicity of clients with CP is limited. The information obtained  from studies of decision making with other client groups can not readily be generalised as it has been demonstrated that specific task characteristics induce different types of cognitive thinking.  For example, working with clients with orthopaedic problems may induce logical thinking, while practicing with clients with neurological problems promotes intuitive thinking. The management of UL  hypertonicity of clients with CP was chosen as the focus of this study for two main reasons. First, the incidence of CP is high, manifesting in between 1.4 and 2.4 of 1000 live births. Second,  people with CP are one of the major client groups referred to occupational therapy (OT) clinics as outpatients. The literature reviewed highlighted a lack of evidence about what therapists attend  to when making decisions about the management of UL hypertonicity for clients with CP. To identify and evaluate these factors, the current research employed Social Judgment Theory (SJT). This  methodology was selected because it had the capacity to access intuitive thought or tacit knowledge that is very difficult for experienced therapists to explain. Furthermore, SJT is most relevant  in situations where there is no optimal decision. The current study proceeded in five phases. Phases One to Three were conducted to identify the most relevant factors to be used in the case  vignettes necessary for the application of SJT. This process involved a review of the literature, consultation with clinical experts and then involved twelve experienced therapists in a process of  identifying, refining, and ranking the relevant factors in order of priority. As a result of the processes in Phases One to Three 37 factors and their ranked importance were identified. The  identified factors were reduced from 37 to 12 on the basis of ranking, cluster analysis and consultation with experts and appropriate scales identified for their measurement. These factors formed  the basis of Phase Four of this study. In Phase Four 10 sample case vignettes as well as an administration manual were developed and four therapists were asked to make decisions for these cases. On  the basis of therapists' comments, some changes were made in case vignettes and administration manual. Finally, 110 case vignettes were generated randomly (20 were repeated to examine consistency)  for Phase Five of the study. In Phase Five, eighteen occupational therapists (16 females and 2 males), mean age of 36.7 years (SD = 7.6 years) who had worked with people with CP for a mean of 10.4  years (SD = 6.0 years) made decisions for the generated case vignettes. The findings of Phase Five revealed that therapists used three factors mainly in their decisions including severity of  spasticity, wrist and finger posture, and client and family background. They had poor insight into their decision making (r = 0.36) and demonstrated only moderate consistency (r = 0.46). When  therapists were divided into two groups based on their level of performance in respect to therapists' consistency and their ability to discriminate between cases, both groups used severity of  spasticity and wrist and finger posture in their decision making. However, the higher performing group used limitation in passive range of movement and previous intervention in their decision  making, and the low performing group used client and family background.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="subject">clinical reasoning</field><field name="subject">occupational therapy</field><field name="subject">social judgment Theory</field><field name="subject">upper limb</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:8263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Plasma Membrane Calcium-ATPase in Mammary Gland Epithelial Cell Lines and Consequences of its Inhibition in a Model of Breast Cancer</field><field name="creator">Lee, Won Jae</field><field name="description">Ionized calcium (Ca2+), acting as an intracellular messenger, controls numerous biological processes that are essential for life. However, it is also able to convey signals that  result in cell death. The fidelity of Ca2+ as a universal second messenger therefore depends on mechanisms that specifically and dynamically regulate its levels within a cell, as well as maintain  resting intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) very low. One such mechanism for Ca2+ signaling and homeostasis is the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA), which is a primary active Ca2+  transporter that translocates Ca2+ from a low intracellular Ca2+ environment to a high extracellular environment. There are four mammalian PMCA isoforms (PMCA1-4), which are differentially  expressed depending on tissue or cell type. PMCA isoforms possess different sensitivities to biochemical regulation of Ca2+ efflux activity and are also able to subtly alter the dynamics of Ca2+  signals. These properties suggest that the PMCA is not merely a trivial mechanism for Ca2+ extrusion but is influential in contributing to the Ca2+ signaling requirements and unique physiology of  different cells. The indispensable nature of Ca2+ signaling in organs such as the brain, heart and skeletal muscle has been the studied extensively but little is known about the roles and  regulation of Ca2+ in the mammary gland. This is despite the fact that the mammary gland is a site of extensive Ca2+ flux during lactation. However, cumulating evidence indicates that upregulation  of PMCA2 expression in the mammary gland is a major mechanism for milk Ca2+ enrichment. Therefore, the PMCA is likely to be an important mediator of bulk Ca2+ homeostasis in the mammary gland.  Studies in other model systems also suggest that PMCAs may regulate other cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis that are required for normal mammary gland  physiology. These basic cellular processes are also disturbed in breast cancer and hence deregulation of PMCA expression in the mammary gland may have pathophysiological consequences. Previous  studies show that PMCA1 expression is greater in tumorigenic MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells compared to non-tumorigenic MCF-10A human breast epithelial cells. Furthermore, the  expression of PMCA1b and PMCA4b is lower in human skin and lung fibroblasts neoplastically transformed by simian virus 40, compared to non-transformed counterparts. It is therefore hypothesized  that regulation of PMCA isoform expression is disrupted in breast cancer and that inhibition of PMCA expression in an in vitro model of breast cancer has important effects in modulating  intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. This thesis describes the use of real time RT-PCR to compare PMCA isoform mRNA expression in tumorigenic and  non-tumorigenic mammary gland epithelial cells. It demonstrates that particular breast cancer cell lines overexpress PMCA2, an isoform with restricted tissue distribution and which is present in  abundant amounts in the lactating rat mammary gland. Thus, some breast cancers may be characterized by the overexpression of Ca2+ transporters that are normally upregulated during the physiological  course of lactation. The pathophysiological significance of PMCA2 overexpression in breast cancer is uncertain and future investigations should look at whether levels of PMCA isoform expression  correlate with malignancy, prognosis or survival. To address the second hypothesis of this thesis, a stable MCF-7 Tet-off human breast cancer cell line able to conditionally express PMCA antisense  was generated. This strategy was necessary due to the current lack of specific pharmacological inhibitors of the PMCA. This thesis shows that PMCA antisense expression significantly inhibits PMCA  protein expression, while subtly affecting PMCA-mediated Ca2+ efflux without causing cell death. However, it also reveals that inhibition of PMCA expression has major effects in mediating cell  proliferation and cell cycle progression. Moderate changes in PMCA expression and PMCA-mediated Ca2+ transport result in dramatic consequences in MCF-7 cell proliferation. These studies not only  support the supposition that modulation of Ca2+ signaling is a viable therapeutic approach for breast cancer but also suggest that PMCAs are possible drug targets. Alternatively, inhibitors of the  PMCA may act as adjuvants to augment the efficacy of other anti-neoplastic agents like tamoxifen that have been shown to modulate Ca2+ signaling. Since the discovery of a new family of primary  active Ca2+ transporters, which are related to PMCAs, the opportunities in this field of research are very promising.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270199 Biochemistry and Cell Biology not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">320504 Toxicology (incl.

K.</field><field name="description">The present thesis is concerned with the genesis, diffusion, impact and institutionalisation of economic ideas. Despite Keynes's oft-cited comments to the effect that 'the          ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood'(Keynes 1936: 383), and the highly visible          impact of economic ideas (for example Keynesian economics, Monetarism, or economic ideas regarding deregulation and antitrust issues) on the economic system, economists have done little to          systematically explore the spread and impact of economic ideas. In fact, with only a few notable exceptions, the majority of scholarly work concerning the spread and impact of economic          ideas has been developed outside of the economics literature, for example in the political institutionalist literature in the social sciences. The present thesis addresses the current lack          of attention to the spread and impact of economic ideas by economists by drawing on the political institutionalist, sociological, and psychology of creativity literatures to develop a          framework in which the genesis, spread, impact and institutionalisation of economic ideas may be understood. To articulate the dissemination and impact of economic ideas within economics, I          consider as a case study the evolution of economists' conception of the economic agent - "homo oeconomicus." I argue that the intellectual milieu or paradigm of economics is 'socially          constructed' in a specific sense, namely: (i) economic ideas are created or modified by particular individuals; (ii) economic ideas are disseminated (iii) certain economic ideas are          accepted by economists and (iv) economic ideas become institutionalised into the paradigm or milieu of economics. Economic ideas are, of course, disseminated not only within economics to          fellow economists, but are also disseminated externally to economic policy makers and business leaders who can - and often do - take economic ideas into account when formulating policy and          building economic institutions. Important economic institutions are thereby socially constructed, in the general sense proposed by Berger and Luckmann (1966). But how exactly do economic          ideas enter into this process of social construction of economic institutions? Drawing from and building on structure/agency theory (e.g. Berger and Luckmann 1966; Bourdieu 1977; Bhaskar          1979/1998, 1989; Bourdieu 1990; Lawson 1997, 2003) in the wider social sciences, I provide a framework for understanding how economic ideas enter into the process of social construction of          economic institutions. Finally, I take up a methodological question: if economic ideas are disseminated, and if economic ideas have a real and constitutive impact on the economic system          being modelled, does 'economic science' then accurately and objectively model an independently existing economic reality, unchanged by economic theory, or does economic theory have an          interdependent and 'reflexive' relationship with economic reality, as economic reality co-exists with, is shaped by, and also shapes economic theory? I argue the latter, and consider the          implications for evaluating in what sense economic science is, in fact, a science in the classical sense. The thesis makes original contributions to understanding the genesis of economic          ideas in the psychological creative work processes of economists; understanding the ontological location of economic ideas in the economic system; articulating the social construction of          economic ideas; and highlighting the importance of the spread of economic ideas to economic practice and economic methodology.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410401 Design Theory</field><field name="subject">349901 Political

Adolescent Drug Use</field><field name="creator">Smith, Dianna</field><field name="description">Adolescence is a time of great changes, a time where experimentation and exploration is expected and when the values of authority figures are examined and challenged.          Adolescents will experiment and push the boundaries of all aspects of their life in order to find their own place and identity in a world that has changed its expectations of them. Use of          drugs is one of the ways that they do this. Australian adolescents grow up in a society where alcohol and tobacco is an acceptable part of daily life. Their use of drugs is at least on par          with and in some cases exceeds that of the general population. The overall goals of this research were to gain more information on drug use of Australian adolescents, using existing data          sets. This research examined, using a number of different age groups, the differences in adolescent drug use between urban and rural Australia for lifetime use, use in the last year and use          in the last month using the 2002 edition of the Australian School Student Alcohol and Drug (ASSAD) survey series in conjunction with the 2001 National Drug Strategy Household Survey          (NDSHS). It also used these data sets to investigate differences between indigenous adolescents and non-Indigenous adolescents and whether there were any differences in adolescent drug use          across socio-economic status groups. Four hypotheses were developed. The first was that rural adolescents are more likely than urban adolescents to use licit drugs and the second was that          urban adolescents are more likely than rural adolescents to use illicit drugs. Thirdly, that Indigenous adolescents are more likely than non-Indigenous adolescents to use both licit and          illicit drugs and the fourth was that adolescents from low socio-economic status (SES) groups are more likely than adolescents from high SES groups to use licit and illicit substances. The          data offered little support for any of the hypotheses. The hypothesis on rural adolescents being more likely to use licit drugs was supported by the ASSAD surveydata but not the NDSHS. All          other hypotheses were not supported by either of the data sets. While there are aspects of the information from the two data sets that are contradictory making it difficult to prove or          disprove the hypotheses formulated for this research, they highlighted a number of aspects of adolescent drug use. The first of these is that this research supports the premise that rural          adolescent drug use rates are converging with urban drug use rates for younger adolescents. It also highlighted that there are a large number of rural school students who are using alcohol          and cannabis. The ASSAD data also confirmed other Australian research showing that Indigenous adolescents are less likely than their non-Indigenous counterparts to use alcohol. Both data          sets confirmed previous research by indicating that adolescents from the high SES groups are more likely than their counterparts in the lower SES groups to consume alcohol. Further          investigation is needed to find out why the data sets did not substantiate each other and to gain further insight into the consumption of alcohol by Indigenous adolescents and adolescents          from the higher socio-economic status groups. Increasing the samples of Indigenous people in both of the data sets and lobbying the Australian Bureau of Statistics to increase their sample          for the Indigenous Social Survey to include 12-14 year olds should give more information on Indigenous adolescents that could be used in research and prevention activities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">370107 Social Change</field><field name="subject">321200 Public Health and Health Services</field><field name="subject">380106 Developmental Psychology and Ageing</field><field name="subject">321207 Indigenous Health</field><field name="subject">adolescents</field><field name="subject">adolescence</field><field name="subject">illicit drug use</field><field name="subject">Indigenous</field><field name="subject">urban youth</field><field name="subject">rural use</field><field name="subject">alcohol</field><field name="subject">cannabis</field><field name="subject">prevention</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:7806</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Communism and Public Opinion in Queensland, 1939-1951 : An Explanation of Queensland's Vote in the 1951 Anti-Communist Referendum</field><field name="creator">Beatson, Jim</field><field name="description">The starting point of this thesis was a desire to explain the rapid demise in the popularity which the Communist Party enjoyed in Queensland during the second world war. Wartime  Queensland gave the Australian Communist Party its highest state vote and six years later Queensland again gave the Communist Party its highest state vote - this time however, to ban the Party.  From this I was led into exploring the changing policies, beliefs and strategies of the Party, as well as the many sub-groups on its periphery, and the shifts in public response to these. In 1939  Townsville elected Australia's first Communist alderman. Five years later, Bowen elected not only Australia's first but also the British Empire's first, Communist state government member. Of the  five electorates the Australian Communist Party contested in the 1944 Queensland State elections, in none did the Party's candidate receive less than twenty per-cent of the formal vote. Not only  was the Party seemingly enjoying considerable popular support but this was occurring in a State which, but for the Depression years (May 1929 - June 1932) had elected a Labor State Government at  every state election since 1915. In the September 1951 Constitution Alteration Referendum, 'Powers To Deal With Communists and Communism', Queensland regist&#172;ered the nation's highest "Yes" majority  - 55.76% of the valid vote. Only two other states registered a majority in favour of the referendum's proposals, Western Australia and Tasmania. As this research was undertaken it became evident  that while various trends exhibited at the time, anti-Communism, the work of the Industrial Groups, Labor opportunism, local area feelings, ideological shifts of the Party, tactics of Communist-led  unions, etc., were present throughout the entire period, they were best seen when divided into three chronological phases of the Party's history and popularity. The first period covers the  consolidation of the Party's post-Depression popularity during the war years as it benefited from the Soviet Union's colossal contribution to the Allied war efforts, and this support continued for  some six months or so after the war. Throughout the period Communist strength within the trade union movement greatly increased as did total Party membership. The second period was marked by a  rapid series of events starting in March 1946, with Winston Churchill's "Official Opening" of the Cold War by his sweeping attack on Communism and Russia, at Fulton. Several days later the first of  a series of long and bitter strikes in Communist-led unions occurred, as the Party mobil&#172;ized for what it believed would be a series of attacks on the working class from a ruling class, defending a  capitalist system on the verge of an economic collapse. It was a period when the Party believed this ruling class was using Labor reformism as a last desperate 'carrot' to get workers to accept  their lot within a capitalist economic framework. Out of the Meat Strike emerged the Industrial Groups, who waged not only a determined war against Communist trade union leadership but also  encouraged the A.W.U.-influenced State Labor apparatus to even greater anti-Communist antagonisms. The Communist Party's increasing militancy and Labor's resistance to it, ended finally in the  collapse of the Chifley Labor government. Characteristically the third period opens with the Communist Party making an another about-face, desperately trying to form an alliance with the Labor  Party and curbing its former adventurist industrial policy, as it prepared for Menzies' direct assault. The Communist Party's activities were greatly reduced, a function of both a declining  member-ship and, furthermore, a membership reluctant to confront an increasingly hostile society. In examining the changing policies, beliefs and strategies of the Party and the shifts in public  response to these, I have tried to distinguish between general trends occurring within Australia and the national party, and trends peculiar to Queensland and the Queensland branch of the Party,  The Communist Party suffered a decline in support and membership right across Australia throughout this period as a result of the national policies of the Party, and the changing nature of world  politics. There were particular features of this decline that were peculiar to Queensland. I have, however, singled out three features of particular importance throughout the period for a short but  more specifically detailed analysis, than would be possible in a purely chronological study: i.e. the Party's structure, the Party's ideological subservience to Moscow, and the general effect upon  it of the Cold War.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Communism - Queensland</field><field name="subject">Queensland - Politics and government - 1922-1945</field><field name="subject">Queensland - Politics and government - 1945-1965</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:12268</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From Midden to Sieve: The Impact of Differential Recovery and Quantification Techniques on Interpretations of Shellfish Remains in Australian Coastal Archaeology</field><field name="creator">Jenkins, Robyn</field><field name="description">Experimental mechanical sieving methods are applied to samples of shellfish remains from three sites in southeast Queensland, Seven Mile Creek Mound, Sandstone Point and One-Tree, to  test the efficacy of various recovery and quantification procedures commonly applied to shellfish assemblages in Australia. There has been considerable debate regarding the most appropriate sieve  sizes and quantification methods that should be applied in the recovery of vertebrate faunal remains. Few studies, however, have addressed the impact of recovery and quantification methods on the  interpretation of invertebrates, specifically shellfish remains. In this study, five shellfish taxa representing four bivalves (Anadara trapezia, Trichomya hirsutus, Saccostrea glomerata, Donax  deltoides) and one gastropod (Pyrazus ebeninus) common in eastern Australian midden assemblages are sieved through 10mm, 6.3mm and 3.15mm mesh. Results are quantified using MNI, NISP and weight.  Analyses indicate that different structural properties and pre- and postdepositional factors affect recovery rates. Fragile taxa (T. hirsutus) or those with foliated structure (S. glomerata) tend  to be overrepresented by NISP measures in smaller sieve fractions, while more robust taxa (A. trapezia and P. ebeninus) tend to be overrepresented by weight measures. Results demonstrate that for  all quantification methods tested a 3mm sieve should be used on all sites to allow for regional comparability and to effectively collect all available information about the shellfish  remains.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">archaeology</field><field name="subject">Indigenous</field><field name="subject">southeast Queensland</field><field name="subject">recovery techniques</field><field name="subject">shell middens</field><field name="subject">shellfish</field><field name="subject">Seven Mile Creek Mound</field><field name="subject">Sandstone Point</field><field name="subject">One-Tree</field><field name="subject">taphonomy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:12664</field></doc><doc><field name="title">All in Good Time: Exploring Change in Neanderthal Behavioural Complexity</field><field name="creator">Langley, Michelle</field><field name="description">Since their discovery 150 years ago, Neanderthals have been considered incapable of behavioural change and innovation. Traditional synchronic approaches to the study of Neanderthal  behaviour have perpetuated this view and shaped our understanding of their lifeways and eventual extinction. In this thesis I implement an innovative diachronic approach to the analysis of  Neanderthal faunal extraction, technology and symbolic behaviour as contained in the archaeological record of the critical period between 80,000 and 30,000 years BP. The thesis demonstrates  patterns of change in Neanderthal behaviour which are at odds with traditional perspectives and which are consistent with an interpretation of increasing behavioural complexity over time, an idea  that has been suggested but never thoroughly explored in Neanderthal archaeology. Demonstrating an increase in behavioural complexity in Neanderthals provides much needed new data with which to  fuel the debate over the behavioural capacities of Neanderthals and the first appearance of Modern Human Behaviour in Europe. It supports the notion that Neanderthal populations were active agents  of behavioural innovation prior to the arrival of Anatomically Modern Humans in Europe and, ultimately, that they produced an early Upper Palaeolithic cultural assemblage (the Ch&#226;telperronian)  independent of modern humans. Overall, this thesis provides an initial step towards the development of a quantitative approach to measuring behavioural complexity which provides fresh insights into  the cognitive and behavioural capabilities of Neanderthals.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">archaeology</field><field name="subject">Neanderthals</field><field name="subject">Modern Human Behaviour</field><field name="subject">complexity</field><field name="subject">faunal analysis</field><field name="subject">stone artefacts</field><field name="subject">symbolic behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:12665</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental Risk Factors for Parkinson's Disease</field><field name="creator">Gartner, Coral E.</field><field name="description">Parkinson&#8217;s disease (PD) is a progressive, degenerative, neurological disease. The progressive disability associated with PD results in substantial burdens for those with the condition, their families and society in terms of increased health resource use, earnings loss of affected individuals and family caregivers, poorer quality of life, caregiver burden, disrupted family relationships, decreased social and leisure activities, and deteriorating emotional well-being. Currently, no cure is available and the efficacy of available treatments, such as medication and surgical interventions, decreases with longer duration of the disease. Whilst the cause of PD is unknown, genetic and environmental factors are believed to contribute to its aetiology. Descriptive and analytical epidemiological studies have been conducted in a number of countries in an effort to elucidate the cause, or causes, of PD. Rural residency, farming, well water consumption, pesticide exposure, metals and solvents have been implicated as potential risk factors for PD in some previous epidemiological studies. However, there is substantial disagreement between the results of existing studies. Therefore, the role of environmental exposures in the aetiology of PD remains unclear. The main component of this thesis consists of a case-control study that assessed the contribution of environmental exposures to the risk of developing PD. An existing, previously unanalysed, dataset from a local case-control study was analysed to inform the design of the new case-control study. The analysis results suggested that regular exposure to pesticides and head injury were important risk factors for PD. However, due to the substantial limitations of this existing study, further confirmation of these results was desirable with a more robustly designed epidemiological study. A new exposure measurement instrument (a structured interviewer-delivered questionnaire) was developed for the new case-control study to obtain data on demographic, lifestyle, environmental and medical factors. Prior to its use in the case-control study, the questionnaire was assessed for test-retest repeatability in a series of 32 PD cases and 29 healthy sex-, age- and residential suburb-matched electoral roll controls. High repeatability was demonstrated for lifestyle exposures, such as smoking and coffee/tea consumption (kappas 0.70-1.00). The majority of environmental exposures, including use of pesticides, solvents and exposure to metal dusts and fumes, also showed high repeatability (kappas &gt;0.78). A consecutive series of 163 PD case participants was recruited from a neurology clinic in Brisbane. One hundred and fifty-one (151) control participants were randomly selected from the Australian Commonwealth Electoral Roll and individually matched to the PD cases on age (&#177; 2 years), sex and current residential suburb. Participants ranged in age from 40-89 years (mean age 67 years). Exposure data were collected in face-to-face interviews. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using conditional logistic regression for matched sets in SAS version 9.1. Consistent with previous studies, ever having been a regular smoker or coffee drinker was inversely associated with PD with dose-response relationships evident for packyears smoked and number of cups of coffee drunk per day. Passive smoking from ever having lived with a smoker or worked in a smoky workplace was also inversely related to PD. Ever having been a regular tea drinker was associated with decreased odds of PD. Hobby gardening was inversely associated with PD. However, use of fungicides in the home garden or occupationally was associated with increased odds of PD. Exposure to welding fumes, cleaning solvents, or thinners occupationally was associated with increased odds of PD. Ever having resided in a rural or remote area was inversely associated with PD. Ever having resided on a farm was only associated with moderately increased odds of PD. Whilst the current study&#8217;s results suggest that environmental exposures on their own are only modest contributors to overall PD risk, the possibility that interaction with genetic factors may additively or synergistically increase risk should be considered. The results of this research support the theory that PD has a multifactorial aetiology and that environmental exposures are some of a number of factors to contribute to PD risk. There was also evidence of interaction between some factors (eg smoking and welding) to moderate PD risk.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">321202 Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">environmental exposures</field><field name="subject">exposure assessment</field><field name="subject">environmental health</field><field name="subject">Parkinson's disease</field><field name="subject">case-control study</field><field name="subject">neurodegenerative disease</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:12921</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Ecology of Hendra virus and Australian bat lyssavirus</field><field name="creator">Field, Hume E.</field><field name="description">Chapter one introduces the concept of disease emergence and factors associated with emergence.

In a preliminary survey of wildlife, feral and pest species, 6/21 Pteropus alecto  and 5/6 P. conspicillatus had neutralizing antibodies to Hendra virus. A subsequent survey found 548/1172 convenience-sampled flying foxes were seropositive. Analysis using logistic regression  identified species, age, sample method, sample location and sample year, and the interaction terms age*species and age* sample method as significantly associated with HeV serostatus. Analysis of a  subset of the data also identified a significant or near-significant association between time of year of sampling and HeV serostatus. In a retrospective survey, 16/68 flying fox sera collected  between 1982 and 1984 were seropositive. Targeted surveillance of non-flying fox wildlife species found no evidence of Hendra virus. The findings indicate that flying foxes are a likely reservoir  host of Hendra virus, and that the relationship between host and virus is mature. The transmission and maintenance of Hendra virus in a captive flying fox population is investigated in Chapter  four. In study 1, neutralizing antibodies to HeV were found in 9/55 P. poliocephalus and 4/13 P. alecto. Titres ranged from 1:5 to 1:160, with a median of 1:10. In study 2, blood and throat and  urogenital swabs from 17 flying foxes from study 1 were collected weekly for 14 weeks. Virus was isolated from the blood of a single aged non-pregnant female on one occasion. In study 3, a  convenience sample of 19 seropositive and 35 seronegative flying foxes was serologically monitored monthly for all or part of a two-year period. Three individuals (all pups born during the study)  seroconverted, and three individuals that were seropositive on entry became seronegative. Two of the latter were pups born during the study period. Dam serostatus and pup serostatus at second bleed  were strongly associated when data from both years were combined (p&lt;0.001; RR=9, 95%CI 1.42 to 57.12). The serial titres of 19 flying foxes monitored for 12 months or longer showed a rising and  falling pattern (10), a static pattern (1) or a falling pattern (8). The findings suggest latency and vertical transmission are features of HeV infection in flying foxes. Chapter five describes  Australian bat lyssavirus surveillance in flying foxes, insectivorous bats and archived museum bat specimens. In a survey of 1477 flying foxes, 69/1477 were antigen-positive (all opportunistic  specimens) and 12/280 were antibody-positive. Species (p&lt;0.001), age (p=0.02), sample method (p&lt;0.001) and sample location (p&lt;0.001) were significantly associated with fluorescent antibody  status. There was also a significant association between rapid focus fluorescent inhibition test status and species (p=0.01), sample method (p=0.002) and sample location (p=0.002). There was a  near-significant association (p=0.067) between time of year of sampling and fluorescent antibody status. When the analysis was repeated on P. scapulatus alone, the association stronger (p=0.054). A  total of 1234 insectivorous bats were surveyed, with 5/1162 antigen&#8211;positive (all opportunistic specimens) and 10/390 antibody-positive. A total of 137 archived bats from 10 species were tested for  evidence of Australian bat lyssavirus infection by immunohistochemistry (66) or rapid focus fluorescent inhibition test (71). None was positive by either test but 2 (both S. flaviventris) showed  round basophilic structures consistent with Negri bodies on histological examination. The findings indicate that Australian bat lyssavirus infection is endemic in Australian bats, that submitted  sick and injured bats (opportunistic specimens) pose an increased public health risk, and that Australian bat lyssavirus infection may have been present in Australian bats 15 years prior to its  first description. In Chapter six, deterministic state-transition models are developed to examine the dynamics of HeV infection in a hypothetical flying fox population. Model 1 outputs demonstrated  that the rate of transmission and the rate of recovery are the key parameters determining the rate of spread of infection, and that population size is positively associated with outbreak size and  duration. The Model 2 outputs indicated that that long-term maintenance of infection is inconsistent with lifelong immunity following infection and recovery. Chapter seven discusses alternative  hypotheses on the emergence and maintenance of Hendra virus and Australian bat lyssavirus in Australia. The preferred hypothesis is that both Hendra virus and Australian bat lyssavirus are  primarily maintained in P. scapulatus populations, and that change in the population dynamics of this species due to ecological changes has precipitated emergence. Future research recommendations  include further observational, experimental and/or modeling studies to establish or clarify the route of HeV excretion and the mode of transmission in flying foxes, the roles of vertical  transmission and latency in the transmission and maintenance of Hendra virus in flying foxes, and the dynamics of Hendra virus infection in flying foxes.</field><field
