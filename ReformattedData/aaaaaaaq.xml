This thesis presents a design for a portable, flexible high-security architecture based on a traditional computer security model. Behind the API it consists of a kernel implementing a reference monitor which controls access to security-relevant objects and attributes based on a configurable security policy. Layered over the kernel are various objects which abstract core functionality such as encryption and digital signature capabilities, certificate management and secure sessions and data enveloping (email encryption). The kernel itself uses a novel design which bases its security policy on a collection of filter rules enforcing a cryptographic module-specific security policy. Since the enforcement mechanism (&amp;e kernel) is completely independent of the policy database (the filter rules), it is possible to change the behaviour of the architecture by updating the policy database without having to make any changes to the kernel itself. This clear separation of policy and mechanism contrasts with current cryptographic security architecture approaches which, if they enforce controls at all, hardcode them into the implementation, making it difficult to either change the controls to meet application-specific requirements or to assess and verify them. To provide assurance of the correctness of the implementation, this thesis presents a design and implementation process which has been selected to allow the implementation to be verified in a manner which can reassure an outsider that it does indeed function as required. In addition to producing verification evidence which is understandable to the average user, the verification process for an implementation needs to be fully automated and capable of being taken down to the level of running code, an approach which is currently impossible with traditional methods. The approach presented here makes it possible to perform verification at this level, something which had previously been classed as "beyond Al" (that is, not achievable using any known technology). The versatility of the architecture presented here has been proven through its use in implementations ranging from l6-bit microcontrollers through to supercomputers, as well as a number of unusual areas such as security modules in ATMs and cryptographic coprocessors for general-purpose computers.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2310</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enzyme activities associated with gonadotropic hormones</field><field name="creator">Daja, Mirella Maria</field><field name="description">A structural relationship between gonadotropic hormones and certain types of enzymes has been suggested in previous studies and an investigation into the possibility of enzymatic activity associated with the gonadotropic hormones has been the primary focus of the research presented in this thesis. Partial sequence homology between human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and &#945;-chymotrypsin prompted the recent proposal of a tertiary structure of hCG using &#945;-chymotrypsin as a folding template, which suggested the possibility of intrinsic peptidase activity associated with hCG. Highly purified hCG (CR127) was assayed for enzymatic activity against a range of synthetic peptide substrates and was found to exhibit Arg-specific peptidase activity. This activity was almost completely inhibited by diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI), N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) and to a lesser extent by N-&#945;-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK), which indicated that the observed protease activity was serine protease-like. To establish whether this activity was intrinsic to the hormone or due to contaminants, extensive purification procedures were carried out. Hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) and soybean trypsin inhibitor-affinity chromatography were found to effectively separate the protease activity from the hormone, indicating the presence of exogenous protease contaminants in the highly purified preparation of hCG. Further analysis by [3H]-DFP labelling of hCG and SDS-PAGE of the isolated contaminants revealed the presence of possible serine proteases with apparent molecular masses of 60 and 20 kD. Because serine proteases are known to stimulate cAMP production in the same target cells, it was necessary to determine the effects of the contaminating proteases on the receptor binding of hCG and cAMP production. The presence of these contaminants was found to have no apparent effect on the receptor binding capability of hCG, however the in vitro biological activity of hCG as determined by maximal cAMP production was decreased after HIC-HPLC purification of the hormone. These observations suggested that the serine protease-like contaminants contributed to the total cAMP production, thereby introducing significant error in biological assays that use hCG (CR127). The possible intrinsic enzymatic activity of hCG against its receptor as a natural substrate was further investigated. A membrane-bound receptor preparation was isolated from porcine ovaries and a receptor binding assay successfully established. The effects of hCG binding upon the membrane-bound receptor were studied and receptor proteolysis was observed. However, this proteolysis could not be definitively attributed to the actions of hCG. A purified receptor was subsequently prepared by hCG-affinity chromatography and analysed by SDS-PAGE with detection by autoradiography and silver staining. The purified receptor was found to have undergone proteolysis during the purification procedure, presumably following incubation with the hCG affinity matrix. Recent reports of the presence of homologous amino acid sequences in the active site of thioredoxin and the &#946;-subunit of the gonadotropic hormones luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and subsequent demonstration of thioredoxin-like activity associated with these hormones, prompted an investigation into the possibility of thioredoxin-like activity associated with hCG. LH, FSH and hCG were all assayed for their ability to promote reactivation of reduced and denatured RNase. Although LH was shown to be capable of reactivating reduced RNase, the level of activity detected was significantly lower than that previously reported, whereas FSH and hCG were not found to be capable of this thioredoxin-like activity. These results suggested that the previously reported thioredoxin-like activity may be due to contamination of the hormone preparation, by the ubiquitous enzyme thioredoxin. The possibility of LH possessing intrinsic dithiol-disulphide interchange activity was investigated further using [3H]-iodoacetic acid. RNase/LH were incubated in an attempt to quench a dithiol intermediate. Preliminary results suggested that the presence of LH in this reaction increased the amount of protein radiolabelled, however, the isolation of a radiolabelled dithiol intermediate which could be conclusively identified as LH was not forthcoming. Furthermore the lack of RNase reactivation activity in hCG, suggests that the putative thioredoxin-like activity of LH, if intrinsic, may not be involved in receptor activation and/or signal transduction, as hCG and LH share the same receptor and should therefore have a similar mechanism of activation.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2311</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Translation and understanding: mental models as an interface in the process of translation</field><field name="creator">Kikuchi, Atsuko</field><field name="description">This thesis discusses two characteristics of language which affect translation, using English and Japanese examples. However, the general points made in the thesis are not specific to these two languages. One characteristic of language is that it encodes particular perceptions of experience by its users. Word meaning is defined in this thesis in terms of the typical experience the language user associates with a word. Concepts for which there are no single lexical items are encoded by putting together words which the speaker thinks best characterise the concept. This particular characterisation of a concept may become established in the language community. If the members of a language community form a habit of characterising a concept in a particular way, it may become difficult to perceive the concept in any other way. In translation, this may lead the translator to impose characterizations established in her own language on the other language. However, such difficulties can be overcome because of the creative capacity of people everywhere to learn new ways to perceive the world. And language provides the mechanism to encode such novel perception. This is the other characteristic of language discussed in this thesis. We can use an existing word to encode a new kind of experience which we perceive as having some connection with the kind of experience associated with the word. Such novel application of a word can be understood because upon hearing the word, the typical experience associated with the word is evoked in the hearer's mind, and using her knowledge, the hearer constructs a mental model which she thinks best accounts for the combination of experiences evoked in her mind by the linguistic forms. Defining word meaning and sentence meaning in terms of mental images allows us to understand the process of translation: Upon hearing/reading the source language text, the translator constructs a mental model based on the text. She then bases her translation on this mental model, which becomes a rich source of information. Because the translator is not moving directly from one language to the other, no direct correspondences between the linguistic forms of the two languages need to be sought. This also explains why it is relatively easy to translate between two languages whose users share similar experiences and therefore can build similar mental models, even if the languages are typologically very different from each other.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420115 Japanese</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2312</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer into kiwifruit</field><field name="creator">Janssen, Bart-Jan</field><field name="description">A system has been developed to aid in the establishment of Agrobacterium-mediated transformation for new plant species. A series of binary vectors have been constructed that express a chimaeric &#946;-D-glucuronidase (GUS) gene in plants cells but not in bacterial cells. This feature allows GUS activity from transformed plant cells to be assayed in the presence of Agrobacterium. Preliminary experiments examined the expression of these chimaeric GUS genes in transformed petunia leaf discs. GUS expression was detectable 2 days after inoculation, peaked at 3 &#8211; 4 days and then declined; if selection was imposed expression increased again after 10 - 14 days. The amount of expression observed 4 days after inoculation correlated well with stable integration as measured by kanamycin resistance, hormone independence, and gall formation. Histochemical staining of inoculated leaf discs confirmed the transient peak of GUS expression 3 - 4 days after inoculation. Surprisingly, GUS expression was concentrated in localized zones on the circumference of the disc; within these zones essentially all the cells appeared to be expressing GUS. These results suggest that the frequency of gene transfer from Agrobacterium is extremely high within localized regions of the petunia leaf explants, but that the frequency of stable integration is several orders of magnitude lower. A reliable Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system has been established for kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa var. deliciosa cv. Hayward) by using transient expression of GUS to monitor gene transfer frequencies. In vitro culture of kiwifruit plants and conditions for regeneration of plants from leaf discs have been established. Several factors were found to improve gene transfer frequencies in kiwifruit: (i) healthy actively growing source tissue; (ii) the use of Agrobacterium strain A281; (iii) the presence of a layer of moistened filter paper between the leaf explants and the cocultivation media; and (iv) the presence of 20 &#956;M acetosyringone in both the bacterial culture media and in the cocultivation media. Pre-culture of leaf explants significantly inhibited gene transfer, particularly at the cut edge of the explants. Using the optimized transformation system, at least one transgenic plant can be regenerated from each leaf inoculated. Stable transformation frequencies have been shown to vary significantly between different binary vectors. Phenotypic, PCR, and Southern analysis has confirmed the presence of stably integrated T-DNA in several transgenic kiwifruit plants.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Namakir: a description of a central Vanuatu language</field><field name="creator">Sperlich, Wolfgang B., 1948-</field><field name="description">This is a description of the phonology, morphology and syntax of Namakir, a language of the Oceanic subgroup of Austronesian, which is spoken on some six small islands of the Shepherd Islands, central Vanuatu. My perspective on Namakir is that of a person trained in linguistics, who carried out linguistic fieldwork for the purpose of grammatical description. In addition I contributed to ethnographic work as well as compiling data for a dictionary, part of which is appended to the present description. Namakir is a conservative language which retains many features that make Oceanic languages unique. Thus it is a valuable witness for comparative and reconstructive work in Oceanic linguistics. The physical, social and historical setting of Namakir is detailed in the introductory chapter. A section on theoretical issues concerning the descriptive enterprise is included. The chapter on phonology outlines the Namakir consonant and vowel inventories, with due emphasis on the glottal stop which, as a reflex of the Proto-Oceanic glottal stop, is a unique occurence in Vanuatu languages Sections on phonotactics, stress and phonological processes add to the basic description of segments. In the chapter on morphophonemics the dynamics of derivational processes are explored. A major section deals with consonant alternation, a phenomenon widely discussed in Oceanic Linguistics. The major form classes are detailed in the next chapter. Nominals, determiners, adjectives, verbs and adverbs are established as word categories and paradigm tables are provided for comprehensive overviews. The last chapter on Namakir syntax provides a systematic description of noun phrase and verb phrase. Possessive constructions receive special attention as they exhibit a number of unusual features. The verb phrase is discussed within the framework of the Oceanic definition of verb and periphery which include subject markers as well as pronominal objects. The Namakir mood and aspectual system is presented in detail. A major section deals with serial verb constructions in relation to current descriptive theories. The concluding sections discuss selected items regarding complex sentence structures. Negation and question sentences, existential and comparative sentence types are included. Coordination together with direct and indirect speech is noted to use forms of a quotative verb, being especially significant in the organisation of narrative sequences. Relative and temporal clauses share a single overt marker. A morpheme-to-morpheme glossed narrative is appended to demonstrate narrative style. A substantial Namakir-English-Bislama wordlist is added as a repository of data collected during fieldwork.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380200 Linguistics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2314</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Children's Writing in New Zealand Newspapers, 1930s and 1980s</field><field name="creator">Holt, Jill</field><field name="description">This thesis is an investigation of writing by New Zealand children in the Children's Pages of five New Zealand newspapers: the New Zealand Herald, Christchurch Press and Otago Daily Times in the 1930s and 1980s, the Dominion in the 1930s; and the Wellington Evening Post in the 1980s. Its purpose is to show how children reflected their world, interacted with editors, and interpreted the adult world in published writing, and to examine continuities and changes between the 1930s and 1980s. It seeks evidence of gender variations in writing. and explores the circumstances in which the social role of writing was established by young writers. It considers the ways in which children (especially girls) consciously and unconsciously used public writing to create a public place for themselves. It compares major themes chosen by children, their topic and genre preferences in writing, and the gender and age differences evident in these preferences. The thesis is organised into three Parts, with an Introduction discussing the scholarly background to the issues it explores, and its methodology. Part One contains two chapters examining the format and tone of each Children's Page. And the role and influence of their Editors. Part Two (also of two chapters) investigates the origins and motivations of the young contributors, with a special focus on the Otago Daily Times as a community newspaper. Part Three. of four chapters, explores the children's writing itself, in separate chapters on younger and older children, and a chapter on the most popular genre, poetry. The conclusion suggests further areas of research, and points to the implications of the findings of the thesis for social history in New Zealand and for classroom practice. The thesis contains a Bibliography and an Appendix with a selection of writings by Janet Frame and her family to the Otago Daily Times Children's Page in the 1930s.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies::420201 New Zealand literature in English</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2315</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Queueing and Storage Control Models</field><field name="creator">Sheu, Ru-Shuo</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted at the request of the author</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230200 Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2316</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tamarillo mosaic potyvirus: characterization and resistance</field><field name="creator">MacDiarmid, Robin M.</field><field name="description">The export of tamarillo is an important component of the New Zealand, exotic fruit industry. However, the quality of tamarillo fruit is severely decreased by tamarillo mosaic potyvirus (TaMV) which detrimentally affects fruit colour resulting in the fruit being unacceptable on the international marketplace. Virus incidence was surveyed in four tamarillo growing regions. Viruses were detected by indicator plant symptomology, and the incidence confirmed by dot blot analysis or ELISA. TaMV was present in 100% of tamarillo trees analyzed in ten of the twelve orchards surveyed. Incidence of potato aucuba mosaic potexvirus, cucumber mosaic cucumovirus, alfalfa mosaic virus and arabis mosaic nepovirus, which had all been previously reported in tamarillo was also determined. Tomato spotted wilt tospovirus was identified for the first time in tamarillo plants in New Zealand. TaMV RNA was purified from infected tamarillo leaves and a 1600 base pair cDNA clone generated to the 3'-terminus. The clone was sequenced and the location of the gene for the coat protein was identified by direct amino-terminal sequencing of purified TaMV coat protein. Comparison with other potyvirus coat protein sequences established that TaMV represents a new member of the potyvirus group. Seven chimeric transgenes containing TaMV sequences were constructed in three different binary vectors suitable for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of plants. Of the twenty-six independent Nicotiana benthamiana plant lines generated expressing either TaMV coat protein or TaMV RNA sequences modified to block translation, eight plant lines demonstrated resistance to virus infection (more than 10% of resistant plants/line). All plants of one line, PT#25, were resistant to TaMV infection using dilute inocula; 40% were also resistant after inoculation with more concentrated inocula. The level of accumulation of CP in transgenic plant lines did not correspond with the degree of resistance to TaMV infection. In eight of the twenty-six transgenic lines a proportion of plants demonstrated recovery from systemic infection. Recovery was manifested as an absence or significant reduction of virus symptoms in newly developed leaves of plants that had previously shown symptoms of systemic TaMV infection. The mechanism of recovery from systemic infection is discussed. The protocol for the regeneration of transgenic tamarillo by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation was improved. The efficiency of transformation was optimized and the rate of transgenic shoot elongation was increased. Two tamarillo plants transformed with a transgene designed to express the TaMV coat protein were produced and were demonstrated to express the neomycin phosphotransferase gene and TaMV coat protein gene. However, following challenge with a low concentration of inoculum, micropropagants of these tamarillo plants failed to demonstrate resistance to TaMV infection. Three in vitro enzymatic activities of the virus encoded cytoplasmic inclusion protein were studied. The cytoplasmic inclusion protein was purified to near homogeneity using differential centrifugation and sucrose gradient purification. RNA-stimulated ATPase activity was demonstrated and the Km and Vmax determined. RNA binding and energy-dependent dissociation were characterized. RNA helicase activity of the cytoplasmic inclusion protein was demonstrated in the presence of NTP using RNA duplexes with single-stranded overhangs. These results have confirmed and extended the previous findings of the likely RNA helicase function of the potyvirus cytoplasmic inclusion protein, and suggest possible future mechanisms for obtaining resistance to potyviruses.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2320</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Host races and cryptic species in marine symbionts</field><field name="creator">Stevens, Peter M. (Peter Michael)</field><field name="description">The Pinnotheridae is a family of decapod crustaceans comprising more than 120 mostly microphagous and commensal species. As symbionts of a variety of aquatic invertebrates, pinnotherids typically live in an intimate association with their host depending on it for an almost lifelong source of nourishment and shelter, together with a site for mating. The New Zealand pinnotherid fauna was thought to comprise only one species, Pinnotheres novaezelandiae Filhol, associated with a multitude of hosts. Recently, however, a separate species, P. atrinicola Page, has been described which is regarded as being host specific to the horse mussel Atrina zelandica Gray. In this context, the relationship between pea crabs and their hosts is of special interest, and is the focus of this thesis. An investigation into the population dynamics of the symbiotic relationship between P novaezelandiae and its host, the green-lip mussel Perna canaliculus, at Westmere Reef, Auckland between May 1986 and July 1988 is reported. Ovigerous females and Stage I males and females were found throughout the sampling period, indicating that reproduction is continuous in this species. The developmental composition of the pea crab population reveals that soft-shelled males, usually regarded as an anomalous instar, formed a significant component of the pea crab population at all times. It is suggested that these individuals represent a distinct facies, analogous to the Stage II female instar. The presence of a pea crab was found to have a highly significant detrimental effect on mussel condition. Analysis of the distribution of pea crabs among the mussel population indicates mature crabs display a repulsed distribution favouring to live a solitary existence, whereas younger (pre-hard and Stage I) crabs showed a random distribution in broad agreement with a theoretical Poisson distribution. The biological status of the two described taxa was investigated by a survey of electrophoretically detectable genetic variation of populations from throughout the North Island of New Zealand. Pea crabs from 18 host populations from nine geographically disparate localities were subjected to cellulose acetate and poly-acrylamide electrophoresis. Forty-one enzyme systems were screened for polymorphism. Clearly resolved enzyme phenotypes were obtained at 23 presumptive loci, of which l5 exhibited polymorphism. An analysis of electromorph frequency data revealed that both taxa are highly genetically structured and typified by high levels of polymorphism and heterozygosity; results atypical of brachyuran crabs. P- atrinicola was found to exhibit strong patterns of geographic differentiation and clinal variation in electromorph frequency. Of particular significance is the pattern of genetic differentiation observed among populations of p. novaezelandiae. Hierarchical F-statistics indicated that the preponderance of inter-population differentiation can be attributed to differences in electromorph frequency among host-associated populations of P. novaezelandiae within a sampling locality. Geographic differentiation was a comparatively insignificant factor in the structuring of the sampled P. novaezelandiae populations. Individuals belonging to two genetically very distinct units were found within a newly recorded host species, Mactra ovata ovata Gray at Green and Wood Bays, Manukau Harbour. Hardy-Weinberg analyses indicate the host-associated populations of P. novaezelandiae exhibit such a pronounced pattern of homozygote excess and disturbance from genetic equilibrium in sympatry that it is unreasonable to consider them as a single panmictic population. It is concluded that significant biological discontinuities based on host origin exist within the currently recognised taxon. Such a conclusion is supported by data presented on qualitative differences in host recognition observed between different host-associated populations of P. novaezelandiae. Conservatively these discontinuities indicate host race development, although a viable alternate hypothesis would be the presence of cryptic, host-specific biological species within P. novaezelandiae. Hostrace development as found here is a well recognised phenomenon in insect-host and parasitoid-host relationships, although little studied in marine symbiotic relationships. Such a phenomenon has important implications for ecological, behavioural and physiological studies on marine symbionts in general.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2321</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of photoadaptation in the intertidal red alga Gracilaria chilensis</field><field name="creator">Stevens, Michelle Lisa Glogau</field><field name="description">The intertidal red alga, Gracilaria chilensis Bird, McLachlan et Oliveira (Rhodophyta, Gracilariales), lives in an environment in which light is highly variable in terms of both amplitude and duration. A laboratory investigation of the photophysiology of G. chilensis was conducted to assess the response of the photosynthetic apparatus to light variability characteristic of the natural environment. Freshly collected Gracilaria chilensis was found to exhibit an endogenous rhythm of photosynthesis in conditions of constant limiting light and temperature. However, such a phenomenon was not observed in saturating light. Rhythms of phycobiliprotein concentration and dark respiration were also observed but were not as well-defined and could nor account for the photosynthetic rhythm. The photosynthetic response of G. chilensis to light fluctuations of various durations (0.25 to 900 seconds) and light levels was compared to that in static light. G. chilensis was able to utilise rapidly fluctuating light (&lt; 1 second) more efficiently than fluctuations of longer duration (60-900 second). Mean photosynthetic rates were enhanced by up to l50% in fluctuating light of less than 60 sec duration over that predicted from steady-state. The photosynthetic apparatus of freshly collected G. chilensis was found to have many low-light "shade" acclimation characteristics. These included a low compensation point (5 &#181;molm-2 s-l) and onset of saturation (80 &#181;molm-2 s-l) suggesting sensitivity to photoinhibition. However, (laboratory) low-light acclimated G. chilensis was able to tolerate periods of constant high light (2000 &#181;molm-2 s-l)for periods of six hours without detectable detrimental effect on photosynthetic capacity, although photosynthetic efficiency was significantly inhibited after two hours of this treatment. The time course and characteristics of photoacclimation were determined by culturing G. chilensis in low- (15 &#181;mol m-2 s-l) and high- (180 &#181;mol m-2 s-l) light and high- and low-nitrogen regimes. The observed change in photosynthetic characteristics and pigment concentration indicated that acclimation began after a time lag of l-2 days, was complete after approximately a week and was reversible. Acclimation to growth light included changes in growth rate, P-I response curves, pigment concentration and composition and other biochemical components (e.g. carbon/nitrogen ratio). The nitrogen regime significantly affected pigment concentration in the high-light grown plants and the response suggests pigments play a role in nitrogen storage as well as light harvesting. These various physiological characteristics described above were interpreted as important mechanisms that enable G. chilensis to optimise photosynthetic response in the highly dynamic and stressful zone of the intertidal environment.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2322</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of Symmetric Forced Oscillators</field><field name="creator">Ben-Tal, Alona</field><field name="description">In this thesis we study a class of symmetric forced oscillators modeled by non-linear ordinary differential equations. Solutions for this class of systems can be symmetric or non-symmetric. When a symmetric periodic solution loses its stability as a physical parameter is varied, and two non-symmetric periodic solutions appear, this is called a symmetry breaking bifurcation. In a symmetry increasing bifurcation two conjugate chaotic attractors (i.e.,attractors which are related to each other by the symmetry) collide and form a larger symmetric chaotic attractor. Symmetry can also be restored via explosions where, as a physical parameter is varied, two conjugate attractors (chaotic or periodic) which do not intersect are suddenly embedded in one symmetric attractor. In this thesis we show that all these apparently distinct bifurcations can be realized by a single mechanism in which two conjugate attractors collide with a symmetric limit set. The same mechanism seems to operate for at least some bifurcations involving non-attracting limit sets. We illustrate this point with examples of symmetry restoration in attracting and non-attracting sets found in the forced Duffing oscillator and in a power system. Symmetry restoration in the power system is associated with a phenomenon known as ferroresonance. The study of the ferroresonance phenomenon motivated this thesis. Part of this thesis is devoted to studying one aspect of the ferroresonance phenomenon the appearance of a strange attractor with a band-like structure. This attractor was called previously a 'pseudo-periodic' attractor. Some methods for analyzing the non-autonomous systems under study are shown. We construct three different maps which highlight different features of symmetry restoring bifurcations. One map in particular captures the symmetry of a solution by sampling it every half the period of the forcing. We describe a numerical method to construct a bifurcation diagram of periodic solutions and present a non-standard approach for converting the forced oscillator to an autonomous system.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2323</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Variables affecting choice behaviour: choice behaviour and deprivation</field><field name="creator">Temple, William</field><field name="description">Pigeons were studied in concurrent chain schedules in which the terminal links were variable-interval (aperiodic) and fixed-interval (periodic) schedules.

An understanding of their wider context is essential to an understanding of the sites themselves, so a study is made of European artillery and fortification practice and technology from the 14th century onwards, with an emphasis on the coastal artillery practices of the British Empire in the 19th century. On this foundation, coastal fortification practices in New Zealand in the 19th century are examined, and the political background to the construction of coastal forts is outlined. The social and economic impact of the defences are studied, and the resources used in their construction detailed. Land acquisitions for the defence works in Auckland are examined. With a thorough understanding of their background and context (both national and international), Forts Resolution, Bastion, Takapuna, Victoria, Cautley and the submarine mining depots are then studied in detail, with limited excavations, extensive field survey, and the use of comprehensive archival sources. Fina1ly, it, is concluded that the forts built in Auckland between 1885 and 1925 were a product of the colonial experience, in that, they were a complex technological product of imperial demands and needs, and had little relevance to the realities and requirements of a small and remote colony 20,000 km away from the imperial centre. The thesis is a study of the &#8216;disappearing gun&#8217; period of coastal fortification, and also an acknowledgement that much of the evidence of this once socially and economically significant activity has been destroyed. To assist the reader, there is a large bibliography, and appendices containing a comprehensive glossary, a list of New zealand defence schemes from 1840 to 1914, a list of site record numbere, and biographical details of the key fort builders.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemistry of low-valent osmium</field><field name="creator">Grundy, Kevin Rodger</field><field name="description">This study concerns the synthesis, structure and reactivity of complexes of d&#8310; and d&#8312; osmium. The reactivity of certain ligands coordinated to low-valent osmium has also been investigated. Various hydride complexes of osmium(II) were prepared as potential precursors of osmium(O). OsH&#8324;(PPh&#8323;)&#8323; reacts with p-tolylisocyanide (TIC) and 4-ethyl-2,6,7-trioxa-1-phosphabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (ETPO) to yield OsH&#8322;(L)(PPh&#8323;)&#8323; from which were derived OsH&#8322;(L&#8217;)(L)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322; (L, L&#8217;=CO, TIC, ETPO). Attempts to eliminate hydrogen from the dihydrides failed. OsHCl(CO) (PPh&#8323;)&#8323; reacts with neutral ligands L (=TIC, ETPO, P(OMe)&#8323;, P(OPh)&#8323;, PPh&#8322;Me) to give OsHCl(CO)(L)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322; which, with silver perchlorate (L=TIC, ETPO only) afford OsH(OClO&#8323;)(CO)(L)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322;.

OsHCl(CO)(PPh&#8323;)&#8323; reacts with silver perchlorate in acetonitrile to yield [OsH(CO)(CH N)&#8322;(PPh&#8323;)&#8322;]ClO4, which in turn reacts with neutral ligands to give [OsH(CO)(CH&#8323;N)(L)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322;]ClO&#8324; (L=CO, TIC, ETPO, PPh&#8323;). Cationic [OsH(CO)&#8322;(PPh&#8323;)&#8323;]+ and [OsH(TIC)&#8322;(PPh&#8323;)&#8323;]+ can be prepared from the action of PPh&#8323; on [OsH(CO)&#8322;(CH&#8323;N)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322;]+ and TIC on OsH(O&#8322;CCH&#8323;)(PPh&#8323;)&#8323; respectively. With base, [OsH(CO)(CH&#8323;N)(PPh&#8323;)&#8323;]ClO4 affords OsH(OH)(CO)(PPh&#8323;)&#8323; from which a series of hydroxide complexes OsH(OH)(CO)(L)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322; (L=CO, TIC ETPO) can be obtained. The hydroxide group in OsH(OH)(CO)(PPh&#8323;)&#8323; is cleaved by acids HX to yield OsHX(CO)(PPh&#8323;)&#8323; (X=F, Br, Cl, I, CH&#8322;, CF&#8322;, SC&#8327;H&#8327;, OClO&#8323;).

Theoretically, it draws mainly upon the concept of ideology as interpreted by Jorge Larrain but also upon Gramsci's concept of hegemony, the notion of social amnesia as presented by Jacoby and the concept of resistance as developed by Giroux. It also examines the historical development of the concepts of 'race' and 'culture' which are employed ideologically to rationalize educational policies concerning the Maori. Tracing the progression of policies and practices in Maori education from the 1830s to the present day, the research shows the schooling of the Maori to have contributed significantly to the securing of Pakeha economic and political dominance in the nineteenth century and to the maintenance of that dominance through much of the twentieth century. Of particular significance has been the control of Maori access to knowledge. With Maori resistance playing a considerable part in the shaping of these policies and practices, the school is recognized as one of the sites of Maori-Pakeha struggle. Widespread underachievement of Maori within education - revealed in 1960 by the Hunn Report - is recognized as an outcome of these processes. Taking account of policies in recent years directed at improving Maori educational achievement, the thesis examines fieldwork research conducted within Auckland primary and secondary schools, in order to understand the extent to which current policies and practices of schools contribute towards overcoming the asymmetry in social relations. Focussing upon teacher perceptions of Maori children and their needs, the way schools sort and classify their pupils, provisions for a Maori dimension in schooling, including 'taha Maori', and the place of history in social studies programmes, the research finds that the struggle still continues, with tensions surrounding the efforts of the minority of teachers and other educationists working within the education system towards Maori interests. While a significant number of teachers, particularly in primary schools seem concerned to implement the 'taha Maori' policy and other aspects of 'multicultural education', these efforts are not matched by a concern to address the problem of Maori educational under-achievement, with teachers either explaining away the problem or accepting it as a quasi-natural state of affairs. Over all the research shows that schools in general continue, in a variety of ways, to control and limit Maori access to knowledge-power and thereby help to maintain the asymmetry in Maori-Pakeha relations. Maori children who do succeed within the education system are seen to do so primarily because they and their families have learned to deal with the system. The multicultural policies of education as presented by the Department of Education are recognized as ideological responses to Maori resistance and challenges, creating an appearance of change and of commitment to Maori interests while, in essence, functioning to maintain the asymmetry in social relations.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2328</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bile salt-stimulated human milk lipase characterisation and kinetic studies</field><field name="creator">Cleverly, Douglas Robert</field><field name="description">Chapter One begins with an introduction to enzymology and leads into a discussion on BSSL beginning with the physical properties and the source of the enzyme. The literature concerning the kinetic properties of BSSL is reviewed, followed by a discussion on how the structure of enzymes influences their catalytic activity and specificity. The use of X-ray crystallographic techniques is addressed as a means of elucidating the three dimensional structure of enzymes. The chemicals, apparatus and standard methodologies used in this present investigation are described in Chapter Two. The means by which kinetic data measured for an enzyme-substrate system are analysed and compared are also discussed. Chapter Three describes the purification of bile salt-stimulated human milk lipase (BSSL) from whole human milk. A detailed study of the activity of the purified protein has been conducted against both lipid and ester substrates in order to monitor the progress of the purification. A further determination of the physical properties of the protein has also been conducted. Results from these studies have identified the protein as BSSL. In Chapter Four the methods used for determining the partial amino acid sequence of the enzyme are described. This study has revealed interesting homologies with enzymes from other species. The sequence of that part of the enzyme which includes the active site has been determined and has been found to be identical to the consensus sequence found in the active site of pancreatic lipase, serine proteases and cholinesterases. It may therefore be postulated that the similarity observed for some of the kinetic behaviour of enzymes arises from homology in their amino acid sequences and, in particular, those portions of the protein comprising the active site. The use of kinetic isotope effects, to gain insight as to the mechanism of BSSL catalysed hydrolysis of lipid substrates, is the subject of Chapter Five. A mechanism has been proposed which explains the observed effects and takes into account information from the literature. The mechanism also incorporates findings made from the amino acid sequence study and the literature reports on the residues involved in catalysis. Chapter Six begins within a literature survey of detergent less microemulsions and continues with an account of the kinetic properties of BSSL in this new and novel medium in which enzymic reactions involving substrates of low water solubility may be conducted. The advantage of this medium is that it allows one to monitor the reaction by spectrophotometric means. In more traditional methods of assay of lipid substrates this is not normally possible. This advantage has also been exploited in the study of the kinetics of BSSL against triolein in reversed micelles, which is the subject of Chapter Seven. A detailed description is given of an FT-IR technique which allows one to monitor the course of reaction of biologically important substrates.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2329</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geology of the Coromandel region with emphasis on some economic aspects</field><field name="creator">Skinner, D. N. B. (David N. B.)</field><field name="description">An account is given of the early geological exploration and mining history of the Coromandel Goldfield. The writer's interpretation of the basement and igneous geology, and of the metallogenesis of gold-silver and base metal ores has resulted in radical changes. The original threefold sub-division of the Jurassic sedimentary basement rocks (Manaia Hill Group) has been condensed to two formations (Tokatea Hill and Manaia Hill) on the basis of their detrital content and structure; standard sections are described. The older (Manaia Hill Formation) is characterised by lithic volcanic greywacke- and subgreywacke-type sedimentary rocks, that were derived from a landmass comprising an assemblage of calc-alkaline volcanic and plutonic rocks, with minor sedimentary rocks. The deposit was formed by turbidity currents on a continental slope bordering a geosyncline. Secondary minerals diagnostic of low grade metamorphism of the Zeolite and Prehnite-Pumpellyite Facies occur locally in the Manaia Hill Formation. These not only include normal prehnite, laumontite-leonhardite, analcime, and actinolite, but also prehnite with anomalously low refractive indices. In contrast, the rocks of the younger formation (Tokatea Hill) are feldspathic greywackes almost devoid of volcanic detritus except near the formation boundary with Manaia Hill Formation. They have a sericiterich, authigenic matrix, but no zeolites or prehnite. The sediments were derived from a landmass of low relief composed of granodiorite-diorite plutonic rocks and minor sedimentary rocks. The lower parts of the formation are slope turbidites while the upper parts are the product of stable deposition in deeper water. The structure of the Manaia Hill Group is relatively simple over most of the Coromandel area. The beds have a north-west to north-north-west strike and are folded about axes with a similar trend; joint directions corroborate this conclusion. A north-east trend has been imposed on the rocks of the Moehau region by the intrusion of Paritu Quartz-diorite. Conformity between the two formations is shown by gradational detrital content and by structural continuity. In older descriptions, the volcanic rocks of Coromandel were subdivided into an older, gold-bearing, and a younger, barren series of andesites with minor dacites and rhyolites. By ignoring post-eruptional properties (i.e. hydrothermal alteration) a different view of the volcanic stratigraphy is demonstrated. The extrusive rocks are now subdivided into nine formations with no major regional break but with disconformity or unconformity between them caused by local quiescence. With the addition of two intrusive formations with volcanic affinities (Castle Rock Dacite and Kai-iti Porphyrites) all the volcanic rocks are included together as the Coromandel Group of Miocene age. The new effusive formations from oldest youngest are: Port Charles Andesite; Omoho Formation (rhyolitic); Kokumata Dacite; Te Karaka Andesite; Cousin Jack Andesite; Parakete Formation (dacite-andesite); Rauporoa Basaltic-andesite; Tuateawa Andesite; and Beesons Island Volcanics (andesite-dacite). The last formation has been considerably redefined since it is the sole surviving name from earlier published descriptions of the volcanic geology. Two zeolites (phillipsite and levyne) are described. Hydrothermal alteration and mineralisation cut across formation boundaries and are controlled by fault and shear zones. The writer, unlike earlier workers, recognises faults as important in the development of the geology. The fracture pattern in the basement rocks not only controls the regional fault pattern but also the fracture pattern in the volcanic rocks immediately overlying the basement. Stress patterns have been synthesised from structural analyses of faults, shears, veins, and gold-bearing lodes, which suggest that since the Mesozoic, a major compressional stress has been directed approximately north-east/south-west. A local secondary stress (north-north-west/south-south/east) is indicated during the mid-Tertiary. Major late Tertiary normal fault movement is explained by postulating horizontal tension relief by gravity following differential vertical movement along pre-existing faults, as a result of doming induced by intrusion and eruption of magma. A regional gravity survey has been tied to the known geology and structure. Models of possible mass distribution are computed for individual Bouguer anomalies. Major geological features are confirmed but stations are too spread to relate mineralisation with the gravity pattern. The results of a stream sediment reconnaissance geochemical survey of cold extractable and total copper, lead, and arsenic, are appraised in relation to known geological structural and historical features. The effects of pH, flocculants, and contamination are considered and the analytical methods reviewed. The standards of anomalous concentration levels are statistically calculated, and related to different possible sources of metal within a given terrain. Recommendations for further exploration and analytical work are made for those areas where possible economic mineralisation has been detected. In particular, the Moehau region near Paritu Quartz-diorite shows strong signs of copper enrichment. No examples of ore from any of the old mines were available; the study of the sulphide mineralisation has been confined to outcrops of veins, and samples from tip-heads. Although many of the samples show indefinite mineral relationships, the similarity of paragenetic sequence for all areas suggests that the deductions for the whole field are valid. Several minerals have not been previously recorded from Coromandel, notably wolframite, molybdenite, pyrrhotite and tetrahedrite. The structural control of mineralisation by the fracture pattern is emphasised, and also the absence of any direct genetic relationship to the volcanic rocks of the Coromandel Group. Instead, there is a zonal genetic relationship of the ore minerals of the Moehau region about Paritu Quartz-diorite. The similarity of the paragenetic sequence of other deposits to that of the Moehau region suggests similar sources, i.e. hydrothermal exhalations from consolidating subjacent granodiorite-type plutons. Whilst future economic prospects for Coromandel itself my depend on deeper workings approaching such bodies, the Paritu Quartz-diorite pluton could contain a more accessible porphyry copper deposit, with associated tungsten and molybdenum minerals.</field><field name="date">1967</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2330</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Science/Fiction of Sex. A Feminist Deconstruction of the Vocabularies of Heterosex</field><field name="creator">Potts, Annie</field><field name="description">This research conducts a feminist poststructuralist examination of the vocabularies of heterosex: it investigates those terms, modes of talking, and meanings relating to sex which are associated with discourses such as scientific and popular sexology, medicine and psychiatry, public health, philosophy, and some feminist critique. The analysis of these various representations of heterosex involves the deconstruction of binaries such as presence/absence, mind/body, inside/outside and masculine/feminine, that are endemic to Western notions of sex. It is argued that such dualisms (re)produce and perpetuate differential power relations between men and women, and jeopardize the negotiation of mutually pleasurable and safer heterosex. Particular attention is paid to the ways in which sexological discourse deploys such dualisms as normal/abnormal, natural/unnatural, and healthy/unhealthy sex, and produces specifically gendered 'experiences' of sexual corporeality. The thesis examines a variety of written texts and excerpts from film and television; it also analyzes transcript material from individual and group interviews conducted by the researcher with heterosexual women and men, as well as sexual health and mental health professionals, in order to identify cultural pressures influencing participation in risky heterosexual behaviours, and also to identify alternative and safer pleasurable practices. Some of these alternative practices are suggested to rely on a radical reformulation of sexual relations which derives from the disruption of particular dualistic ways of understanding and enacting sex. The overall objective of the thesis is to deconstruct cultural imperatives of heterosex and promote the generation and acceptance of other modes of erotic pleasure. It is hoped that this research will be of use in the future planning and implementation of sex education and safer sex campaigns in Aotearoa/New Zealand which aim to be non-phallocentric and non-heterosexist, and which might recognize a feminist poststructuralist politics of sexual difference.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420303 Culture, gender, sexuality</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2331</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ethnomathematics: Exploring Cultural Diversity in Mathematics</field><field name="creator">Barton, Bill, 1948-</field><field name="description">This thesis provides a new conceptualisation of ethnomathematics which avoids some of the difficulties which emerge in the literature. In particular, work has been started on a philosophic basis for the field. There is no consistent view of ethnomathematics in the literature. The relationship with mathematics itself has been ignored, and the philosophical and theoretical background is missing. The literature also reveals the ethnocentricity implied by ethnomathematics as a field of study based in a culture which has mathematics as a knowledge category. Two strategies to over come this problem are identified: universalising the referent of &#8216;mathematics&#8217; so that it is the same as &#8220;knowledge-making&#8221;; or using methodological techniques to minimise it. The position of ethnomathematics in relationship to anthropology, sociology, history, and politics is characterised on a matrix. A place for ethnomathematics is found close the anthropology of mathematics, but the aim of anthropology is to better understand culture in general, while ethnomathematics aims to better understand mathematics. Anthropology, however, contributes its well-established methodologies for overcoming ethnocentricity. The search for a philosophical base finds a Wittgensteinian orientation which enables culturally based &#8216;systems of meaning&#8217; to gain credibility in mathematics. A definition is proposed for ethnomathematics as the study of mathematical practices within context. Four types of ethnomathematical activity are identified: descriptive, archaeological, mathematising, and analytical activity. The definition also gives rise to a categorisation of ethnomathematical work along three dimensions: the closeness to conventional mathematics; the historical time; and the type of host culture. The mechanisms of interaction between mathematical practices are identified, and the imperialistic growth of mathematics is explained. Particular features of ethnomathematical theory are brought out in a four examples. By admitting the legitimacy of other viewpoints, ethnomathematics opens mathematics to new creative forces. Within education, ethnomathematics provides new choices, and turns cultural conflict into a useful tool for teaching. Mathematical activity exists in a variety of contexts. Learning mathematics involves being aware of, and integrating, diverse concepts. Ethnomathematics expands mathematical horizons, so that cultural diversity becomes a richer contributor to the cultural structures which humans use to understand their world.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2332</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Signalling mechanisms coordinating nutritional status and lactation</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Kevin William</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted at the request of the author.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2333</field></doc><doc><field name="title">General practice consultation and outcome: a social analysis of the patient practitioner encounter</field><field name="creator">Raymont, Antony</field><field name="description">The thesis examines general medical practice with particular attention to patient outcomes. Sociological descriptions of healing are presented and compared with official views of medical institutions. A theoretical position is taken capable of interaction with the disciplines of both sociology and medicine. Definitions of health are reviewed and used to specify desirable outcomes to patient-practitioner encounters. The context of modern medical care is then discussed; the influence of the intellectual, social and economic environment on the development of medical care since 1800 are evaluated, and modern reformist pressure on medical practice is examined. From this discussion a list of qualities of interest in the sociological investigation of medical practice is developed. A research project, undertaken in New Zealand, is described which gathered information on a random sample of 9477 general practice patient-practitioner encounters. A survey methodology was used with data supplied by practitioners. In addition, a patient survey was carried out in a sub-sample of 763 visits. Data on practitioner, patient, problem presented, process of the encounter and outcome was recorded. Outcome was measured as empowerment at the visit and improvement after two weeks. The results of the project are presented and analyzed. It was found that most patients are satisfied with their consultation and that a majority have improved health state at two weeks. Much of the variation in improvement is explained by the severity of the problem and the age of the patient. Social variables make a small contribution to the prediction of good outcomes. In particular, empowerment at the consultation is related to improved subsequent health state. The influence of occupation, gender and ethnicity on problems presented to the practitioner and on outcome are discussed. A proportion of patients had delayed obtaining medical care for financial reasons. This was associated with more severe problems and poorer outcome. A psycho-social approach to problems was rare and patient counseling did not appear to contribute to a sense of empowerment. Practitioners reported highest rapport with simpler consultations and rapport was negatively related to empowerment. The significance of these findings is discussed. In a final section it is suggested that medical treatment and counseling may be antithetical skills and that both practitioner and patient may have vested interests in a materialistic view of the content of their interaction. The forms of social control implicit in the encounter are elaborated.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2334</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changes in organisational design in New Zealand privatised organisations</field><field name="creator">Erakovi&#263;, Ljiljana</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted at the request of the author</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2335</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contemporary Developments in Catholic Missiology : the Story of the Sisters of Our Lady of the Missions of the Province of Aotearoa New Zealand, 1861-2000</field><field name="creator">Smith, Susan Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted at the request of the author</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::440000 Philosophy and Religion::440200 Religion and Religious Traditions::440204 Christian theology (incl.

Electrophoresis of the AMPs extracted from a selection of Demospongiae showed that most of the AMPs typical of vertebrate connective tissues were present. No evidence was found in this study to suggest a possible role whereby the presence or absence of sulphated AMPs could be of use in sponge taxonomy. Histochemical studies on the cytological localization of AMPs in both adult tissues and developing larvae also failed to provide any evidence to support the previous hypothesis that AMP localization could be used as an aid in the classification of the Demospongiae. Ultrastructural studies on the localization of AMPs indicated several mechanisms whereby AMPs could contribute to sponge cohesion. The AMPs associated with collagen fibrils were found to be arranged in a way essentially similar to that already described for mammals, and various other lines of evidence confirm the similarity of the sponge mesohyl to vertebrate connective tissue. There is, however, no need to imply a direct evolutionary relationship. The possible role of AMPs in both cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion has been examined in detail. Evidence is presented for the existence of an aggregation factor in Microciona coccinea. The factor has been shown to be a proteoglycan in a closely related species of sponge, and although conclusive evidence on the role of factor is lacking it is interpreted by many workers to be a surface attached molecule involved in adhesion. No evidence was obtained in this study to confirm localization of the factor at the sponge cell surface, but this may be a result of limitations in present ultrastructural techniques. Initial cell contact in cell-cell adhesion during aggregation was seen to occur in the regions of narrow extensions of the plasmalemmae termed membrane bridges. Structures of this sort have been proposed on physical grounds as one means by which cells may overcome the electric repulsive barrier between them to make adhesion by ionic bridging. Adhesion to the substrate in metamorphosing sponge larvae was seen to be mediated by a groundmat which is believed to be secreted by the larva, and which contains a granular component as well as collagen and fine filaments. The role of junctions in cell-cell adhesion was examined in detail in adult sponges and in aggregated cells. The presence of the cell junctions characteristic of other organisms could not be convincingly demonstrated in sponge tissues, and it seems probable that structures other than the typical cell junctions may be involved in communication and adhesion within sponges. An unusual AMP surface coat &#8211; the larval coat &#8211; is described from the surface of the T-pinacocytes in metamorphosing larvae of Halichondria moorei. The similarity of this coat in some respects to the fuzzy surface coat of amoebae is noted, and some of its possible functions are discussed.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2337</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Glucose Transporters in Diabetic Complications of the Lens</field><field name="creator">Merriman-Smith, B. Rachelle</field><field name="description">Lens transparency is primarily maintained by the anaerobic metabolism of glucose. Glucose is transported from the aqueous humuor to the lens epithelial cells however, it has not yet been established how glucose penetrates to the inner part of the lens. The core of the lens is acidic, approximately pH 6.5, as an effect of the accumulation of lactate, the end-product of glycolysis. This confirms that glucose is drawn deep into the core of the lens. Until recently it was assumed that glucose was transported to the core via a gap junction-mediated route by cell-cell diffusion. However, passive diffusion is limited in capacity and is unlikely to be sufficient for nutrient transport especially for larger lenses. Instead, an active circulation system has been proposed that has the potential to transport glucose deep into the lens via an extracellular route. This would imply that fibre cells may have evolved their own glucose uptake system, yet no direct evidence to this effect has been available. My thesis describes new molecular evidence that both epithelial and fibre cells have evolved their own glucose uptake system. The rat lens expresses the facilitative glucose transporters GLUTI and GLUT3 differentially. GLUTI is predominantly expressed in the epithelium while GLUT3 is predominantly expressed in the fibre cells of the lens. In the normal lens, this makes good physiological sense. GLUTI has a high Km suitable for situations of high glucose concentrations, as is the case for the epithelium where the aqueous humour mirrors glucose concentrations found in blood. GLUT3 has a lower Km and is particularly suitable for the fibre cells, where the supply of glucose from the tortuous extracellular space is limited. The discovery of GLUT3 in the fibre cells lends strong support for the existence of an active circulation system in the lens and makes it seem unlikely that glucose is transported into the core via gap junction-mediated diffusion. In the diabetic state, sorbitol - a product of glucose metabolism, occurs at elevated levels of about 30 times more than that of the normal, suggesting a significant increase in glucose uptake. This imposes an osmotic stress on the lens, which can be countered by regulated cell volume decrease only in the outer but not in the inner cortex. As a consequence inner cortex tissue breaks down and opacities result. My studies of the diabetic rat lens shows that the situation is made worse by an apparent up-regulation of GLUT3 in the fibre cells. Quantitative RT-PCR shows that the GLUT3 transcript is up-regulated six-fold during the initial weeks of diabetic insult in the streptozotocin rat model. The up-regulated GLUT3 protein is detected in the region where maximum tissue damage occurs. These results suggest a new mechanism for the initial tissue damage in the diabetic lens, whereby increased uptake of glucose leads to an over-production of sorbitol which causes osmotic stress on the fibre cells that is beyond their defense capability of regulated cell volume decrease. While my results described above have revolutionized our view of nutrient transport in the lens and its potential role in the early stages of diabetic cataract, the picture is only complete when the functionality of GLUT3 can be demonstrated. For this purpose, vesicles were prepared from isolated lens fibre cells and subjected to quantitative uptake studies using a fluorescent glucose derivative. Uptake was greatly reduced using the GLUT-specific inhibitor phloretin demonstrating that GLUT3 of the rat lens fibre cells is indeed fully functional. In summary, my results add a new dimension to our understanding of how the lens maintains homeostasis and tissue transparency.

In Chapter 3 a number of sweeteners, and representatives of all the taste groups are investigated using NMR spectroscopy. The T1 relaxation times of the tastants were determined in aqueous solution and in solution with liposomes, a model membrane system. The observed changes in T1, values are analysed to determine which regions of the tastants are involved in the interaction with the membrane. In Chapters 4 and 5 an investigation is reported of the interaction of tastants with a liquid membrane system, which is reportedly able to distinguish between classes of chemicals. The interest lies in developing a simple experiment that will enable taste qualities to be predicted, something that is currently not possible. In Chapters 6 and 7 the NMR assignments of some sweeteners is discussed. NMR assignments are a necessary precursor before their sweetening properties can be studied by NMR.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2339</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Professional Expertise: A Model for Integration and Change</field><field name="creator">Yielder, Jill</field><field name="description">The nature of professional expertise has been widely debated in the literature. However it has been examined primarily from a dichotomy of perspectives - either from an experiential or a cognitive focus, without the attempt to integrate these, and other aspects of expertise, into an integrated and coherent model. This research is structured in two sections. The first part incorporates a philosophical discussion, which advances an integrated model of professional expertise. The second part uses a case study focused on the field of medical imaging to illustrate and refine the model. Ten professionals identified as experts in the various sub-specialties within medical imaging were guided through a sustained period of interviews and logging of critical incidents in order to elicit in-depth data in relation to the process of expertise. Findings showed that while expertise is situated in the context of practice, it incorporates several dimensions working together in an integrated, seamless fashion through the medium of the individual practitioner. The proposed model integrates five main aspects, namely: knowledge base; cognitive processes; internal integrative processes; interpersonal relationships; and professional practice. That is, it is a synthesis of a particular knowledge base, the cognitive processes, personality and internal processes of the practitioner. It manifests through, and builds on, interpersonal relationships with clients and other professionals, and is expressed through the actual doing of professional practice. It is through the reflexive examination of practice and management of change that professionals may transform these five integrated aspects into the qualitative state of expertise. One of the implications of these findings for higher education are that institutions providing professional education need to value all the dimensions of expertise and their effective integration in order to promote the learning required to advance professionals towards this level of practice.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2340</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The hydrolysis of amides and ureas in acid solutions</field><field name="creator">Giffney, Carolyn Janet</field><field name="description">Despite the vast amount of research reported on the acid-catalysed hydrolysis of amides, the mechanism of reaction has remained a source of controversy. The various literature results have been summarised in the introduction. Two series of amides have been studied in this investigation, one a series of N-substituted, 4-chlorobenzamides, the other a series of substituted acetanilides. Their basicity (or acid-dissociation) constants have been evaluated in sulphuric acid, and the rates of hydrolysis measured over a wide range of acid concentrations. Within each series, variation of the substituent causes the rate constant to vary in a way which is typical of a bimolecular reaction involving rate-determining nucleophilic attack of water on the protonated intermediate. By drawing a comparison between the two series of amides, (i.e. the difference in basicities and rates of hydrolysis) it becomes apparent that the 0-protonated amide, which is thermodynamically favoured, is not the kinetically active species, A new rate equation is proposed, the equation being based on a mechanism in which water attacks the carbonyl carbon in the rate-determining step. The equation confidently predicts the experimental rate-profiles for the acid-hydrolysis of simple amides. It has been applied, in two forms, to the experimental rate data; the first form allows for the involvement of three water molecules in the slow step of hydrolysis, and the second form allows for the involvement of only two water molecules. The rate equation, in these two forms, has also been applied to much of the hydrolysis data reported in the literature and again it has proved to be very successful. In contrast to the amides, ureas have not been subjected to extensive research. In this investigation, the basicity constants of a series of substituted phenylureas have been measured, (if not already available) and the hydrolysis reactions carried out over a wide range of sulphuric acid concentrations, as well as in water. The 4-methyl and 4-chloro-phenylureas have also been hydrolysed in a range of hydrochloric and perchloric acid solutions; the effects of added salt were studied and the solvent isotope effects on the rate were evaluated. All these results, together with information obtained from application of the Hammett equation to the rate data, were in agreement with a mechanism involving a pre-equilibrium protonation to form the minor, N-protonated conjugate acid. This is followed by a slow transfer of the proton attached to the alternate nitrogen atom to form the appropriately substituted phenylisocyanate, and rapid reaction of this intermediate to form products. The substituent effects on the n.m.r. spectra of the substituted acetanilides and phenylureas have also been reported.</field><field name="date">1974</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2341</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CHESS: Chief Executive Stress Survival: a study of occupational stress in New Zealand top management</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Paul F.</field><field name="description">This study develops and used a CHESS (chief Executive Stress Survival) model developed from the occupational stress literature to predict variations in the psychological and physical stress experience and health risk of chief Executives of New Zealand organisations. The model proposes that stress is a sequential process with identifiable phases and that variation are mainly due to the frequency of environmental experiences and stressor factors which are both &#8220;chronic&#8221; and &#8220;episodic&#8221;, &#8220;at work&#8221; and &#8220;outside work&#8221;. The model also assumes, however, that the impact of the environmental variables and stressor factors are moderated by individual personality differences, coping mechanisms and stress management practices. The model was tested on a sample of 107 male chief Executive officers and General Managers. It was found that the majority of the sample (80%) were relatively stress resistant and healthy. Stepwise multiple regression was used to test the model, and some evidence derived suggests that the frequency of environmental problems does predict various stress symptoms and that environmental stressors ultimately predict health risk profiles. Individual differences are shown as being largely independent variables predicting stress, rather that being moderating variables as suggested by the model. Coping and stress management variables are also shown to play a significant moderating role in the stress - outcome relationship. Some evidence derived suggests that there may be individual manager profiles, provisionally labelled &#8220;stress immune&#8221; vs &#8220;vulnerable&#8221; and &#8220;ill - health preventers&#8221; vs &#8220;non-preventers&#8221;.

The extracts were incubated with radiolabelled tryptophan and other substrates and cofactors thought to be involved in indoleacetic acid biosynthesis. After incubation indolepyruvate and indoleacetic acid were separated and quantified by HPLC. There was no significant difference in the conversion of tryptophan to indolepyruvate and indoleacetic acid between the incubations and control incubations using boiled extract. The concentrations of indolepyruvate and indoleacetic acid in mung bean hypocotyl suspension cultures were measured using GC-MS SIM over the growth of the culture, a period of 29 days. Indoleacetic acid concentrations, although scattered, mostly remained at constant low levels in the range of 6 to 9ng/g fwt of culture. The indolepyruvate levels steadily increased to a maximum level after 14 days, then remained at this level, 10 to 12 ng/g fwt, for the remainder of the culture period. This plateau in indolepyruvate concentration matched the period that the suspension culture was in the logarithmic phase of growth. An aromatic amino acid aminotransferase was purified over 33,000 fold from the shoots and primary leaves of mung beans, as determined using a tryptophan aminotransferase activity assay. The enzyme was a monomer, with a molecular weight of about 58kDa. The pH optimum was broad, with a maximum at about 8.6. The relative activities of the aromatic amino acids were: tryptophan 100, tyrosine 83 and phenylalanine 75, and the Kms were 0.095, 0.08 and 0.07mM respectively. The enzyme was able to use 2-oxoglutarate, oxaloacetate and pyruvate as the oxo acid substrate at relative activities 100, 128 and 116 and Kms 0.65, 0.25 and 0.24mM respectively In addition to the aromatic amino acids the enzyme was able to transaminate alanine, arginine, leucine and lysine to a lesser extent, and showed slight activity with asparagine, aspartate, histidine, valine and D-tryptophan and tyrosine. Inhibition studies showed that the alanine, aspartate and histidine activities were part of the aromatic amino acid aminotransferase activity. The enzyme was not inhibited by indoleacetic acid, although naphthaleneacetic acid did inhibit slightly. There was evidence of substrate inhibition by hydroxyphenylpyruvate at high concentrations. Addition of the cofactor pyridoxal phosphate only slightly increased the activity of the enzyme. The enzyme was blotted onto a PVDF membrane cleaved by in situ trypsin digest. Three of the tryptic fragments were sequenced. These fragments had approximately 60% sequence similarity with plant aspartate aminotransferases and tyrosine aminotransferases.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing the Risks of Ageing: The Role of Private Pensions and Annuities within a Comprehensive Retirement Policy for New Zealand</field><field name="creator">St. John, Susan, 1945-</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340209 Public sector economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2345</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Worlds in Collision: The Gay Debate in New Zealand 1960-86</field><field name="creator">Guy, Laurie</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the public debate on homosexuality in New Zealand in the period 1960-86. Its focus is primarily on male homosexuality because the central issue was the continued criminalization of male same-sex sexual acts. The thesis notes irresolvable problems of definition of homosexuality involving discussions of behaviour, orientation and identity. Nevertheless, the debate proceeded on a binary basis, that homosexuals and heterosexuals were two clearly defined groups of people. The thesis begins by noting the repression and invisibility of homosexuals in the 1960s. It then explores the origins and significance of the New Zealand Homosexual Law Reform Society and the gay liberation movement. Because of the significance of religion in regard to the debate, a chapter is devoted to major change and cleavage that occurred within the churches relating to homosexuality in the period reviewed. Finally the intense fifteen months of debate that occurred prior to decriminalization of male homosexual activity in July 1986 is studied at depth. The thesis highlights the intensity of feeling that the debate engendered. This was the result of the clash of fundamentally different worldviews and value systems. Behind the particular issue lay the question of the moral and social status of homosexuals and homosexual acts. So fundamental was this division that from both sides the very future of society seemed to be at stake. Worlds were in collision.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2346</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Citizenship Under Neo-Liberalism: Immigrant Minorities in New Zealand 1990-1999</field><field name="creator">McMillan, Katherine Alexandra</field><field name="description">Ideally, a citizen is an individual who is a formal member of a self-governing political community, with individual rights and freedoms that are equal to those of other citizens, and which are protected by law. This thesis investigates how closely the citizenship status of non-Maori ethnic minorities in New Zealand approximated this ideal during the 1990s. Its particular focus is on how the neo-liberal ideology of National and Coalition Governments between 1990 and 1999, and those Governments' understandings of the nature and political significance of ethnicity, affected the ability of those belonging to non-Maori ethnic minority groups to be full and equal members of the New Zealand political community, with an equal capacity for self-governance at the individual level and as members of the political community. The thesis takes the form of a survey of public policy and law over a period of nine years. Five broad areas or aspects of public policy are examined: the collection and dissemination of official 'ethnic' statistics; immigration and citizenship policy; civil rights provided for in domestic and international law; mechanisms for ensuring access to political decision-making; and social policy. The question asked in the thesis is whether the policies developed and administered in each of these areas during the 1990s enriched or detracted from the citizenship status of non-Maori ethnic minorities.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2347</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of Triton X Series Nonionic Surfactant Solutions</field><field name="creator">Qiao, Lijun</field><field name="description">This work contains some fundamental investigations on Triton X series nonionic surfactants from different aspects. Techniques, such as viscometry, densimetry, diffusion measurement, ultra-violet spectrophotometry, differential scanning calorimetry, surface tension measurement and optical microscopy were employed to acquire the information. Some theoretical analyses were given to the results of these measurements. Triton X surfactants show different properties when they dissolve in different solvents. Aggregation can occur in some solvents, depending on the interactions between solvent and solute. The addition of a surfactant to a solvent will give rise to a solute-solvent interaction and change the solute-solute and solvent-solvent interactions as well. From mass transport properties of the surfactant solutions, these interactions were studied and the contributions to them from each species of the solutions were calculated with a transition-state theory model which is usually used for small molecule systems. Under some reasonable assumptions, a new theoretical method was set up and was able to give a reasonable explanation for the experimental results. The surfactants can also associate with some dyes in both polar and apolar media. The ultra-violet spectra of the surfactant-dye solutions show that surfactant-dye complexes might be formed in the polar and apolar media where the surfactants form regular and reversed micelles respectively. The mechanism of the complexation reactions was studied with equilibrium theory and the charge-transfer nature of the association between the surfactant and dye revealed. The surface tension and. cloud point changes due to the addition of polyethylene glycol were determined to discover the interaction between the water-soluble polymer PEG and the surfactants at the air-solution interface and in the bulk solutions respectively. The mass distribution of the two materials between the two phases produced in the segregation (at the cloud point) of the solutions were determined by their ultra-violet adsorption spectra and densities. The analysis of the cloud point changes was given with the new concepts of polysoap and depletion flocculation. The results show that the size of the micelles, the length of the polymer chains, and the structures of the intra - chain micelles can change the mechanisms of polymer-surfactant interaction and influence the properties of the polymer/surfactant solutions. In a certain range of concentrations, the surfactants aqueous solutions can form liquid crystalline structures which can be observed under a cross-polarised microscope and determined by differential scanning calorimetry. The phase diagrams and their variations with additions of the third component, such as xylene, polyethylene glycol and BaCl2 2H2O have been determined. The effects of temperature and each of the additives on the ordered structures were analysed separately in the light of concepts of spontaneous mean curvature and "salting out" effect. Osmotic coefficients of the surfactant aqueous and methanol solutions were determined with a vapour pressure osmometer, and the activity coefficient of the solvent can be calculated with the osmotic coefficients. The change of the activity coefficient with increase of surfactant concentration shows the interactions of the surfactant with the solvent. In aqueous solution, the addition of surfactant frees the solvent molecules, leading to an activity coefficient larger than 1. In methanol solution, the surfactant addition reduces the fugacity of methanol molecules, resulting in an activity coefficient less than 1. Chemical shift changes of protons of the surfactant molecules in the lH NMR spectra show some information about the configuration of the chains, hydration, and phase structure of the solution system when the surfactant concentration changes over the whole concentration range. From 40% w/w the associated water molecules begin to be lost, and the association number ratio of water molecules and the ethylene oxide unit of the surfactant is 4:1. Electric conductance of electrolytes in the surfactant aqueous solutions are reduced by the addition of the surfactants. The reduction is more significant for large size cations, and the longer the EO chain of the surfactant, the larger the reducing effect on conductance.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2349</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#65279;First language attrition in a second language learning environment: the case of Korean-English late bilinguals</field><field name="creator">Kim, Sun Hee</field><field name="description">This thesis explores L1 attrition among young Korean-English late bilinguals. Thirty Korean immigrants to New Zealand, who had arrived at the age of 12-13 years and had spent at least 2 years in New Zealand, participated in the study. Ten monolingual Korean children aged 12 years served as a comparison group for L1 data. Linguistic data in both L1 and L2 were elicited by a standardised picture-naming test and a story-retelling task supplemented by a stimulated recall protocol. Information related to social variables and language use patterns was elicited through a questionnaire and interviews. Skehan (1996; 1998; 2001) proposes three dimensions of linguistic performance&#8212; accuracy, fluency, and complexity. The general findings suggest that accuracy and lexical diversity in L1 are most susceptible to attrition and that there is general positive transfer from L1 to L2 skills. While there is no direct negative interaction between L1 and L2 proficiency, analysis reveals that increasing L2 fluency and a decrease in L1 use have possible indirect effects on attrition in L1 accuracy but not in L1 lexical diversity. The data suggest that, while the frequency of return visits to the homeland is an important social variable, language use involving the father and siblings is also an important factor in attrition or maintenance of L1 proficiency of adolescent late bilinguals. Qualitative analysis conducted on five cases corroborates the quantitative findings. Analyses of speech samples reveal that synthetic structures with semantic ambiguity are most susceptible to L1 attrition. The qualitative analysis also highlights the role of L2 socialisation in L1 attrition in adolescent immigrant children who negotiate their language use and identities in an L2-dominant environment and show different patterns of attrition in their L1.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420119 Korean</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2366</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of giant Kerr nonlinearity</field><field name="creator">Rebic, Stojan</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the properties of an atomic system exhibiting a giant Kerr nonlinearity. The atomic energy level scheme involves four energy levels. A three level A subsystem in the atom exhibits the effect of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), reducing the spontaneous emission noise. The fourth level leads to an ac-Stark shift of the ground state, which in turn leads to a giant, noiseless Kerr nonlinearity. Two different environments are explored. First, a system comprising of large number of atoms in an optical cavity is analysed. Detailed aspects of noise reduction in this system are investigated. In particular, strong squeezing in the quadrature in phase with the field driving the cavity mode is found, if the effective coupling of light to the atoms is strong. However, the linewidth of the predicted squeezing is found to be very narrow. This is attributed to a very steep linear susceptibility of the atomic medium. Since the widening of the squeezing window is possible only for weaker effective coupling, in turn reducing the squeezing level, a different environment is proposed. This involves a single four level atom, strongly coupled to the cavity mode. In such a strongly coupled system, the most appropriate approach is found to be that formulated in terms of polaritons &#8211; composite excitations of the 'atom-cavity molecule'. Adopting the polariton approach, nonclassical correlations in the field leaving the cavity are investigated. Strong photon antibunching is found and the effect of photon blockade predicted and described. The photon blockade effect can also be found in a system comprised of a two level atom coupled to the cavity mode, if the external driving is tuned to one of the vacuum Rabi resonances. A comparison between the two schemes is performed, and it is found that the four level scheme exhibits much better photon blockade. The reason for this is quantum interference between secondary transitions in the dressed states picture. Destructive interference cancels the transitions that would otherwise introduce a second photon into the system, hence producing a more robust photon blockade. All of these results are valid in the regime where external driving is weak. If the external driving strength is increased, the photon statistics (as measured by the zero-delay second order correlation function) changes from strong antibunching to strong bunching, over a relatively narrow range of driving strengths. The occurrence of this change can again be attributed to quantum interference. It is shown that the interference effect prevents the excitation of the composite system by a second photon, but not excitation by a two-photon transition (following the first excitation). Therefore, the third excitation manifold is excited, which then decays back to the first manifold in a two photon cascade. This two photon cascade is the source of correlated photon pairs causing an increase in the second order correlation function. The dynamics of forward scattering of light is presented, and nonclassical behaviour of the delay dependence of correlation function ('overshoots' and 'undershoots') is discussed. For the analytical treatment of this system, a method based on the polariton approach is devised, which includes the treatment of driving and damping. It is shown that this method is ideally suited to the analysis of strongly coupled systems, where only a few photons contribute to the dynamics.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240300 Atomic and Molecular Physics; Nuclear and Particle Physics, Plasma Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2350</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental and applied behaviour analysis</field><field name="creator">Wardlaw, Grant Ronald</field><field name="description">It is often claimed that applied behaviour analysis is founded on basic behavioural concepts involving the direct extrapolation of data from the experimental laboratory to the analysis of human behaviour. It is claimed that such an approach gives theoretical coherence to a set of procedures, and avoids the pitfalls associated with a collection of unrelated techniques. This presumed experimental base is said to make applied behaviour analysis more rigorous, more effective, more systematic, and easier to teach and learn than other approaches to the modification of human behaviour. There is reason to believe, however, that the link between experimental and applied behaviour analysis is more one of commitment than reality. Previous authors have shown that research findings from the experimental analysis of behaviour are becoming increasingly isolated from other areas of psychology in general. The present study provides evidence that such findings are also isolated from applied behaviour analysis in particular. Experimental data are seldom cited in applied work and, when they are, it is seldom specific or current data to which references are made. It is argued that this state of affairs is attributable to the acceptance, by applied behaviour analysis, of a model of behaviour whose complexity is insufficient to cope with the complex interactive nature of human behaviour. The present work provides an outline of the current applied behaviour analytic model, and then proceeds to discuss some of the major types of data of which the model takes no significant account. An extensive examination of data from the experimental analysis of choice behaviour is given, which reveals the level of complexity to which application may be made. Suggestions as to the practical utilization of these data are made, with particular reference to the areas of self-control and commitment. A case study involving the use of a commitment procedure in the treatment of an exhibitionist and another concerning the application of experimentally-derived procedures to a self-control problem, provide clinical evidence of the usefulness of the direct incorporation of experimental data. Following these applied case studies, a number of other areas of experimental research are examined with respect to their relevance to applied behaviour analysis. Significant data from the study of multiple-schedule interactions, stimulus control, and two specific types of analyses of reinforcement phenomena are outlined and suggestions made concerning their applied potential. Further, data which could determine the limits of the applicability of experimental data, in the context of biological constraints on behaviour, are shown to be capable of further increasing the utility of applied behaviour analytic techniques. Finally, the implications of the data analyzed are discussed in terms of the future training of applied behaviour analysts.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2352</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inhibitory dimensional and inhibitory stimulus control in pigeons with forebrain lesions</field><field name="creator">Wild, John Martin</field><field name="description">Lesions were placed in several areas of the telencephalon and diencephalon of the brain of the pigeon and the effects on the acquisition of inhibitory dimensional and inhibitory stimulus control were observed. The experimental tasks consisted of both visual and auditory interdimensional discriminations each of which had two components: In the first the stimuli were presented successively on the one response key (the main key) according to a multiple variable-interval extinction schedule. In the second the multiple schedule still obtained but a changeover key was added which, when pecked, changed the main-key stimulus, together with its associated schedule of reinforcement, to the next in a randomly ordered series. The use of these two components allowed the separation of two aspects of inhibitory control in learning: response reduction and stimulus reduction thereby permitting the assessment of discriminative ability in the absence of the confounding factor of response reduction. Inhibitory dimensional and inhibitory stimulus control were assessed by post-discrimination generalization tests and combined-cue tests, respectively. It was found that lesions to areas considered limbic - hippocampus, septum, anterior dorsomedial thalamus - had no effect on the learning of a visual discrimination. Lesions to the dorsolateral thalamus produced a complete inability to learn this discrimination, presumably due to disruption of visual fibres en route to the telecephalon. Lesions to the Wulst produced a visual discrimination learning deficit in some birds but not in others, an inconsistency not accounted for by differences in lesion size. Wulst lesions also produced an auditory discrimination learning deficit and in this case the larger the lesion, the larger the deficit. Lesions to ectostriatum produced a deficit in the visual task and lesions to Field L, an auditory projection area, produced a deficit in the auditory task, but not in the visual task. However, in most cases the discrimination learning deficit which was produced was confined to the multiple schedule where the animal had no control over the presentation or duration of the stimuli. Once the changeover key was introduced most birds obtained the learning criterion very quickly by "switching out" of the negative stimulus. This effective changeover responding, together with unimpaired inhibitory dimensional or inhibitory stimulus control, suggested that although the initial learning deficit might be described in terms of an inability to withhold responding in the presence of stimuli previously correlated with reinforcement, this inability could not readily be explained in terms of a lesion-induced impairment in an inhibitory process.</field><field name="date">1974</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2353</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of biologically active natural products - Texaline, Pseudopyronines A and B, and Varacin</field><field name="creator">Giddens, Anna Claire</field><field name="description">SAR studies on two classes of natural products, namely the terrestrial natural product texaline (2.1) and the marine derived natural products pseudopyronines A (3.64) and B (3.65) are described, as are chemical genetics studies using the cytotoxic marine natural product varacin (4.30a). The biological activities of these natural products and synthetic analogues were assessed in a variety of assays. A general methodology was developed that led to the first reported synthesis of texaline. Screening of texaline and related compounds found the oxazole natural product to be inactive against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, while oxazole 2,5- diphenyloxazole (2.86) was found to possess modest antitubercular activity. In order to develop oxazoles with enhanced biological activity, analogues of 2,5- diphenyloxazole were synthesized and tested against M. tuberculosis. All structural modifications to the 2,5-diphenyloxazole scaffold resulted in diminished activity. Consequently, 2,5-diphenyloxazole remains the most active of the oxazoles prepared to date. Pseudopyronines A and B were synthesized for the first time, via CDImediated condensation of alkyl  -keto carboxylic acids. The natural products and related compounds were tested in a range of biological assays. Pyrones 3.64, 3.65 and 3.107 possessed the most potent antitubercular activity. Pseudopyronines A and B and analogues were also assessed for activity against several tropical diseases. None of the compounds exhibited significant activity against Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma cruzi or T. brucei rhodesiense. However pyrones 3.107 and 3.105 exhibited significant in vitro activity against Leishmania donovani. Varacin (4.30b), isolated from the New Zealand ascidian Lissoclinum notti, was tested in a zebrafish embryo assay along with its N-Boc protected derivative 4.30d and analogue DMPE (4.69). Dosing zebrafish embryos with varacin and Bocvaracin at increasing concentrations afforded phenotypic changes in the embryos. Boc-varacin proved more potent than varacin in the assay, while DMPE was inactive making it a suitable negative control. Varacin and DMPE were attached to Sepharose 4B and the resulting matrices utilized in affinity chromatography experiments with the aim of uncovering varacin protein target(s). To visualize the distribution of varacin within the zebrafish embryo, attachment of fluorescent labels to DMPE and varacin was investigated.

Like other cereal crops, barley suffers from a narrowing of its genetic base and susceptibility to diseases, pests and environmental stresses. H. bulbosum is a possible source of desirable genes for introgressing into barley to restore genetic diversity and improve current cultivars. Sexual hybridisation between barley and H. bulbosum is the main method for interspecific gene transfer in barley breeding but there are several barriers to overcome. Two of these are reduced recombination and the ability to identify recombinants quickly and efficiently. The aim in this thesis was to gain a better understanding of meiotic chromosomal behaviour in the two species and their hybrids and to improve the characterisation of recombinants from the hybrids. To study the events during meiosis, synaptonemal complex (SC) analysis was carried out on the two species and two H. vulgare - H. bulbosum hybrids. The results indicated that there were interspecific and intraspecific variations in SC length. Mean SC length was positively correlated with recombination frequency but not related to genome size. This suggests that the ratios of mean SC length to genome size (SC/DNA) show divergence among these Hordeum examples. An hypothesis based on the conformation of chromatin associated with axial element, which is dependent on SC/DNA ratio, was presented to explain the relationship between SC length and recombination frequency. Chromosome pairing in the two hybrids was determined by observation at pachytene and metaphase I (MI). Mean percentages of synapses were similar but there were different frequencies of MI pairing between these two hybrids, indicating that different mechanisms may regulate synapsis and MI pairing in the hybrids. To investigate meiotic recombination, genomic in situ hybridisation (GISH) was performed on the two hybrids at MI and anaphase I (AI). It was observed that intergenomic pairing and recombination events occur in distal chromosome segments. A great discrepancy between mean pairing and recombination frequencies was observed in both hybrids and several possible reasons for this discrepancy were discussed. Hybrid 102C2 with high MI pairing had a significantly higher recombination frequency than the low pairing 103K5, suggesting that high MI pairing appears to be associated with high recombination in the hybrids. An interesting finding is that the ratio of recombination to MI pairing in 103K5 (l:8.9) is twice as high compared with 102C2 (l:17). However, the mechanism for this difference in the ratio between the two hybrids remains unknown. Sequential fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and GISH were used successfully to localise the introgressions in selfed progeny from a tetraploid hybrid derived from chromosome-doubled 102C2 (102C2/colch). This procedure is fast, cheap and can efficiently detect and locate introgressions. Several disease-resistant recombinants were analysed in more details and leaf rust and powdery mildew resistance was associated with distal introgressions on chromosomes 2HS and 2HL (leaf rust) and 2HS (powdery mildew). It is possible that the leaf rust and powdery mildew resistances were closely linked in the distal region of 2HS. A considerable variation in introgression size was observed at similar chromosomal sites among the different recombinants, which will provide useful information for map-based cloning of genes.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics::270209 Meiosis and recombination</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2355</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Diaries of Genevi&#232;ve Br&#233;ton 1874-1914</field><field name="creator">Burnet, Catherine Margaret</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2370</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Class and occupational mobility among farm employees</field><field name="creator">Loveridge, Alison, 1955-</field><field name="description">Class mobility in farming works both ways, some farmer's children are unable to afford a farm, while others from non-farm families do succeed in farm ownership. The literature reviewed in this thesis suggests this situation is related to New Zealand's economic history. In the past small family farms have benefited from both secure markets and governments whose interests have been closely bound up with high productivity. This has led the state to offer cheap credit to prospective farmers with little cap1al of their own. Upward mobility has been possible, but at the same time state support has enabled relatively small farms to remain viable, and many of these are unable to secure farm ownership for all family members. In this thesis I explore class mobility and career patterns among farm employees and consider their wider implications. There are many ambiguities in farm employment in New Zealand which stem from the predominance of petty bourgeois farm owners. Such farmers must deal with the capitalist markets of other sectors when they purchase inputs or sell their product but family workers may act as a bulwark against commercial pressures by accepting lower incomes. Similar conditions may be forced on working class farm employees with no chance of ownership. The high number of people leaving farm employment offers indirect confirmation of such problems and this thesis investigates the context in which departures occurred. Farm employees consist of three groups, those without interest in farm ownership, those with an interest and little chance of success, and those whose family background ensures farm ownership. Many farms only have one employee and take on non-family labour for short periods when the family labour which would otherwise do the task is unavailable. Some of the people they employ are offspring of neighbouring farm owners. This variation in class interests has exacerbated the disinclination of farm employees to lake collective action in the face of poor wages and conditions. By tracing a sample of farm employees through the electoral rolls over a period of ten years, I have been able to contact three groups of farm employees: those who have left for non-farm work in the intervening period; those who have been farm workers for at least ten years; and those who have since become farm owners. This has given me an insight into the proportion of farm employees who take up farming hoping to own their own farm, and the problems involved in succeeding. People who have left farming also provide an important perspective on farm employment. I have correlated outcome of career by various background factors, principally father's occupation, aspiration, and education. Job history is also important to my analysis. All these factors influence class mobility, and may either increase or mask the action of each other in different circumstances. By looking at mobility I will demonstrate the way class relationships impinge on individual lives.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2358</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Migration and settlement in Indian, Korean and Chinese immigrant communities in Auckland: a perspective from the political ecology of health</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Anneka</field><field name="description">This research used tuberculosis (TB) as a lens to elucidate how migration, settlement, local agency and support networks influence migrants&#8217; health in New Zealand. The study also examined specific characteristics of TB such as delays in diagnosis and the stigma attached to the disease to gain a broader understanding of TB experience for migrants in New Zealand. The research addressed these aims through the analytical framework of political ecology and incorporation of interviews, participant observation and media analysis. Participants in the research included immigrants from Mainland China, South Korea, and India, and New Zealand health care professionals. The study found that immigration policies, social discrimination and isolation have created structural inequalities between dominant host populations and Asian migrants in New Zealand. These inequalities compounded settlement problems such as language difficulties and limited employment opportunities, resulting in low income levels and perceived stress for Indian, Korean and Chinese people, which has affected their health and well being. Transnational policies and experiences of health care systems in immigrants&#8217; countries of origin and in New Zealand strongly influenced health seeking behaviour of migrants, along with structural barriers such as lack of Asian health care professionals and interpreting services. Local cultural and biological factors including health cultures and physical symptoms also affected these practices. In relation to TB, structural processes along with clinic doctor-patient relationships and social stigmas created barriers to diagnosis and treatment. Factors that facilitated access to health care in general, and TB diagnosis and treatment in particular, included the use of support networks, particularly local General Practitioners from countries of origin, and Public Health Nurses, along with flexible TB treatment programmes. This study shows that the incidence and experience of TB is shaped by migration and settlement processes. It also builds upon other medical anthropological studies that have employed political ecology by demonstrating its usefulness in application to developed as well as developing countries. In addition, the study contributes to the growing area of Asian migration research in New Zealand, illustrating that migration and settlement processes are complex and need to be understood as multidimensional, thus demonstrating advantages in approaching them from a political ecological framework.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Immigration, Migrant Health, Political Ecology, Tuberculosis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2416</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Globalisation and the Return to Empire: an Indigenous Response = Te torino whakahaere, whakamuri</field><field name="creator">Stewart-Harawira, Makere</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420305 New Zealand cultural studies</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2360</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Demonstrative clefts in spoken English</field><field name="creator">Calude, Andreea S.</field><field name="description">This research concerns the structural and discourse related properties of cleft constructions found in spoken New Zealand English. In particular, the main analysis focuses on one cleft type, namely on the demonstrative cleft; examples include (a) 'That's what I had in mind' and (b) 'That's what I thought'. The demonstrative cleft has received little attention in the literature, and this is reflected in its inconsistent classification (some believe it to be a reversed wh-cleft, others classify it together with it-clefts, and others still use the label &#8216;th-cleft&#8217;).  The current work investigates the clefts exemplified in (a) and (b), in terms of 23 different structural and discourse related properties. These properties were identified by consulting existing literature on clefts, and data from the Wellington Corpus of Spoken New Zealand English (about 200,000 words of spontaneous conversation). Additionally, the same excerpts of conversation were also examined for it-clefts, wh-clefts and reversed wh-clefts, whose most significant properties in spoken language are also related here. The data were tagged manually for the various cleft constructions investigated, and difficult examples were cross-checked by and discussed with other linguists.  The thesis consists of three introductory chapters (Chapters 1, 2 and 3), which introduce the data investigated and the constructions analysed. Chapter 4 presents the analysis of the demonstrative cleft. Following this, peripheral and problematic demonstrative clefts, that is, clefts which deviate from the prototypical demonstrative cleft model are discussed in Chapter 5. Finally, Chapter 6 deals with other cleft types in English, namely it-clefts, wh-clefts and reversed wh-clefts, and their most significant properties in spoken language. The thesis concludes with a summary chapter (Chapter 7).  One innovative aspect of the research concerns the fact that in spoken language, clefts can be 'un-integrated' or loosely integrated inside the syntactic structure which they are part of, while still being tightly connected within the discourse portion in which they are found, e.g., 'That's what you have to do when moving into a new house is nest', and 'That is what the government wants you to do is to vote Labour' (termed here double cleft construction). Double clefts are discussed in Chapter 4. The corpus also contains un-integrated wh-clefts, such as 'What I want to do is I want to study clefts', treated in Chapter 5. Previous studies suggest that in spoken language, the distinction between the syntax of clauses and the overall organisation of discourse is not always clear; clauses which do not appear to be syntactically subordinate may nonetheless be subordinate in terms of the discourse role they play. This is problematic for existing syntactic theories which rely on tightly integrated structures. An adequate analysis of un-integrated constructions, in terms of their syntax and discourse function will be of interest both to theoretical syntax and to computational linguistics.  The research contributes to existing knowledge of the grammatical constructions used by speakers of New Zealand English and English worldwide. Given the significant differences between the grammar of spoken language and that of written language, this work helps increase understanding of spoken language and of what it means to be a &#8216;speaker&#8217;.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spoken grammar</field><field name="subject">clefts</field><field name="subject">cognitive gramar</field><field name="subject">syntactic un-integration</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2415</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanistic Studies of HF Adsorption on Alumina</field><field name="creator">Gillespie, Alistair Ross</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2361</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching and learning with technology as enabler: a case study on flexible learning for postgraduate nurses</field><field name="creator">Honey, Michelle Lorraine Lewis</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to explore the practice of flexible learning for postgraduate nurses.  Flexible learning is a contemporary approach to learning that utilises the benefits of technology.  Flexible learning can be understood as a continuum, from fully on-line or web-based courses, to those that are on-campus and supported by technology.  Internationally, the rise of flexible learning has been influenced by increased demand for higher education and competition among providers within the context of reduced education funding.  The study population, New Zealand postgraduate nurses are accessing higher education in increasing numbers to advance their practice and to position themselves for new roles and opportunities.  These are often experienced nurses yet inexperienced in higher university education, who combine study, work and other commitments.  The study employed a qualitative case study design because it enabled multiple perspectives to be gained.  Data included documentation, participant observation, survey, students&#8217; assessed work and interviews with key stakeholders: student, teacher and the organisation.  Data collection and analysis occurred simultaneously as an iterative process.  Thematic analysis was conducted on reviewed documentation, participant observation and interviews.  The survey was analysed using descriptive statistical analysis techniques.  Finally, a rubric was constructed as a matrix for analysing assessed work.  The study identifies the elements that contribute to flexible learning and the interconnectedness between the elements within the dynamic context of a university to illustrate that effective flexible learning can be provided by using a student centred approach to ensure the learning needs of postgraduate nurses are met.  Flexible learning was found to improve access, choice, and provide an emphasis on the student as central to learning.  In response to these findings the weighting of recommendations are toward the organisation as it is at this level where greater change can be made to improve support for flexible learning provision.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nursing education</field><field name="subject">flexible learning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2383</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Brands we love to hate: An exploration of brand avoidance</field><field name="creator">Lee, Michael Shyue Wai</field><field name="description">Brands, and the process of branding, are of considerable importance in both marketing academia and practice. Although most research has focussed on the positive attitudes and behaviours that consumers have toward brands, there is a growing interest in anti-consumption. This thesis contributes to anti-consumption research by exploring the phenomenon of brand avoidance. Earlier studies investigating the avoidance of brands have been one-dimensional, failing to account for the wide range of reasons underlying brand avoidance. Therefore, this thesis addresses the limitations of existing models by providing an integrative and comprehensive approach to understanding brand avoidance. As an anti-consumption phenomenon, brand avoidance concerns the negative interaction between consumers, as social actors, and brands, as meaningful objects, within a social and historical context. Therefore, this thesis adopts an interpretive approach, a social constructionist epistemology, and historical realist ontology. Since research in the immediate area of brand avoidance is limited, this thesis employs a grounded theory methodology to analyse, code, and generate theory from the qualitative data gathered through 23 in-depth interviews. Four main types of brand avoidance (experiential, identity, deficit-value, and moral) and the circumstances in which brand avoidance may be restricted or alleviated (avoidance antidotes) emerge from the data. Existing literatures are used to further inform these findings and an original negative brand promises framework is developed to help increase understanding of the brand avoidance phenomenon. The main components of this research are then integrated into an emergent theoretical model of brand avoidance. This model offers a synopsis of how the various brand avoidance constructs may relate to one another and to other pertinent branding concepts within a consumption system. Combined, the findings of this thesis provide a comprehensive appreciation of why consumers avoid certain brands in addition to potential insights that may be used in the management of brand avoidance. Overall, this thesis contributes knowledge to the growing field of anti-consumption research by providing an innovative overview and an integrative understanding of an under-explored domain, brand avoidance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brand avoidance</field><field name="subject">Anti-consumption</field><field name="subject">Grounded theory</field><field name="subject">Consumer resistance</field><field name="subject">Disatisfaction</field><field name="subject">Undesired self</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2556</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Uttar Pradesh - lagging state of India: economic development and role of banks</field><field name="creator">Arora, Rashmi Umesh</field><field name="description">The present study challenges the negative and static stance of the recent literature on Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state of India, and espouses a balanced and moderate approach. The existing literature focuses only on human development and ignores the underlying social, political and economic changes taking place in the state. It ignores the decline in credit to the state. The present study synthesises and amalgamates various streams of literature on the state to fill the gap. It uses bank credit and its role in UP&#8217;s economic development as a tool to explore the changes and structural and regional shifts in the state. It examines bank credit to various regions, districts, occupations, rural and urban populations, large and small borrowers and gender in UP. This study explores credit in a multi-dimensional framework as a route to growth, development, inequality, globalisation, urbanisation, and empowerment. The study further explores the relationship between bank credit and the state&#8217;s human development. As a critique of the existing literature, the study examines whether UP is really lagging behind other states of India. Through a twin indicator approach, broadly grouped into income and non-income, the study shows that the state does lag on income front. The non-income indicators analysis, however, shows that a number of other states including high-income states are lagging. The study eschews the watertight categorisation of east and west UP as pursued in the existing literature, and adopts a broader regional classification. This showed that, although gradual, change has occurred in UP. The overall findings of the study suggest that structural and non-structural constraints characterise the development of the state. The multiple roles of credit have generated growth, helped in poverty reduction, but also influenced regional inequality and rural-urban inequalities, and widened the gap between small and large borrowers in the state. The empowerment of women through credit from commercial banks remains a distant goal as women receive less than 20 per cent of the total credit. Another significant finding of the study is that the income and non-income factors are strongly correlated, for instance, the strong negative relationship between income and the Human Poverty Index. The study, therefore, underlines the need for increased economic growth to achieve better economic and human development outcomes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Uttar Pradesh, India, Development, Economic Growth, Bank credit, Poverty</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2386</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Feeding the frontiers: logistical limitations of Roman imperialism in the West</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Christopher Felstead</field><field name="description">This thesis is an examination of the importance of army supply in deciding the success and failure of the frontiers of the Roman Empire with particular emphasis on those frontiers in the Rhine-Danube provinces. It will look at logistics as the reason for the end of expansion of the Roman Empire and the frontiers forming where they did. It will also argue that the failure of logistics was a major factor in the collapse of those same frontier defences and the ultimate fall of the western part of the empire. The need to feed and supply large numbers of troops and their dependents dictated where they could be based. Because of the impossibility of supplying the whole army with imported goods, the suitability of local land for food production was also paramount. The need to have reliable sources of supply locally was met by placing veterans on retirement in villae rusticae in frontier zones. This had the effect of controlling those local sources of supply and also satisfying the increasingly expensive needs of the army praemia militiae. The increased warfare and periodic invasions from the reign of Marcus Aurelius especially on the upper Rhine and upper Danube made supply more difficult. The army placed an increasing number of beneficiarii consularis on important points on the transport network to control and direct the flow of army supplies. The more frequent invasions across the frontiers from the third century caused greater dislocation to the agricultural infrastructure not only on the frontiers but deeper into the more settled and richer provinces. This destroyed the sources of local supply and also often the source of imported supply, forcing Roman armies to stay well inside the imperial boundaries more often than before. The loss of their logistic superiority spelt the loss of their military advantage, and the loss of empire.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies::430112 History: Classical Greek and Roman</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2369</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the artwork-world: perichoretic rehearsals of the divine encounter</field><field name="creator">Jack, Matthew, 1963-</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted at the request of the author.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::440000 Philosophy and Religion::440100 Philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2374</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microbiological Indicators of Faecal Contamination in Aquatic Environments</field><field name="creator">Turner, Susan Jane</field><field name="description">1. The aim of this research was to determine appropriate microbial indicator systems for use in monitoring the occurrence and source of faecal contamination in aquatic environments. Particular emphasis has been placed on the identification of indicators which might enable faecal contamination of human origin to be distinguished from that of non-human derivation. Two lines of investigation have been pursued; the use of alternative microbial indicator systems for water quality monitoring, and the development of diagnostic molecular methods for identifying the origin of faecal organisms. 2. Field and treatment plant studies were undertaken to investigate the utility of three indicator systems for monitoring water quality impacts in the coastal area surrounding the discharge from Auckland's North Shore City wastewater treatment plant. F-specific bacteriophage (F-phage) and ratios of F-phage to enterococci and faecal coliforms were examined over a twelve month period in which indicator levels at various stages of the wastewater treatment process were measured. These indicators and levels of Clostridium perfringens spores in sediment were measured in four outfall impact studies. 3. F-phage levels in effluent from the treatment plant (median=2.5 x 102 cfu/l00 ml) were too low to enable their use as source-specific tracers of effluent dispersion. However, higher F-phage levels in raw sewage (median=6.2 x l05 cfu/l00 ml) suggested that phage may be an appropriate indicator of raw sewage contamination in the receiving environment. F-phage was detected in coastal waters remote from the sewage outfall, providing presumptive evidence of sewage contamination entering the sea from sources other than the outfall discharge itself. 4. F-phage/enterococci and F-phage/faecal coliform ratios that were determined for sewage and treated effluent derived from the North Shore plant proved to be highly variable and were therefore unreliable for determining the source faecal contamination. 5. The concentration of Clostridium perfringens spores in sediments did not provide a useful means for tracing the distribution of faecal contaminants in the coastal system because the spore levels were found to be similar throughout the study area. This widespread occurrence of C. perfringens spores prevented identification of defined impact zones for any of the potential sources of faecal contaminants examined. 6. Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis was used to investigate whether genetic markers could be identified for Escherichia coli isolates derived from different sources. RAPD profiling was found to be a highly discriminative method able to subtype E. coli strains present in both sewage and in the wastewater stream of a mechanical wood-pulping operation. In the pulp mill effluent, RAPD analysis indicated the presence of a restricted range of E. coli strains compared to the range found in the water intake and sewage effluent discharges. The results obtained provide presumptive evidence for the multiplication of E. coli strains within the wastewater stream. 7. Comparison of RAPD profiles derived from a range of human and environmental E. coli isolates led to the identification of a 1.6-kb marker. present in a subset of human isolates, but found only infrequently in isolates from animal origin. Primers based on sequence information obtained from this region of the genome yielded a direct PCR assay for the 'human' marker. The reliability and utility of the assay was improved when fluorescently-labelled primers and an automated DNA detection system was employed for the analysis of the amplified PCR products. 8. The diagnostic polymorphism was localised to the region immediately downstream of the gene encoding the glycine decarboxylase P-protein (gcvP). Comparison of DNA sequences from this region in 'marker-positive' and 'marker-negative' E. coli isolates revealed an abrupt loss of homology immediately downstream of the transcription termination point of the gcvP gene. The region of non-homology extends for at least 130 base pairs beyond the gcvP transcription terminator. Sequences spanning this region in marker-negative isolates exhibited a high level homology with that determined for E. coli K-12. The origin of the sequence for the same region in marker-positive isolates was unable to be identified. 9. The utility of the marker for environmental monitoring was investigated in a field study of a rural stream receiving bacterial contamination of both human and animal origin. The marker was consistently detected both in isolates derived from sewage effluents and in those found immediately downstream from sewage inputs-despite the presence of a high background of E. coli of animal origin. However the utility of the marker as a sewage-specific tracer was limited by the relatively low numbers of marker-positive d. coli in sewage effluents (approximately 8%). 10. In summary, the work described in this thesis has confirmed the need for multiple indicator systems in water quality monitoring and has identified appropriate areas for further research. The most promising area for future research is in the development of molecular tools which might provide both a better understanding of genetic variation in indicator organisms and enable methods to be developed for the detection of host-specific strains. Location of other polymorphisms likely to be present in the E. coli genome should enable further host-specific markers to be identified which could complement the 'human' marker identified in this study.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2375</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biological studies on turnip yellow mosaic virus in Brassica pekinensis</field><field name="creator">Fraser, Lena</field><field name="description">1.

Inoculation of a cotyledon leaf of Chinese cabbage seedlings with turnip yellow mosaic virus produced a rapid transient inhibition in the rate of leaf initiation, so that infected plants developed 0.5 to 1.0 leaf less than healthy plants. 3. The factor that initiated the inhibitory response a t the apical. meristem began moving out of the inoculated cotyledon within 1to 6 hours after inoculation, thus preceding the movement out of the inoculated cotyledon of infectious virus or RNA which was not detectable until about day 5. 4. The transient inhibition of leaf initiation occurred following inoculation with any one of three unrelated viruses, or with infectious turnip ye1low mosaic virus RNA. 5. A factor eluted in an active form from the cut petioles of inoculated 1eaves. 6. It is necessary to inoculate with infectious virus or RNA to initiate the production of the inhibitory factor. 7. No differences were seen in the magnitude or timing of the reduced rate of 1eaf initiation, when the concentration of turnip yellow mosaic virus in the inoculum was varied between 1 &#181; g/ml and 100 &#181;g/ml. 8. Inoculation of the cotyledons of Chinese cabbage seed1ings with turnip ye1low mosaic virus caused a marked disturbance in the mitotic index a t the apical meristem between 6 and 48 hours. 9. A reduction in the accumulation of starch in the chloroplasts of cell s in the apical meristem occurred at 6 t o 24 hours after inoculation of the cotyledon 1eaf. 10. Abscisic acid applied to the cotyledon in a single 20 &#181;1 dose, elicited a response that closely paralleled the events that took place when Chinese cabbage seedlings were inoculated with turnip yellow mosaic virus. A decrease in the rate of leaf initiation began 1 t o 2 days after application and the inhibition of leaf initiation was preceded by a disturbance in the mitotic index in the apical meristem. 11. Gibberellic acid applied with the eluate from virus-inoculated leaves, was able to overcome the inhibition of leaf initiation. 12. The leaf inhibition assay in Chinese cabbage seedlings is a sensitive bioassay for abscisic acid.

Calpain 3 transcripts encoding the murine homologue were also described from mouse PBMCs and from murine tissues involved in haematopoiesis.  In addition to the confirmation of Calpain 3 expression in non-skeletal muscle tissues in both these species, transcripts were identified with precise and defined deletions, which mapped to known exon-exon boundaries in the Calpain 3 gene from both species.  These deletions constituted the removal by alternative splicing of skeletal muscle-specific components of the Calpain 3 protein known to regulate its function in this tissue.  Monoclonal antibodies to the Calpain 3 protein were used to confirm the presence of Calpain 3 protein in non-skeletal muscle tissues of both human and mouse.  In humans the expression of Calpain 3 protein was confirmed in PBMCs and in the mouse, Calpain 3 expression was confirmed in tissues of the haematopoietic compartment.  In both species the Calpain 3 protein expressed correlated with translation from a transcript lacking the skeletal muscle-specific components generated by alternative splicing.  An attempt was made using a Yeast Two Hybrid assay to identify potential regulatory molecules of Calpain 3 in human PBMCs, but without a definitive candidate molecule being found.  A developmental model of muscle differentiation (murine C2C12 myoblast cells) was used to ascertain the expression profile of Calpain 3 in the early stages of myofibrillogenesis.  Using Quantitative Real Time PCR the expression profile of Calpain 3 was assessed in differentiating C2C12 cells.  These results showed that the absolute levels of Calpain 3 transcription were elevated during differentiation and that a temporal Calpain 3 isoform shift occurred during this process.  This temporal shift in expression was from transcripts having identical deletions to those seen in the haematopoietic tissues, to full length transcripts representative of skeletal muscle-specific Calpain 3. The identification of Calpain 3 expression outside skeletal muscle tissue is novel and the isoforms expressed in these tissues are structurally more analogous to the ubiquitously expressed calpains.  This has implications for LGMD2A where a loss of function of Calpain 3 in non-skeletal muscle tissue could be compensated for by the ubiquitous calpains, thus explaining the lack of any non-muscle tissue pathology in LGMD2A patients.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mammalian, Calpain 3, Alternative-splicing</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2490</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discovery of the novel mouFSnrp gene and the characterisation of its in situ expression profile during mouse neurogenesis</field><field name="creator">Bradoo, Privahini</field><field name="description">Recently, a novel protein family, named as neural regeneration peptides (NRPs), was predicted across the rat, human and mouse genomes by one of my supervisors, Dr. Sieg. Synthetic forms of these proteins have been previously shown to act as potent neuronal chemoattractants and have a major role in neural regeneration. In light of these properties, these peptides are key candidates for drug development against an array of neurodegenerative disorders. The aim of this PhD project was to provide confirmation of the existence of a member of the NRP coding gene family, annotated in the mouse genome. This gene, called mouse frameshift nrp (mouFSnrp), was hypothesised exist as a -1bp frameshift to another predicted gene AlkB. This project involved the identification of the mouFSnrp gene, and the characterisation of its expression pattern and ontogeny during mouse neural development. Through the work described in this thesis, the mouFSnrp gene was identified in mouse embryonic cortical cultures and its protein coding gene sequence was verified. mouFSnrp expression was shown to be present in neural as well as non-neural tissues, via RT-PCR. Using non-radioactive in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemical colocalisation studies, interesting insights into the lineage and ontogeny of mouFSnrp expression during brain development were revealed. These results indicate that mouFSnrp expression originates in neural stem cells of the developing cortex, and appears to be preferentially continued via the radial glial lineage. mouFSnrp expression is carried forward via the neurogenic radial glia into their daughter neuronal progeny as well as postnatal astrocyte. In the postnatal brain, mouFSnrp gene transcripts were also observed in the olfactory bulb and the hippocampus, both of which are known to have high neurogenic potential. In general, the radial glial related nature of mouFSnrp expression appears to be a hallmark of the mouFSnrp expression pattern through out neural development.  This thesis provides the first confirmation of the existence of a completely novel gene, mouFSnrp, and its putative -1 translational frameshifting structure. Further, preliminary data presented in this thesis regarding the mouFSnrp in situ expression pattern during mouse brain development may suggest a key role of the gene in neuronal migration and neurogenesis in mice.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neural regeneration</field><field name="subject">Neuronal migration</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2431</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of trends and reasons for rising acute medical admissions in Auckland's public hospitals</field><field name="creator">Benipal, Jagpal Singh</field><field name="description">The main purpose of this study was to examine empirically the trends and reasons for rising acute adult medical admissions at two major public hospitals in Auckland from 1997 to 2004. According to recent national and international literature published on the topic, there has been unsustainable growth in the adult medical admissions both in NZ and most of the other developed countries. Overall, the causes of this increase have not been explored sufficiently in the literature reviewed. The NZ research has largely focused on the macro-analysis of hospital throughput data from health policy points of view. Methodology: A mixed methodology research design was applied to address the problem. Phase 1 quantitatively analysed adult medical hospital admission data (N = 277,416) obtained from the two hospitals (Middlemore and Auckland Public Hospitals), and phase 2 qualitatively explored the responses and views of the health professional expert panel (n = 16) in relation to the findings of phase 1 of the study. Findings: Overall, the crude number of admissions and age-standardised admission rates at both hospitals increased more rapidly than actual population increases. Approximately 1/3 of the patients accounted for 2/3 of the total admissions. Five major diagnostic categories accounted for 70%-80% of total acute admissions, with circulatory and respiratory system disorders being the leading causes of medical admissions. There was a strong relationship between age and increased admissions. MMH hospital overall, and its ethnic groups separately, had significantly higher admission rates than APH. Comparison of ethnic groups highlighted significant variations in the admission rates at the two hospitals despite adjusting for age, morbidity and deprivation. Conclusions: Overall the increase and variation in admission rates between the hospitals and ethnic groups was dependent on factors such as the characteristics of the population and patients, hospital admission and administration processes, availability of hospital beds, medical management at the hospital, and availability of primary and community care services. By making changes to those factors in the control of hospitals and District Health Boards, hospitals can potentially influence the trajectory of rising medical admissions. These factors include systems for managing patients with chronic illness, and pathways from community services to hospital. Finally, a number of future research areas, such as a large-scale study to explore the health service utilisation of the 55+ age groups, have been proposed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2419</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The indigenous factor: exploring kapa haka as a culturally responsive learning environment in mainstream secondary schools</field><field name="creator">Whitinui, Paul</field><field name="description">Recent research focusing on improving educational outcomes for M&#257;ori students in mainstream secondary schools in Aotearoa/New Zealand have asserted that building positive student-teacher relationships in the classroom are fundamental (c. f. Bishop, Berryman, &amp; Richardson, 2003; Bishop &amp; Tiakiwai, 2003; Ministry of Education, 2002, 2006). In contrast, attempts to investigate the educational benefits associated with M&#257;ori students participating in cultural learning activities, such as kapa haka, and the implications for improving levels of M&#257;ori student achievement, remains relatively unexplored. To embark on such an investigation, M&#257;ori kapa haka students and teachers from four mainstream secondary schools were invited to take part in an interview process informed by using a Kaupapa M&#257;ori theoretical approach. As a result, the study revealed quite emphatically that not only does kapa haka provide M&#257;ori students with an appropriate &#8216;culturally responsive&#8217; learning experience, but that they also feel more confident and optimistic about school and their education. Moreover, kapa haka provides the opportunity for students to celebrate who they are as M&#257;ori and as &#8216;culturally connected&#8217; learners in mainstream schooling contexts. In addition, M&#257;ori students through the kapa haka experience learn to &#8216;protect&#8217;, &#8216;problem-solve&#8217;, &#8216;provide&#8217;, and &#8216;heal&#8217; their inner self-worth, essence and wellbeing as M&#257;ori. Similarly, most teachers agreed that kapa haka provides M&#257;ori students with a creative, dynamic and powerful way to access their learning potential as cultural human beings. An overwhelming response by both students and teachers is that kapa haka should be timetabled as an academic subject to provide greater access to indigenous and cultural performing art that affirms their identity as M&#257;ori, and our uniqueness as New Zealanders. Finally, the research proposes a &#8216;culturally responsive&#8217; learning strategy to assist what mainstream secondary schools and teachers provide as valid and purposeful learning opportunities for &#8216;culturally connected&#8217; learners who are M&#257;ori.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2377</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dancing to the music of your heart: home schooling the school-resistant child. A constructivist account of school refusal</field><field name="creator">Stroobant, Emma</field><field name="description">School resistance is usually understood as a pathological behaviour or condition indicative of underlying mental disorder for which therapy is &#8216;indicated&#8217; and home schooling is &#8216;contraindicated&#8217;. However, I argue that the psychiatric/psychological classifications commonly used to identify school resistance (i.e. &#8216;school phobia&#8217; and &#8216;school refusal&#8217;) are socio-historical constructs that function to socially and discursively position school-resistant children as &#8216;abnormal&#8217;, &#8216;irrational&#8217;, &#8216;dysfunctional&#8217; and &#8216;sick&#8217; individuals whose problems are likely to be compounded by school withdrawal. Assuming that school resistance and home schooling can be constructed in multiple and competing ways, I explore the perspectives of seven school-resistant children who are being (or have been) home schooled, their mothers, and nine practitioners working with children. I argue that by applying a different set of assumptions to school resistance, the meaning of this phenomenon can be radically transformed and so too can the experiences of school resisters and their families. This research suggests that for some mothers and their school-resistant children, home schooling can provide an acceptable and effective solution to the problems raised by school resistance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2429</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Orphans of the imagination: exploring boundaries of culture/class in New Zealand education</field><field name="creator">Spencer, Melissa</field><field name="description">At different moments in New Zealand&#8217;s social history anxiety about particular groups of boys has been a focal point of public and official discourses about the state of the society, and education&#8217;s function within it. These moments, in common, are dominated by prevailing perceptions of moral and normative breakdown; of social crises in one form or another. Recent concerns about the so-called problem of boys&#8217; educational underachievement have been no exception. What has shifted over time is the discursive construction of problem boys; from their unequivocal characterisation as &#8216;villains&#8217; in the society to their constitution as &#8216;victims&#8217; of it. In this thesis I utilise a critical analysis of state, public and educational discourses about &#8216;problem&#8217; boys at different historical junctures as a lens to examine continuity and change in the configuration of the state/society relation in New Zealand, and education&#8217;s pivotal role within it. I argue that the discursive production of meanings about education occurs within the wider society and tends to be dominated by fractions of the middle class. The institutionalisation of particular dominant discourses about schooling, however, is mediated by the state formation specific to each moment. Through education, and in other ways, the state has a significant role in the regulation, constitution and re-shaping of individual and collective identities. I maintain that while internal and external socio-economic and political transformation over time has wrought inevitable changes in state form and techniques of governmentality, there are discernable continuities between the liberal/paternal state and its predecessors. Education remains both as a nexus of the state/society relation and as a key site of discursive struggles within and between them. I suggest that the current critical literature on boys and schooling is constrained by its own gender frame of reference. It cannot account for the multidimensional, historically embedded, contextually specific and socially produced understandings about education, gender, class and ethnicity that powerfully inflect contemporary and historical concerns about different groups of boys in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2427</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Georges Bernanos, d&#233;molisseur d'impostures</field><field name="creator">Carlyle, Diane P.

The first consists of a revue of the opinions of the critics on the work of Georges Bernanos, and then proceeds to define the aims of the thesis: (i) to combat the pernicious idea that we are dealing with a "Catholic Opus", one where the term "Catholic" would imply "idealistic" or "out of touch with reality", and to arrive at a different way of approaching the work; (ii) to lay bare the hidden unity of the work since the new interpretation we are seeking will derive from the relation of the parts to the whole; (iii) to show the radical nature of Bernanos's thought which lays bare the roots of the Discontents of our Civilisation and, by so doing, imparts a prophetic tone to his writings. In the second part Bernanos is placed within the context of his times and compared to other intellectuals, both Catholic and non-Catholic, in order to separate the "Catholic" from the "non-Catholic" elements in his work. Next, using the methods of Charles Mauron, we study the Youthful Works. In the third part, following the methods of Lucien Goldmann, we place the Novels in the context of Ecclesiastical Politics. In the fourth part we trace the transformation of the Novelist into the political pundit, then we go back to La Grande peur des bien-pensants to retrace the origins of his political thinking. Chapter twelve, "Birth of the Modem World", traces the development of capitalism in France and concomitant evolution of the value-system and ways of thinking.

The lower molecular weight (&#946;-particle) glycogen was found to be extremely labile, while the higher molecular weight (&#945;-particle) exhibited a far lower metabolic activity, indicating that it may act as a glycogen store for mobilisation in stress situations. These observations, coupled to the existence of Pompe&#8217;s Disease, a glycogen storage disease involving the lysosomal system, supports the hypothesis that &#945; - and &#946; -particulate glycogen may be partially separated from one another within the cell i.e. compartmentalised. By the use of a rapid differential centrifugation technique it was possible to show, both physiochemically and ultrastructurally, the existence of glycogen of a very large molecular size associated with the lysosomal fraction. This glycogen exhibited a different molecular weight distribution from that isolate from the liver as a whole i.e. cytosol + lysosomal. It is suggested that appreciably more than 10% of cellular glycogen is located within the lysosomes and that this is of predominantly high molecular weight. The size-distribution of liver glycogen was shown to be distinctly affected by the anti-inflammatory drugs, salicylate and Indomethacin. By measurement of the incorporation of radioactive glucose into glycogen, salicylate was shown to have a depressing effect on overall liver glycogen metabolism. These effects appear to arise from a stabilisation of the lysosomal membrane by the drugs. The incorporation, via liposomes, of purified anti-1,4-&#945;-glucosidase antibodies into the liver lysosomes of normal Wistar rats and rats with a genetic deficiency of phosphorylase kinase, caused a distinct decrease in 1,4-&#945;-glucosidase activity and in the content of high molecular weight glycogen. These changes were enhanced by prolonged liposomal-antibody treatment and suggested that a possible feedback control mechanism operates in the incorporation of glycogen into lysosomes. The 1-4- &#945; -glucosidase inhibitor, Acarbose, when injected intraperitoneally into normal and phosphorylase kinase-deficient rats similarly disturbed liver lysosomal metabolism, causing distinct and persistent inhibition of enzymes and acute disturbances of lysosomal glycogen metabolism. Again a feedback control mechanism appears to operate, which effects cytosolic carbohydrate metabolism. The biochemical effects closely resembled those occurring in Pompe&#8217;s disease and were confirmed by electron microscopy. A model for the adult form of the lysosomal storage disease has been suggested.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2380</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Te Puna : the archaeology and history of a New Zealand Mission Station, 1832-1874</field><field name="creator">Middleton, Angela</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the archaeology and history of Te Puna, a Church Missionary Society (CMS) mission station in the Bay of Islands, New Zealand. Te Puna was first settled in 1832 following the closure of the nearby Oihi mission, which had been the first mission station and the first permanent European settlement in New Zealand. Te Puna, located alongside the imposing Rangihoua Pa, was the home of missionaries John and Hannah King and their children for some forty years. As well as being a mission station, Te Puna was also the site of the family&#8217;s subsistence farm. The research is concerned with the archaeological landscape of Te Puna, the relationship between Maori and European, the early organisation and economy of the CMS, the material culture of New Zealand&#8217;s first European settlers, and the beginnings of colonisation and the part that the missions played in this. Artefacts recovered from archaeological investigations at the site of the Te Puna mission house are connected with other items of missionary material culture held in collections in the Bay of Islands, including objects donated by the King family. The archaeological record is also integrated with documentary evidence, in particular the accounts of the CMS store, to produce a detailed picture of the daily life and economy of the Te Puna mission household. This integration of a range of sources is also extended to produce a broader view of the material culture and economy of missionary life in the Bay of Islands in the first half of the nineteenth century. The humble, austere artefacts that constitute the material culture of the Te Puna household reveal the actual processes of colonisation in daily life and everyday events, as well as the processes of the mission, such as schooling, the purchase of food and domestic labour, the purchase of land and building of houses, the stitching of fabric and ironing of garments. These practices predate, but also anticipate the grand historical dramas such as the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi, glorified but also critiqued as the defining moment of the relationship between Maori and Pakeha and of colonisation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420305 New Zealand cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2381</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Par erruer: error analysis and the early stages of adolescent foreign language learning</field><field name="creator">Peddie, Roger</field><field name="description">Error Analysis has been widely used in studies of second language learning. At the same time, foreign language learning (as opposed to teaching), has largely been ignored as an object of research. The research had three major aims: to examine the potential of Error Analysis in foreign language learning by the development and trialling of a complex new coding schedule for analysing learner errors in French; to provide some descriptive data on the written errors and performance of foreign language pupils over a complete scholastic year; and to explore the nature of foreign language learning strategies used by the pupils studied. The thesis opens with a statement of purpose and method. This is followed by a short discussion of theories, topics and techniques in second and foreign language learning. The development of two forms of the coding schedule used to analyse errors is described and discussed. Recode checks and the development of 'Coding Confidence Levels' are presented. Procedures used in a longitudinal study of errors are then described. This study acted as an important trial for the coding schedules, known as Foreign Language Error Analysis: French (FLEAF). All written French produced by eight pupils in the same school class was collected over the 1978 New Zealand school year (February to December). The group were in their second year of high school French and had an average age of 14 years 5 months midway through the study. Background information is given about the subjects, including results of selected IEA French (Population II) tests administered during the year. Some description of the year's work is given, followed by general and case study analyses of errors. Selected results from both the longer (FLEAF-L) and shorter (FLEAF-S) coding schedules are then tabulated and discussed. Particular attention is paid to variables coding possible explanations for errors. Detailed analyses of errors in word order, negation and gender are offered, along with a review of correct performances for selected aspects. These analyses lead to two preliminary hypotheses which could in part explain the occurrence of errors. One hypothesis relates to the frequency with which pupils had been required to focus through drills on the point at issue, the other to the number of choices available to the pupil at the time of error. Discussion of Error Analysis and pupil strategies is then presented. It is concluded that Error Analysis has a valid role in developing hypotheses for a theory of foreign language learning. Five such hypotheses, suggested by the longitudinal study, are presented. It is argued that these five could all be classified on one of a proposed five levels of 'Operating Procedures' (McLaughlin, 1978a). Selection of a unique cluster of operating procedures would constitute the learning/performance 'strategy' of a particular pupil. These notions are incorporated into a tentative framework for a theory of foreign language learning. A modified 'Principle of Least Effort' (Zipf, 1965), is suggested as a key factor in the early stages of learning a foreign language, and ideas for subsequent research are proposed.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2382</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Error and self-correction in reading and oral language</field><field name="creator">Ng, Seok Moi</field><field name="description">The aim of this one year descriptive longitudinal study was to investigate the efficient strategies some competent novice readers used while learning to read in an existing reading programme for which text reading was the main instructional task. The prior teaching of sounds or of words in isolation or in lists was not emphasized in this programme. The authors of the texts tried to use the language of New Zealand Children. These texts provide the support for the Auckland child who comes to the new task of reading with a set of responses learnt from his past experience with oral language. Other important questions of the study related to whether children in such a programme could read not only unseen classroom texts, but also texts from a programme with a decoding emphasis. Fifty-two competent readers were chosen by a stratified random sampling method from 242 six-year-old children attending 20 randomly selected schools in Auckland. Strategy usage in oral reading was related to 3 factors: learning opportunities over time, (at 6:0, 6:6 and 7:0); reader proficiency, (Average, High Average, Good and Excellent); and text difficulty, (Easy, Moderately Difficult, Difficult and Phonically Regular). The children&#8217;s performances on oral reading and an oral sentence repetition test at 6:0 and 7:0 were compared. The data comprising errors and self corrections were analyzed at three linguistic levels (graphemic/phonemic, syntactic and semantic), to infer strategies. The Friedman two-way analysis of variance test for related samples was used for most comparisons. Th level of significance was set at p&lt;0.05. The findings suggest that the Auckland child used the facilitating effects of meaning and structure in both reading and sentence repetition tasks. The control which children gained from 6:0 to 7:0 over texts with the decoding emphasis was achieved by attention to both graphemic cues and cues from structure and meaning. The competent novice reader also showed flexibility in selecting different strategies to deal with easy, familiar texts and difficult or novel texts. Such strategies are a necessary part of a model of mature reading which dies not see reading as exclusively the use of anticipatory mechanisms nor solely the use of sequential letter-by-letter processing. The competent novice reader was apparently learning to use either, or combinations, of these processes. The results of the study highlight the complex nature of learning to read and suggest that while some teaching programmes that emphasize a particular learning strategy may be successful, they may not take full advantage of other equally valid strategies which children can develop.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2384</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene sequencing and in vitro synthesis of the rotavirus non-structural glycoprotein</field><field name="creator">Powell, Kevin F. H. (Kevin Frederick Herbert)</field><field name="description">1. Recombinant DNA techniques have been applied to the dsRNA genome of the bovine rotavirus Nebraska Calf Scours Diarrhoea virus (NCDV). The sequence of a full - length cloned copy of genomic segment 10 of NCDV has been determined using the Sanger dideoxynucleoside sequencing technique by subcloning cDNA into M13 vectors. 2. Genomic segment 10 codes for the non-structural protein NCVP5, a protein which appears to be involved in virus maturation (Estes et al., 1983). Determination of the nucleic acid sequence of the gene has enabled the amino acid sequence o f the bovine NCVPS protein to be inferred. Comparison of the inferred amino acid sequence with homologous sequences derived from other virus strains (Both et al., 1983c; Baybutt and McCrae, 1984; Okada et al., 1984; Ward et al., 1985) has enabled conserved regions of the molecule to be identified. A small region of the NCVPS protein has been identified (residues 131-161) which exhibits considerable variability between rotavirus strains. 3. A computer-based algorithm has been utilised to predict the folding pattern of NCDV gene 10 mRNA. This reveals a 'panhandle ' structure which differs from that proposed for the related gene of strain Wa rotavirus (Okada et al., 1984) but both molecules possess a common feature in that the initiation codon falls within a potentially-stable duplex formed with a portion of the 3 untranslated region. 4. A series of four site-directed deletion mutants of the cloned gene were constructed in order to investigate the functional significance of the three N-terminal hydrophobic regions of the NCVP5 protein. Two mutants were constructed using conveniently-located HindIII and BamHI restriction enzyme sites. The other two mutants were generated using M13 vectors and synthetic oligonucleotides. These modifications yielded genes coding for proteins in which portions of the first and second hydrophobic regions had been deleted. 5. DNA corresponding to the 'wild-type' coding region was inserted into an SP6 transcription vector to enable mRNA to be produced in vitro. This mRNA, when incubated in a reticulocyte lysate, directed the synthesis of a protein of the correct size (20 K). The addition of dog pancreatic microsomes to the reaction yielded a protein product (29 K) of a size consistent with the glycosylated ('wild-type') form of the NCVP5 protein. 6. The four variant forms of the NCVP5 gene were also inserted into SP6 transcription vectors and the protein products synthesised by the resulting mRNAs studied. All four mRNAs directed synthesis of variant protein products of the anticipated size. 7. The ability of the four variant proteins to become glycosylated and to associate with membranes was investigated. The topology of the proteins in the membrane was examined by digestion with proteolytic enzymes. Variant proteins altered in the first or second hydrophobic regions retained their ability to associate with membranes, suggesting that the third hydrophobic region, which was not altered, might play a role in membrane association. 8. A model for the disposition of NCVPS in the endoplasmic reticulum is proposed in which the first hydrophobic region is located within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, the second hydrophobic region spans the membrane and the third hydrophobic sequence associates independently with the membrane from the cytoplasmic side leaving the C-terminus of the molecule exposed to the cytoplasm. The model proposed accounts for the experimental observations but is in conflict with current mechanisms proposed for the insertion of proteins into membranes.

The organo-complexes formed by this latter method are coordinatively unsaturated and the structure of RuCl(p-tolyl)(CO)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322; has been obtained by X-ray crystallography. The migratory insertion and reductive elimination reactions of these new compounds are discussed in chapters 2 and 3. Predictably, the Lewis base CO rapidly adds to these 16 electron species and the expected octahedral derivatives are formed. In some cases these are in equilibrium in solution with the corresponding dihapto-acyl complexes. The positions of the equilibria, the rates of interconversion and the relative solubilities of the two forms are such that in each case either essentially pure dicarbonyl or essentially pure dihapto-acyl can be isolated from solution. The dihapto-mode of bonding has been confirmed by X-ray crystallography for two of the derivatives. CNp-tolyl also adds to the 16 electron organo-compounds in an analogous fashion and equilibrium with the corresponding dihapto-iminoacyl compounds is attained in some cases. The dihapto-iminoacyl formulation has been confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Factors affecting the positions of all these equilibria are discussed and the possible relevance of these dihapto-acyl and -iminoacyl complexes as models for the proposed intermediates in the CO and CNR insertion reactions is noted. Compounds containing cis-H,R ligands are rarely stable since reductive elimination of R-H usually occurs very readily. Species of this type, therefore, appear to be ideal precursors for reactive, low valent complexes which are unobtainable by other means. A synthetic route has been developed by which an hydrido ligand can be incorporated into the coordination sphere of the new organo-derivatives described in chapter 1. The key step involves the thermal decarboxylation of a dihapto-formate ligand. In this way remarkably stable cis-H, tolyl complexes of osmium have been prepared. Toluene is eliminated from these derivatives only under forcing conditions. In contrast, reductive elimination from the analogous ruthenium complexes proceeds much more rapidly and in only one case has a stable hydrido, aryl complex been isolated. Other compounds that have been formed by this route are the zerovalent complex Ru(CO)(dppe)&#8322; and the ortho-metallated complex Ru(C6H&#8324;PPh&#8322;)H(CO)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322;. Factors affecting the rates of all these reactions are discussed. Some reactions of Ru(C&#8326;H&#8324;PPh&#8322;)H(CO)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322; have been investigated, and most notably a methyl, formate complex is produced with formaldehyde and a small amount of a dichlorocarbene complex with CCl&#8324;. The reactions of this ortho-metallated compound may proceed via the intermediate "Ru(CO)(PPh&#8323;)&#8323;". Extension of the synthetic procedure described in chapter 1 has led to the production of the dichlorocarbene complex OsCl&#8322; (CO)(CCl&#8322;)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322;, the structure of which has been determined by X-ray crystallography. This compound, which formally contains an Os-Ccarbene double bond, provides the subject matter for chapter 4. The carbene carbon atom is attacked by nucleophiles and the chloride substituents are easily displaced. This species therefore behaves as a remarkably versatile synthetic intermediate. Reaction with the chalcogen hydrides HX&#8315; (or H&#8322;X) leads to the corresponding chalcocarbonyl derivatives and OsCl&#8322; (CO)(CTe)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322; is the first tellurocarbonyl complex to be isolated. Characterization of this complex includes an X-ray crystallographic analysis. Primary mines react with OsCl&#8322; (CO)(CCl&#8322;)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322; to form the corresponding coordinated isocyanides and reactions with other nucleophiles are also discussed. The most important of these, however, is the reaction with Li(p-tolyl). This produces the monomeric carbyne complex, Os(Cp-tolyl)Cl(CO)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322;, the structure of which has been determined by X-ray crystallography. This compound has an extremely short Os-Ccarbyne bond length and this is consistent with a triple bond formulation. The synthesis and chemistry of this compound is discussed in chapter 5. Although other carbyne complexes have been isolated previously this is a relatively new area of organometallic chemistry and reports of the chemistry of these species are restricted mainly to compounds of the GpVIa and VIIa metals. Os(Cp-tolyl)Cl(CO)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322; displays a rather different chemistry from these compounds and some new reactions have been observed. Electrophiles such as H&#8330; and Cl&#8322; readily attack Ccarbyne and the corresponding carbene complexes are formed. This suggests that Ccarbyne is nucleophilic. The elements S, Se and Te add to the Os-Ccarbyne triple bond under ambient conditions to give the corresponding dihapto-chalcoacyl complexes. Adducts of the Os-Ccarbyne triple bond are also formed with the GpIb metals and the structure of Os(C{p-tolyl}AgCl)Cl(CO)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322; has been determined by X-ray crystallography. Analogues of all these reactions are to be found in acetylene chemistry. In contrast to the cationic carbyne complexes of the GpVIa and VIIa metals, Ccarbyne in [Os(Cp-tolyl)(CO)&#8322; (PPh&#8323;)&#8322;]ClO&#8324; is not attacked by nucleophiles. Instead LiBHEt&#8323; preferentially attacks the para-carbon atom of the Ccarbyne p-tolyl substituent and an Os(O) vinylidene complex is formed. The structure of this compound has been confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Although the aromatic ring is destroyed in this reaction it is replaced by an extensively conjugated system which reaches through to the osmium atom. Further reactions of this species and the cationic carbyne complex [Os(Cp-tolyl)(CO)(CNp-tolyl)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322;]ClO&#8324; are also discussed.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2387</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Colletotrichum acutatum Simmonds f.sp. pinea Dingley &amp; Gilmour: its persistence in soil and its infectivity of Pinus radiata D. Don seedlings</field><field name="creator">Nair, Janardhanan</field><field name="description">Persistence of Colletotrichum acutatum Simmonds f.sp. pinea Dingley &amp; Gilmour in pine nursery soils and its infectivity of Pinus radiata D. Don seedlings were studied. Sampling procedures were compared in the search of soils for fungal propagules. Those most frequently used were soil dilution plate method, surface-soil dilution plate technique, and plating of debris picked from soil. A selective medium for direct isolation from soil was prepared comprising potato dextrose agar as the basal medium and incorporating benomyl (50 ppm), quintozene (7.5 or 75 ppm), streptomycin sulfate (100 ppm), chloramphenicol (100 ppm) and chlortetracycline HCl (100 ppm). Studies in plots at Auckland, Tokoroa and Rotorua indicated that fungal structures within P. radiata debris persisted for long periods; up to 25 months in the Auckland plots. In vitro, the viability of conidia in natural soil declined very rapidly; more than 50% of conidia were non-viable within 4 weeks of their introduction into soil incubated at 15 and 25 C. Similar experiments conducted at different matric potentials indicated that drier soils (-0.3 or -0.4 bar) had higher levels of viable conidia over periods of time compared to wetter soils of -0.1 bar or at saturation. Segments of pine seedlings introduced to soils into which various concentrations of conidia were previously incorporated showed increasing colonization with increasing conidial concentration at both 15 and 25 C after 4 days. Maximum colonization of segments occurred at conidial concentrations 106 ml-1 to 107 ml-1. Artificially-inoculated segments of pine seedlings were introduced into soil and then these were recovered at different time periods. After two months in soil 100% recovery of the fungus was obtained from all leaf, stem and root segments plated. Recovery levels from all the plated stem and root segments after 8.5 months were never lower than 68%. Recovery levels from leaf segments were lower because many of these had decomposed leaving only the central xylem strands. Conidia-laden membrane filters were introduced into soil. A method of microscopic study used after removal of these from soil enabled easy observation of resultant structures. Appressoria were formed while the fungus was in soil. Other potential survival propagules were thick-walled, darkly-pigmented, short hyphae within pine debris. It is considered that the short individual cells of such hyphae could survive as chlamydospores, and these are believed to be the prime means of long-term survival in soil. Several fumigants were tested for effectiveness in eradication of the fungus from soil. All chemicals tested, namely chloropicrin, methyl bromide, "Di-Trapex" and dazomet significantly reduced viability of conidia and the fungus in pine debris. Weeds from a pine nursery were inoculated with conidia; of these, only Epilobium ciliatum Raf. became infected. Infection of healthy parts was infrequent but saprophytic growth in older parts frequently killed the plant. This species is therefore a potential alternative host, although its importance as an inoculum source for infection of pine seedlings is unknown. Experimentally it was shown that infection could occur by rain splash of conidia onto healthy plants. Infection of P. radiata seedlings was studied at several constant and alternating temperatures. Initial infection was greatest at higher temperatures (ca 24 C); while full symptoms of the disease were best expressed at lower temperatures (12 to 18 C). Inoculated seedlings had significantly reduced shoot and root development at 12, 15, 18 C, but not at 6, 9, 23, 24, 27 C, after 53 days. Increase in height of healthy seedlings was significantly greater than that of inoculated seedlings, after 52 days at 18 C. Pathogenicity on P. radiata seedlings of an isolate of C. acutatum f.sp. pinea isolated from soil, "whitish isolate", was comparable to the normal "coloured isolate".</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2388</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The structure and metabolism of mammalian glycogens</field><field name="creator">Calder, Philip Charles</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2389</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiple Objective Linear Programming in Radiotherapy Treatment Planning</field><field name="creator">Shao, Lizhen</field><field name="description">The aim of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is to kill tumor cells while at the same time protecting the surrounding tissue and organs from the damaging effect of radiation. To achieve these goals computerized inverse planning systems are used. Given the number of beams and beam directions, beam intensity profiles that yield the best dose distribution under consideration of clinical and physical constraints are calculated. This is called beam intensity optimization problem. In this thesis, we first review existing mathematical models and computation methods for the beam intensity optimization problem. Next, we formulate the beam intensity optimization problem as a multiobjective linear programme (MOLP) with three objectives. For clinical cases this optimization problem involves thousands of variables and tens of thousands of constraints and existing methods such as multiobjective simplex methods can not handle it. The rest of the thesis is dedicated to developing methods to solve this large MOLP efficiently and to the application in the beam intensity optimization problem. Benson (1998c) argues that solving an MOLP in objective space needs less computation time than solving it in decision space if the number of objectives of the MOLP is much smaller than the number of variables. Moreover, the constraint matrix of the problem relies on the calculation of dose deposited in tissue. Since this calculation is always imprecise solving the MOLP exactly is not necessary in practice. This motivates us to develop algorithms for solving an MOLP in objective space approximately. We summarize Benson&#8217;s outer approximation algorithm for solving MOLPs in objective space and propose some small changes to improve computational performance. Then in order to approximate the true nondominated set we propose a modification of Benson&#8217;s algorithm which is called an approximation version of Benson&#8217;s algorithm. Our approximation algorithm computes an inner and an outer approximation of the nondominated set. We prove that the inner approximation provides a set of &#949;-nondominated points. The geometric duality theory of Heyde and L&#168;ohne (2006) defines a dual to an MOLP and it assures us to be able to find the nondominated set of the primal MOLP by solving its dual MOLP. Based on this we develop a dual variant of Benson&#8217;s outer approximation algorithm to solve the dual MOLP in objective space. We prove that solving the dual provides a weight set decomposition. We compare the primal algorithm and the dual algorithm on small illustrative and on radiotherapy examples. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm to solve the dual MOLP approximately but within specified tolerance. This approximate solution set can be used to calculate an approximation of the nondominated set of the primal MOLP.We show that this set is an &#949;-nondominated set of the original primal MOLP and provide numerical evidence that this approach can be faster than solving the primal MOLP approximately. Considering that the set of nondominated points is infinite, it is not very useful from the planners&#8217; point of view. We address the problem of finding well distributed nondominated points for an MOLP.We propose a method which combines the global shooting and normal boundary intersection methods. By doing so, we overcome the limitation of normal boundary intersection method that parts of the nondominated set may be missed. Discrepancy analysis of the nondominated points from a geometry point of view shows that this method produces evenly distributed nondominated  points. Moreover, the coverage error and the uniformity level can be measured. Finally, we apply the algorithms developed to the beam intensity optimization problem of 3D clinical cases with voxel size of 5mm and 3mm. A technique of reducing the resolution in normal tissue has been used to reduce the computation time. The results clearly illustrate the advantages of our methods.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2478</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The young driver: a highway warrior?</field><field name="creator">Harre, Nicole</field><field name="description">Young drivers have high rates of injury in New Zealand and throughout the Western world. It is commonly perceived that a major reason for this is their tendency to engage in unsafe driving behaviours, something that has frequently been labelled &#8216;risk taking&#8217;. A study of the literature suggested that the term &#8216;risk taking&#8217; has been used in a variety of different ways and may have obscured our understanding of young people&#8217;s motives. Theories and research reviewed on the causes of unsafe driving behaviour amongst adolescents revealed a variety of potential contributors, ranging from the individual to the social. There is little evidence to implicate young women as unsafe drivers, who are most at risk as passengers. A survey of sixth form students (n=626) found high levels of unlicensed driving, breaking the rules associated with a restricted licence, failing to wear a seat belt in the back seat, speeding and being the passenger of a drinking driver. In addition, the survey found significantly more males than females reported: driving, engaging in unsafe driving behaviours, drinking and driving, speeding on the open road, breaking the night curfew associated with being on a restricted licence and dangerous thought patterns. Females were more likely to have been the passenger of a drinking driver after the last party they attended. Interviews with a sub-sample of those surveyed (n=16) revealed a number of scenarios that led to unsafe driving. These included: peer group dynamics, the adolescent sub-culture, emotional stress, an apparent lack of awareness of risk, and practical considerations. The interviews also indicated a lack of policing of the rules associated with the Graduated Driver Licensing System (G.D.L.S.). Interventions aimed at changing the behaviour of young drivers are examined and driver education is looked at in some detail. Problems with methodology made it difficult to reach clear conclusions about the efficacy of past programmes. Health education literature was analysed to ascertain what may be the ingredients of effective programmes for driving safety. An intervention study was carried out that compared a group of sixth form students who received a programme for driving safety (n=176) with a control group (n=146). Measures of attitudes, knowledge and self-reported behaviours yielded no significant differences between the two groups in either the post-test or the follow-up. A variety of reasons for this outcome are put forward, including the programme&#8217;s emphasis on thinking processes and its low fear approach. The recommendations that are made for decreasing the teenage road injury rate include: better policing of the G.D.L.S., education programmes and media campaigns that focus on the young male&#8217;s sense of personal immunity from risk, and increased availability of safe transport on occasions when young people are drinking. It is stressed that comprehensive safety plans that target all age groups are likely to have the greatest impact.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2390</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pakeha discourses of Maori/Pakeha relations</field><field name="creator">McCreanor, Tim</field><field name="description">This thesis uses a discourse analytic approach to the language used by Pakeha in talk about Maori in Aotearoa/New Zealand.

Aetiological literature reveals a wide range of causal explanations including biogenetic, social and cultural factors.  A major limitation of this body of research is the assumption of schizophrenia as a universal syndrome.  When viewed through an indigenous lens, experiences labelled schizophrenic by Western psychiatry have been found to vary from culture to culture in terms of content, meaning and outcome.  The current project aimed to investigate M&#257;ori ways of understanding experiences commonly labelled &#8216;schizophrenic&#8217;.  The philosophical frameworks that guided the research were Kaupapa M&#257;ori Theory and Personal Construct Theory.  A qualitative approach was used and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 57 participants including tangata whaiora (service users), tohunga (traditional healers), kaumatua/kuia (elders), P&#257;keh&#257; clinicians, M&#257;ori clinicians, cultural support workers and students.  Four categories were derived from qualitative thematic analysis.  These being: making sense of the experiences, pathways of healing, making sense of the statistics and what can we do about the statistics.  Overall, M&#257;ori constructions related to other indigenous constructions of mental illness and wellbeing cited in the international literature but were in stark contrast to current psychiatric constructions.  The current project indicated M&#257;ori participants held multiple explanatory models for extra-ordinary experiences with the predominant explanations being spiritual.  Other explanations included psychosocial constructions (trauma and drug abuse), historical trauma (colonisation) and biomedical constructions (chemical brain imbalance).  Based on these findings, recommendations for the development of culturally appropriate assessment and treatment processes are presented. Over the last couple of centuries a single paradigm, the medical model, has come to dominate the explanation and treatment of illness in Western society.  Via legal and political means, indigenous models of illness and wellness have been wiped out or forced to the margins of many societies.  This thesis aims to challenge the dominant medical model that has privileged psychiatric knowledges while suppressing others by repositioning indigenous construction at the centre of the research via a Kaupapa M&#257;ori framework. Chapter One aims to deconstruct current medical constructions by presenting psychiatry as a culture in itself as opposed to a discipline dedicated to scientific truths.  This chapter posits that the culture of psychiatry has lead many clinicians to suffer from &#8220;cultural blindness&#8221; when working with indigenous and ethnic minority groups.  Chapter One uses the tools of science to question the scientific validity and reliability of the construct &#8220;schizophrenia&#8221;.  I conclude that this construct is &#8220;unscientific&#8221; in itself.  I will also look at three themes highlighted by other researchers regarding the treatment of mental illness throughout Western history: treatments are used as a form of social control; treatments can be dehumanising; and the dominance and power of the medical model to define who and what is considered ill.   Chapter One also acknowledges the significant role of the consumer movement in developing more humane treatments.  Interactions between culture and psychiatry via colonisation are outlined in Chapter Two. I also critique research that is conducted cross culturally in terms of whether researchers attempt to establish the reliability of universal diagnoses or recognise local and unique constructions.  Chapter Two challenges the commonly cited finding of higher rates of schizophrenia for ethnic minorities and indigenous peoples by questioning the validity of foreign cultural constructs to explain indigenous forms of illness.  This chapter recognises indigenous and cultural constructions of what psychiatry labels &#8216;schizophrenic&#8217;.  To illustrate, three &#8216;culture bound syndromes&#8217; will be discussed.  The development of indigenous psychological paradigms is also presented to position the current research within this wider international movement.  Chapter Three summarises M&#257;ori constructions of illness and wellness.  This chapter predominantly draws from early anthropological literature and subsequent psychological studies to represent the resilience of M&#257;ori constructions of experiences commonly labelled schizophrenic.  In accordance with the experiences of other indigenous populations, this chapter also recognises the impact of colonisation on M&#257;ori beliefs and practices relevant to maintaining wellness.  To illustrate the effect of colonisation, disparities in statistics between M&#257;ori and non-M&#257;ori for admissions and readmissions to inpatients units for psychotic disorders will be discussed.  Explanations for these disparities will also be outlined.  Within Chapter Three, the resistance and revival of M&#257;ori constructions is also recognised as a function of the development of bicultural and Kaupapa M&#257;ori Services.  Chapter Four, summarises the theoretical orientation of the research.  This research is qualitative and assumes a post-modern critical paradigm.  Two theoretical frameworks were used within this research (Kaupapa M&#257;ori Theory and Personal Construct Theory) to represent the two worlds in which the research was conducted (Indigenous and Western).  Chapter Five outlines the methodology by recounting a somewhat layered journey.  Within the first section, &#8216;Who am I&#8217;, I have positioned myself by sharing my journey towards conducting this project.  The second section, &#8216;Where did I want to go&#8217;, outlines the research aims and process of consultation.  The final section summarises &#8216;What I did&#8217; in terms of qualitative interviews and the process undertaken for interpretation and presentation of the data.  Chapter Six presents the results of the research according to the four categories developed from qualitative analysis.  These were: &#8216;Making sense of extra-ordinary experiences&#8217;, &#8216;Pathways of healing&#8217;, &#8216;Making sense of the statistics&#8217; and &#8216;What can we do about the statistics&#8217;.  Within this chapter I have attempted to present quotes with as little interpretation as possible (over and above sorting of themes) to allow the reader to make their own interpretations before reading the discussion.  Chapter Seven summarises the major findings from each category and relates the results to the national and international literature.  Clinical and theoretical implications are discussed with recommendations for future research.  The limitations and strengths of the research are highlighted and conclusions drawn from the research journey.  The plan for dissemination is also presented.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">M&#257;ori psychology</field><field name="subject">schizophrenia</field><field name="subject">Kaupapa M&#257;ori theory</field><field name="subject">Indigenous psychology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3367</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of diabetic cardiomyopathy and its treatment by copper chelation</field><field name="creator">Glyn-Jones, Sarah</field><field name="description">Diabetes mellitus is estimated to affect approximately 7% of the populations living a western lifestyle. Of the multiple etiologies associated with diabetes, heart failure is the most common cause of death. A specific type of heart disease called diabetic cardiomyopathy is thought to be partially responsible. At this time, no one specific treatment is available for diabetic cardiomyopathy due to the wide variety of possible complex molecular changes, including metabolic disturbances, myocardial fibrosis, LV hypertrophy, and increased ROS production. Abnormal copper metabolism in diabetes has been proposed to form part of the pathway that leads to diabetic cardiomyopathy. Our group have shown that treatment with the copper (CuII) chelator, triethylenetetramine, ameliorates the effects of diabetes on the heart at both the functional and molecular level. This thesis aimed to further these studies by increasing our understanding of the mechanism of triethylenetetramine action on the diabetic heart. This was primarily achieved through the use of microarray technology but included the use of a range of molecular experimental techniques. During this investigation it was determined that the most suitable microarray platform for our studies was the Affymetrix GeneChip&#174; system. Using this system we identified more than 1600 gene changes associated with diabetes in the left ventricle wall. A disproportionate number of significant messenger RNA transcript changes were associated with the mitochondria and further investigation of these genes revealed changes associated with perturbed lipid metabolism and increased oxidative stress. A second study investigated the molecular mechanisms underpinning improved cardiac function in the left ventricle of the heart from diabetic and sham animals treated with triethylenetetramine. There was an observed decrease in diabetic cardiac tissue triglyceride towards normal, possibly through improvement of the structure and stability of the mitochondria. Only a small number of changes in gene expression were detected after triethylenetetramine treatment using microarray technology, and none were detected using real time-quantitative PCR. The final aim of this thesis was to understand the absorption and excretion of triethylenetetramine by both sham and diabetic animals. Our study found differences in the ability of diabetic animals to absorb and metabolise triethylenetetramine compared to sham animals. Also, the length of exposure was found to be an influencing factor in triethylenetetramine metabolism.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Diabetes</field><field name="subject">Copper chelation</field><field name="subject">Diabetic cardiomyopathy</field><field name="subject">Mitochondria</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2421</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DNA and RNA synthesis in leaves during TYMV replication</field><field name="creator">Bedbrook, John Robert Martin</field><field name="description">1.

Initial work concentrated on the construction of the biaryl linkage of bis-7- acetylnaphthalene 1.268 using a palladium(0)-mediated Suzuki-Miyaura homocoupling of the key triflate 1.269 (prepared in 10 steps from vanillin 1.271) using bis(pinacolato)diboron 1.179. This coupling method successfully afforded binaphthyls 2.8b and 2.8d which were subjected to attempts to effect either double bromination, double acetylation or double Fries rearrangement to a more functionalised biaryl system. Disappointingly, none of these methods allowed introduction of the key acetyl group at C-7 and C-7&#8217; onto the initial biaryls 2.8b and 2.8d. Attention then turned to the synthesis of the bis-7-acetylnaphthalene 1,268 that was required for the ensuing furofuran annulation reaction starting from triflate 2.7 that already contained an acetyl group at C-7, then effecting formation of the key biaryl linkage. Attempts to prepare 7-acetyltriflate 2.7 via either Fries rearrangement of acetates 2.33a or 2.9a, or via bromination of acetate 2.33a, naphthol 2.56 or benzyl ether 2.6 were unsuccessful. An alternative approach for the preparation of 7-acetyltriflate 2.7 involved the preparation of 2-acetylcarbamate 2.74 from carbamate 2.64 via a directed ortho-metalation, followed by reaction of the derived ortho-lithiated species with N-methoxy-N-methylacetamide 2.71. However, this strategy resulted only in low yields of the desired 2-acetylcarbamate 2.74, although initial model work did provide methodology for the successful conversion of carbamate 2.68 to 2-acetyl-l-naphthol 2.73. The synthetic target of this thesis shifted to the regioisomer of crisamicin A 2.77 when attempts to introduce an acetyl group atC-7 of triflate 2.9 failed. However formation of the 6-acetyltriflate 2.81b was successful from triflate 2.9b. A subsequent one-pot in situ Suzuki-Miyaura homocoupling of triflate 2.81b with boronate 2.89 furnished dimmer 2.76b. Oxidation of dimer 2.76b to bis-naphthoquinone 2.80 was then accomplished using silver(II) oxide and 6 M nitric acid. With the key bis-6-acetylnaphthoquinone 2.80 in hand, an efficient double furofuran annulation reaction was carried out using 2-trimethylsilyloxyfuran 1.88 affording the desired bis-furonaphthofuran adduct 2.79 as an inseparable l:l mixture of diastereomers 2.79a and 2.79b. However, initial experiments to effect the double oxidative rearrangement of bis-furonaphthofuran adducts 2.79 using either silver(Il) oxide and 6 M nitric acid or with ceric ammonium nitrate in aqueous acetonitrile to the bisfuronaphthopyran 2.7 8 were unsuccessful. Attention then turned to the preparation of bis-furonaphthopyran 2.78 from the 6-acetyltriflate 2.81b via initial oxidation of triflate 2.81b to naphthoquinone 3.3 followed by furofuran annulation and then oxidative rearrangement. Attempts to effect the key Suzuki-Miyaura homocoupling of furonaphthofuran 3.2 to bis-furonaphthofuran 2.79, or of furonaphthopyran 3.1 to bis-furonaphthopyran 2.78, using catalyst PdCl2(dppf) and ligand dppf were unsuccessful. The work achieved herein constitutes the synthesis of an advanced intermediate for the synthesis of the crisamicin analogue 2.79. The final synthesis of the regioisomer of crisamicin A 2.77 can be completed by preparing bis-furonaphthopyran bis-lactol 2.78 using more powerful palladium(0) catalysts and ligands for the Suzuki-Miyaura homocoupling of the monomeric furonaphthopyran 3.1. Subsequent reduction af 2.78 using triethylsilane and trifluoroacetic acid will then afford the bis-cyclic ether 3.15, which can undergo deprotection of the methyl ether and epimerisation at C-5 upon treatment with excess boron tribromide to finally furnish the regioisomer of crisamicin A 2.77. An investigation into the double oxidative rearangement of bis-furonaphthofuran 2.79 to the bis-lactol 2.78 could also be carried out by the use of several alternative oxidising agents, such as phenyliodine(III) bis(trifluoroacetate) (PIFA), phenyliodine(III) diacetate (PIDA), polymer-supported (diacetoxyiodo)benzene (PSDIB), Fremy's salt, iron trichloride or CrO3.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2393</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies in ionogram analysis and interpretation</field><field name="creator">Lobb, R.

The general principles are described in detail and the procedure is applied to the valley problem in bottomside ionogram analysis. It is shown that only a single parameter, the integrated valley ionisation, is obtainable from typical ionograms. The least-squares technique is then applied to the problem of topside ionogram analysis where the facility for using any mixture of ordinary and extraordinary ray virtual depth data is very useful. The method is shown to offer many advantages over the more traditional methods. The effects of horizontal ionisation gradients on bottomside and topside ionograms are extensively investigated by a new technique for synthesising ionograms corresponding to a given model of a moving disturbance in the ionosphere. A number of interesting and important ionogram characteristics are identified and explained. Finally, the specific problem of a large disturbance seen on total electron content records during summer nights is briefly re-examined using topside ionogram data. It is suggested that the disturbance is not primarily a topside phenomenon as originally supposed.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291700 Communications Technologies::291710 Radio communications and broadcasting not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2394</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the roles of transition metals in diabetogenesis</field><field name="creator">Chan, Yih-Kai</field><field name="description">Diabetic cardiomyopathy is one of the causes of mortality and morbidity associated with diabetes. Diabetes is a disorder characterised by chronic hyperglycaemia and cardiovascular complications. The relationship between these integrally linked conditions has long been recognised, and for a significant portion of individuals the two conditions co-exist as part of metabolic syndrome. The presence of diabetes increases the risk of heart failure up to fivefold and three-fold in women and men, respectively, when compared to individuals without diabetes. While there has been a significant declining trend in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in the general population over the past two decades, unfortunately such trends have not been seen among diabetic patients. As a result, this has persuaded many health professionals to re-evaluate their current treatment and pharmacological regimens. It is a well established fact that oxidative stress is a contributory mechanism in many agerelated disorders including T2DM, especially in those with poor glycaemic control. Thus far, clinical trials with antioxidant or carbonyl-trapping agents have produced mixed results, suggesting that the mechanisms underlying this disorder may be more complex than previously thought. Although altered systemic regulation of trace metals in diabetes has been previously investigated, it is still unclear whether changed trace metal metabolism would cause heart disease in common forms of diabetes and whether metal chelation can reverse this condition. Our hypothesis is that the accumulation of redox-active trace metals including Cu and Fe in cardiac muscle may, at least in part, result in cardiomyopathy through the generation of excess reactive oxygen species. We believed that the administration of a specific metal chelator should ameliorate this process by increasing the excretion of free systemic Cu and Fe, consequently limiting the production of superoxide oxygen free radicals and arresting the process of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Data from pre-clinical studies conducted in our laboratory using diabetic animal model with diabetes-induced abnormal Cu metabolism have been remarkably consistent in demonstrating that oral dosing with triethylenetetramine (TETA) can effectively remove systemic Cu via increased urinary Cu excretion, improve cardiomyocyte structure, reverse elevations in left ventricular collagen and &#946;1-integrin, and alleviate heart failure, all in the presence of a consistently high circulating blood glucose profile. Taken together, these findings support the beneficial role of TETA in diabetic animal model and lay the foundation for its potential therapeutic effect in humans with diabetes. This thesis describes a series of randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trials that have investigated the metabolism of Cu and Fe and seven other trace metals in patients with chronic T2DM compared with non-diabetic control subjects. This thesis also examines the mechanism of action of TETA and addresses the hypothesis that a decrease in body systemic Cu pool through chelation therapy may improve cardiac complication in diabetic subjects. Trial 1 is a randomised, double-blind, placebo- and diet-controlled study which measured the 6d balance of Cu and Fe and seven other essential trace metals, in twenty male T2DM and twenty age-matched control subjects in whom we later probed systemic metal balance with oral TETA. Basal urinary output and balance of Cu and Fe was significantly elevated in diabetes, and the two output values correlated strongly (p&lt;0.05). 6d treatment with 2400mg/d dose of TETA (maximum Wilson&#8217;s disease dose) has increased the urinary excretion of Cu, which was predicted by basal urinary Cu excretion, thereby causing a positive Cu balance to become negative in diabetes. Regulation of Cu metabolism was shown to be abnormal in diabetes and was selectively modified by TETA, which did not concomitantly modify Fe metabolism. Moreover, TETA did not cause a negative balance in any of the other seven trace metals monitored. These findings are consistent with TETA reversing the accumulation of free systemic Cu in diabetes, which may help to explain its potential therapeutic effects in some diabetic complications. Trial 2 investigated the acute response effect of a single 2400mg dose of TETA on urinary and serum trace metals in the first 10hr and 10~24hr post-dose. The results showed that TETA markedly increased the urinary Cu and Zn excretion in diabetes for the duration of 10hrs with the maximum excretion phase between 4~6hr post-drug (p&lt;0.05). TETA did not change the metabolism of Mg and six other essential trace metals monitored. Trial 3 examined the dose-response effect of TETA, at and below the dose given to patients with the Wilson&#8217;s disease over a 7d period, on Cu and eight other trace metals in a subgroup of seven T2DM and seven control subjects who had completed trial 1. The results of this i i trial showed that there was a linear dose-response relationship over the dose range 300~2400 mg/d on urinary Cu excretion in both T2DM and control subjects. However, there was no significant difference between the two subject groups at any of the four doses tested. In addition, 300mg/d of TETA was effective in mobilizing Cu in both T2DM and healthy control subjects. Trial 4 described the full work-up of a sensitive LC-MS methodology to identify and quantify TETA and its metabolite(s) in human urine. Using the LC-MS, TETA metabolism and excretion was investigated by analysing the urine of seven T2DM and seven control subjects who received escalating doses of TETA (samples obtained from trial 3). I have successfully identified and characterised two major metabolites of TETA in the urine of both T2DM and control subjects, N1-monoacetytriethylenetetramine (MAT) and diacetytriethylenetetramine (DAT), the latter which has not been previously reported. The results from urinary TETA excretion analyses also showed that T2DM may metabolise TETA more extensively than control subjects, which in turn is associated with its higher uptake or bioavailability. Urinary Zn excretion was mainly linked with urinary TETA and MAT in T2DM and healthy controls, respectively, whereas urinary Cu excretion was associated with urinary TETA excretion in healthy controls and urinary TETA+MAT excretion in T2DM subjects. These results suggest that MAT may also be involved in the mechanism by which TETA extracts systemic free Cu in diabetes. The identification of the two major metabolites of TETA and the development of a robust analytical LC-MS methodology reported in this study is an important step to further investigate the pharmacological actions of TETA in diabetic individuals. Collectively, the results presented in this thesis and in association with previous animal and clinical studies from our laboratory have provided consistent supporting evidences for the use of TETA clinically as a safe and effective therapy to prevent the genesis of some diabetic complications, in conjunction with conventional complication modifying therapies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Transition metals</field><field name="subject">Trace metals</field><field name="subject">Diabetes</field><field name="subject">Trace metal balance</field><field name="subject">Copper</field><field name="subject">TETA</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2422</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aroha mai: nurses, nursing and mental illness</field><field name="creator">Kidd, Jacqueline Dianne</field><field name="description">This research takes an autoethnographical approach to exploring the connections between being a nurse, doing nursing work, and experiencing a mental illness. Data is comprised of autoethnographical stories from 18 nurses. Drawing on Lyotard&#8217;s (1988) postmodern philosophy of &#8216;regimes of phrases&#8217; and &#8216;genres of discourse,&#8217; the nurses&#8217; stories yielded three motifs: Nursing, Tangata Whaiora (people seeking wellness) and Bullying. Motifs are recurring topical, emotional and contextual patterns which have been created in this research by means of the formation of collective stories from the content of the nurses&#8217; stories, artwork, fictional vignettes and poetry. Interpretation of the motifs was undertaken by identifying and exploring connected or dissenting aspects within and between the motifs. Using Fine&#8217;s (1994) notion of hyphenated lives, the spaces between these aspects were conceptualised as hyphens. The Nursing motif revealed a hyphen between the notion of the nurses as selfless and tireless carers, and the mastery requirements of professionalism. The nurses&#8217; hope for caring, belonging, expertise and &#8216;goodness&#8217; were also features of the nursing motif. The Tangata Whaiora motif revealed the hyphen between being a compliant patient and a self-determined person seeking wellness, and also foreshadowed the notion that the nursing identity does not &#8216;permit&#8217; the dual identities of nurse and tangata whaiora. This research has found that nurses who have experienced, or are vulnerable to, mental illness negotiate a nexus of hyphens between societal, professional and personal expectations of the nurse. Ongoing unsuccessful negotiation of their identities is exhausting and leads to enduring distress. At times, negotiation is not possible and the nurse is immobilised in a differend of silence and injustice. At such times, the only resolution possible for the nurse is to leave the nursing profession. Bullying surfaced as a feature of the hyphen between the nursing and tangata whaiora identities, as well as being a part of each identity as colonising, silencing and/or discriminatory acts. Successful negotiation between and among the nursing and tangata whaiora hyphens requires a radical restructuring of the nursing image and culture across the education, workplace and personal/clinical areas. Three strategies are proposed for the discipline of nursing to achieve this change: transformatory education, a conscientisation programme, and mandatory emancipatory clinical supervision.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mental distress</field><field name="subject">nurses and nursing</field><field name="subject">hyphenated lives</field><field name="subject">bullying</field><field name="subject">caring mastery</field><field name="subject">medal model</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::379900 Other Studies In Human Society::379902 Indigenous studies</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2414</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supporting the emergence of a shared services organisation: Managing change in complex health ICT projects</field><field name="creator">Day, Karen Jean</field><field name="description">Although there is a high risk of failure in the implementation of ICT projects (which appears to extend to health ICT projects), we continue to implement health information systems in order to deliver quality, cost-effective healthcare. The purpose of the research was to participate in and study the change management as a critical success factor in health ICT projects, and to examine people&#8217;s responses to change so as to develop understanding and theory that could be used in future change management programmes. The research was conducted within the context of a large infrastructure project that resulted from the emergence of a shared services organisation (from two participating District Health Boards in Auckland, New Zealand). Action research (AR) formed the basis of the methodology used, and provided the foundation for a change management programme: the AR intervention. Grounded theory (GT) was used for some of the data analysis, the generation of themes by means of constant comparison and the deeper examination of the change process using theoretical sampling. AR and GT together supported the development of theory regarding the change process associated with health ICT projects. Health ICT projects were revealed in the findings as exhibiting the properties of complex adaptive systems. This complexity highlighted the art of change management as a critical success factor for such projects. The fabric of change emerged as a composite of processes linked to project processes and organisational processes. The turning point in the change process from the before state to the after state is marked by a capability crisis which requires effective patterns of leadership, sensitive targeting of communication, effective learning, and management of increased workload and diminishing resources during the course of health ICT projects. A well managed capability crisis period as a component of change management can substantially contribute to health ICT project success.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems	280102 Information systems management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2476</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AP1: A Platform for Model-Based Software Engineering</field><field name="creator">Lutteroth, Christof</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the AP1 system, which serves as a platform for model-based CASE technology. AP1 is a set of libraries and tools that support different activities in the software development process. It provides different layers of reusable CASE functionality, and thus facilitates CASE tool development and integration. Some key problems of software development are addressed, such as the storage and management of artifacts, their creation and modification, and the generation of program code. The main parts of the abstract platform are a typed repository for models and model data, and a generic editor that acts as an integrated software development environment (IDE). The former enables data integration; the latter serves as a basis for presentation integration. Both parts have an extensible and customizable architecture that makes it possible for developers to adapt the system to their own individual needs.  The thesis discusses different data models, explaining why the parsimonious data model was chosen for the repository. A mapping onto the relational data model is given that makes it possible to leverage a RDBMS for data management. On top of the RDBMS, the AP1 system implements new mechanisms for caching, event notification and change control, resulting in a unique architecture. The thesis introduces novel concepts of robustness and reflection for user interfaces, and delineates their implementation in the generic editor. Furthermore, a concept for code generators is presented that offers a particularly high degree of type-safety, which we call generator type-safety.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">model-based software engineering</field><field name="subject">model-based development</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2464</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental analysis of the psychological effect of head injury</field><field name="creator">Gronwall, D. M. A. (Dorothy M. A.)</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to investigate the immediate consequences of concussion. Previous work had either concentrated on memory defects only, included cases of cerebral damage as well as concussion, or examined residual defects persisting after the period of impaired consciousness had ended. It was hoped to determine which function or functions might be affected in concussion by testing only young adult cases of 'pure' concussion in the immediate post-traumatic period. In the main experiment a paced serial addition task was administered to a mildly concussed (MC) and seriously concussed (SC) group at twenty-four-hourly intervals during the hospital period, and thirty to forty days after discharge. A normal control and hospital control group were given the task at similar time intervals. Recent concussion impaired performance and SC Ss needed almost five times as long as controls to process each correct response while MC Ss were about twenty per cent slower, However, responses were qualitatively similar in all groups, and concussed Ss differed only in producing many more late response errors. At retest the MC group had regained control level, but although SC Ss had significantly improved PASAT scores they were still poorer than the other three groups. Experiments II and III investigated stages in the information transmission process which may have produced restricted information processing shown by PASAT results. Reaction and movement times were not longer than normal, although central processing time was. MC Ss did not have significantly slower non-symbolic RTs, or symbolic two- and four-choice RTs, but they differed significantly from controls on eight- and ten-choice symbolic trials. Again this difference between groups was not found at retest four weeks later. Results suggested inefficient 'pigeon-holing' (Broadbent, 1971) as a possible factor in reduced information transmission following concussion. However, a message repetition task indicated no difference between concussed and non-concussed Ss in use of this mechanism. Message repetition also demonstrated that patients had no difficulty in auditory perception of verbal material. In the third stage, normal Ss were given message repetition with and without a concurrent distracting task. Performance during distraction was sufficiently similar to that of recently concussed Ss to suggest that the patient group may have been poorer than controls on the same task only because they also had reduced processing capacity. When given PASAT with a secondary paced task, performance of another group of normal Ss was almost identical to concussed Ss in the first experiment. Finally, to test the possibility that reduced processing capacity was the result of increased distractability, that is, processing task-irrelevant stimuli, an attention task (speech shadowing) was given to a small group of MC Ss and normal controls. There were no instances of intrusions or interference from an irrelevant message to indicate a defect in selective attention, although MC Ss had significantly lower shadowing scores. It was concluded that reduction in processing capacity produced by concussion was a function of patients' lower level of arousal, and that performance resembled that reported in the literature from sleep-deprived Ss and cases of brain-stem damage or dysfunction. A feature of results was the extremely competent performance exhibited by concussion patients, given a reduction in total capacity. Similar optimizing behaviour was evident during distraction tasks, and it was suggested that ability to monitor and control distribution of available processing space by instructions ('set') is a general characteristic of ordered behaviour. This ability was not disturbed by degrees of concussion sustained by experimental Ss in this study. Amnesic symptoms of the immediate post-traumatic period were considered in terms of lowered arousal level. It was proposed that these might be explained by a combination of two factors: (i) processing space insufficient to store items while responding to them, and (ii) tagging of items in storage with levels of concurrent background activity, and thus 'state-dependent' memory. Evidence for a processing deficit existing after termination of the period of PTA was reviewed, and the possibility of permanent effect in terms of increased disability following repeated concussions. Some aspects of results important in considering rehabilitation programmes for head-injured patients were noted.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2400</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Disclosure Rules, Manager Discretion and the Relative Informativeness of Earnings Components</field><field name="creator">Teixeira, Alan</field><field name="description">This is a study of earnings quality, examining whether components of earnings based on New Zealand (N.Z.) accounting classification systems have different information parameters. The N.Z. environment provides a unique opportunity to examine a period with no legislative backing of accounting standards and a flexible accounting standard. Combined, this gave mangers the ability to clearly identify earnings components they considered to be differentially informative. Informativeness is assessed by the ability of current period earnings to predict next period earnings and the contemporaneous relation between returns and earnings. The results indicate that disaggregated reported earnings are more informative than aggregated earnings in a non-trivial way. In one of the sample periods disaggregated earnings explained 29% of the variance in returns, more than twice the explanatory power of aggregated earnings. N.Z. accounting standard setters replaced SSAP7 with FRS7 in 1994 contending that the discretion available to mangers reduced the informativeness of earnings. Not only do the results not support that contention but earnings informativeness has fallen since FRS7 came into effect, suggesting that standard setters should revisit that decision. The results also have implications for the content and form of the N.Z. Stock Exchange (NZSE) preliminary announcement. "Unusual earnings" reported to the NZSE by companies are shown to be differentially informative to investors yet the NZSE does not always identify these components when the preliminary announcement is summarised and disseminated to market participants. To summarise, the effective codification of earnings brought about by FRS7 has reduced the informativeness of earnings &#8211; locking differences between components into total earnings. The N.Z. results beg the question as to whether similar economic events are locked into the COMPUSTAT summary earnings variables for U.S. data.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350100 Accounting, Auditing and Accountability</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2401</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the etiology of the leaf blotch disease of Eucalyptus spp. caused by Mycosphaerella nubilosa (Cke) Hansf</field><field name="creator">Ganapathi, Alhagananthan</field><field name="description">A detailed study of the leaf blotch disease, caused by Mycosphaerella nubilosa (Cke.) Hansf. on Eucalyptus regnans F. Muell (Mountain Ash) and E. delegatensis R.T. Baker (Syn. E. gigantea Hook. F., Alpine Ash) was made. The taxonomy of the fungus was studied(illustrations provided) and a previously unidentified imperfect state (Colletogloeum nubilosum) was described along with the spermagonial state (Asteromella). The histology and mode of infection process by ascospores and conidia was examined using Scanning Electron Microscopy, and wax and epoxy resin sections. The development of the fungus within the host was studied up to the stage of mature pseudothecia. The fungus was isolated from diseased tissue and Koch's postulates were carried out to prove pathogenicity. Detailed development of the leaf blotch and twig canker symptoms was followed in the field and in glasshouse conditions. The effect of substrate and environmental conditions on growth and sporulation of the fungus was studied. Controlled environment chambers and glasshouses were used. Several day/night temperature combinations (12/6, 18/12, 24/18 and 30/24C) as well as several light levels (50, 75, 150, 200, 300 and 650 &#956;E) were investigated. The optimum temperature for infection was 24/18C and least infection occurred at 12/6C. The optimum light level for infection was 300 to 650 &#956;E while the slowest infection was obtained at 50 and 75 &#956;E. Under constant temperature conditions infection was most severe at 18C for both E. delegatensis and E. regnans. Wetness periods under sprinklers of one to seven days were compared with similar incubation periods in polythene bags. One-day incubation produced very little infection compared with 2, 4 or 7 days. Incubation in polythene bags gave better results than sprinklers. Experiments showed that leaf and stem infection was not affected by nutrient levels. Leaf expansion rates for both the eucalypt species were followed for twelve weeks to determine the optimum leaf size for infection. Fungicide trials in the field and in-vitro suggested that several chemotherapeutants may be effective in controlling the disease. Diseased leaves from field trials were assessed for ascospore discharge to determine fungal viability. From this study it was shown that diseased (inoculated)"plants lost significantly more leaves than controls. If conditions were optimum for infection, tips of inoculated plants were killed, leading to stem distortion, branching and reduced growth. In general, the fungus causes severe damage on susceptible Eucalyptus spp. in sapling stages.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany::270403 Plant pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The second language acquisition of Mandarin nominal syntax</field><field name="creator">Charters, Areta Helen</field><field name="description">This thesis establishes a natural acquisition order for 18 nominal structures in Mandarin SLA, and assesses the extent to which that order can be explained as a consequence of cognitive processing demands. The natural acquisition order is based on a longitudinal study of three adults learning Mandarin in a classroom environment in Auckland, New Zealand. Two representatives of an average emergence order are derived from the three individual orders: a ranking of mean emergence times (RMT) and a ranking of mean emergence ranks (RMR). Processing demands are calculated in three different ways: once on the basis of six developmental stages identified in Pienemann&#8217;s Processability Theory (Pienemann, 1998c), once on the basis of a detailed analysis of each nominal structure according to the generative grammar of LFG (Bresnan, 1982, 2001); and finally on the basis of the Minimalist Programme (Chomsky 1995; 1999; 2000). All rest upon a prior analysis of lexical feature structures and constituent structures evident in the learner&#8217;s output over the course of a year. The standard six-stage model of Processability Theory proves unable to differentiate between most nominal structures, because they fall within the single developmental category of so-called &#8216;phrasal&#8217; structures. However, processing demands calculated on the basis either of LFG or of the MP prove to be highly correlated with both individual and average emergence orders. On the basis of these results, various generalisations are made about the relevance of different kinds of syntactic processes to the determination of emergence order. In particular, c-structural complexity and thematic structure are found to be factors most significantly associated with later emergence times. LFG and MP each provide interesting insights into different aspects of syntactic processing that impact on the acquisition of a second language; LFG throws light on the significance of the grammaticalisation of thematic structure; the MP throws light on the processes of lexical construction, and the interactions between this and constituent structure. Both indicate the significance of delays in feature valuation or unification as c-structural complexity increases.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420114 Chinese languages</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2405</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cytokinins and the division or expansion of plant cells</field><field name="creator">Beuning, Lesley L.</field><field name="description">The effect of cytokinins was studied in three systems: the alga Chlorella, callus cultures and etiolated cucumber cotyledons. In Chlorella cultures: 1) A range of concentrations of 6BA and IP had no effect on growth; 2) Low concentrations of an anticytokinin had no effect on growth, whereas higher concentrations appeared to be inhibitory. 3) Characterisation of the Chlorella species suggested that it was surrounded by an impermeable sporopollenin layer which hindered the uptake of cytokinin. 4) The uptake of radioactive adenine occurred readily, whereas the uptake of radioactive 6BA was very slow in both growing and saturated cultures of Chlorella. 5) Extracts isolated from Chlorella and the medium in which Chlorella was growing contained cytokinin-like activity in two bioassays. 6) HPLC analyses of these extracts showed that there were fractions which eluted at the positions of IP and IPA. In callus cultures: A.1) A carrot callus was grown from the secondary phloem of the storage root of carrot. 2) This callus, which was grown on 2,4-D and kinetin, produced roots and shoots when subcultured onto IAA and kinetin. 3) Growth on 2,4-D alone was independent of the presence of kinetin. 4) Growth was inhibited in the presence of an anticytokinin, suggesting that the callus produced a cytokinin. B.1) A tobacco callus was grown from a young leaf of tobacco. 2) This callus habituated to cytokinin independence following subculture onto lower concentrations of kinetin. 3) Subculture of the habituated callus onto a higher concentration of kinetin resulted in the production of roots and shoots. C.1) Cytokinin-dependent soybean and tobacco callus cultures were obtained from the Botany Department, University of Otago. 2) Analysis of the total proteins from suspension and callus cultures of soybean by 1-D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed one small 6BA-induced change in the proteins from the suspension cultures. In etiolated cucumber cotyledons: 1) 6BA caused the expansion of excised etiolated cucumber cotyledons after a 24h-hour incubation in the dark in a solution containing 6BA, in comparison to cotyledons incubated in water only. 2) The cotyledons curved upwards and in the light microscope the cells of the vascular bundles and the lower epidermis exhibited greater expansion than the upper epidermis. 3) Electron microscopic examination showed that the central vacuole of palisade cells from cotyledons treated with 6BA had expanded and that the cytoplasm had probably lost water and was compressed by the vacuole against the cell wall. 4) In contrast to other research, there was no apparent increase in polysome formation in 6BA-treated cotyledons in comparison to untreated cotyledons examined in the electron microscope. 5) A number of protein extraction methods were tried before a method was found which produced a protein extract suitable for both 1-D and 2-D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses. 6) 1-D and 2-D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that a number of proteins either increased or decreased following the treatment of cotyledons with 6BA. 7) A number of RNA extraction methods were tried, to obtain RNA suitable for translation in vitro. Only one method produced RNA which appeared to be free of contaminating substances. Weak translation of this RNA was obtained in vitro and it might be possible to develop conditions for optimal translation of the RNA given an adequate supply of an in vitro translation system.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2406</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the Metabolism of Plant Cells in Tissue Culture</field><field name="creator">Bellamy, A. R.</field><field name="description">1.	A tobacco cell-suspension tissue culture system derived from pith cells of Nicotiana tabacum L. var Wisconsin 38 was established. This system was used to study methods of purifying nucleic acids, phosphate ester and nucleic acid metabolism in cells subjected to nutritional shifts, and problems relating to the control of cell division in plant cells. 2.	Cell cultures consisting of single cells, groups of cells and small aggregates were maintained in liquid medium on rotary shakers. Cultures exhibited an exponential growth period during which the cell generation time was 2, 3 days. 3.	Cells removed from culture medium and resuspended in dilute inorganic salt solutions (step-down nutritional shift) exhibited marked changes in their phosphate and sulphate accumulation rates and in phosphate ester metabolism, but not in the type and rate of respiration. 4.	Such metabolic responses to culture shifts were not related to cell damage or shock effects, but appeared to be a feature of changes in the nutritional environment of cells. The response of cells to a step-down nutritional shift was maximal at exponential- and late-stationary phases of culture growth. Step-up nutritional shifts (resuspending cells in enriched culture medium) produced some effects similar to those found for step-down cells. Actinomycin D did not prevent the phosphate accumulation response of cells to culture shifts, and was shown to inhibit only 50 per cent of the synthesis of rapidly-labelled ribonucleic acid. 5.	RNA prepared from tobacco cells or rat liver by conventional phenol extraction was contaminated with other materials which composed as much as sixty per cent of the weight of the total preparation. RNA prepared from (32P) tobacco cells contained minor radioactivity in RNA but major radioactivity in a wide range of contaminating phosphate esters of high specific radioactivity. 6.	Purification of RNA by the Kirby two-phase partition procedure removed most major contaminants but failed to remove (32P) phosphate esters. The procedure also resulted in degraded RNA. 7.	A new method was developed for the purification of RNA prepared by the phenol procedure. It involved recovery of RNA from the upper phase of the two-phase Kirby extraction mixture by precipitation as the cetyltrimethylammonium (CETA) salt instead of by dialysis.  This procedure reduced manipulation times and much more effectively removed RNAase and (32P) phosphate esters from the RNA. 8.	TMV-RNA prepared by the new procedure was fully infectious. RNA prepared and purified from a mixture of whole rat liver and TMV was almost equally as infectious as RNA prepared from TMV alone. Infectivity of purified RNA, prepared from a mixture of tobacco cells and TMV, was stable in solution at 30&#176;C for four hours. TMV-RNA prepared in this way and stored at -12&#176;C in vacuo over P2O5 retained infectivity for at least 6 months. 9.	Extraction of (32P) exponential-phase cells by aqueous phenol plus detergent released only RNA with the ribosomal type of base composition. Similar extractions in the presence of high salt concentrations released this RNA together with DNA and rapidly-labelled RNA. 10.	During short treatments with (32P) orthophosphate, exponential-phase cells synthesised RNA with a base composition intermediate between that of ribosomal RNA and DNA. Cells subjected to a step-down nutritional shift prior to treatment with (32P) orthophosphate, synthesised RNA with a base composition close to that of tobacco DNA. 11.	Following treatment times with (32P orthophosphate, or (32P) plus (3H) uridine, and following a step-down or steady-state nutritional shift to non-radioactive medium, tobacco cells exhibited the following changes in phosphate ester and RNA metabolism:- a.	Changes in the levels of radioactivity present in the nucleoside triphosphate RNA precursors and other phosphate esters. b.	A reduction in the rate of increase of specific radioactivity of RNA of step-down cells, followed by a subsequent recovery. c.	Changes in the (32P) base composition of the RNA synthesised following the culture shift. d.	Changes in the radioactive sedimentation profiles of RNA. 12.	Extracts prepared from exponential-phase tobacco cells contained cytokinin (cell division stimulant) activity. Fractionation of cells, and bioassay of levels of cytokinins present in the various fractions, demonstrated the presence of soluble compounds with cytokinin activity in cell debris and cytoplasmic fractions, but not in the nuclear fraction. 13.	Unhydrolysed (polymeric) tobacco nucleic acids (RNA plus DNA), prepared from exponential-phase tobacco cells, showed no cytokinin activity. A ribonucleotide mixture prepared by alkaline hydrolysis of these tobacco-cell nucleic acid preparations, mixtures of purified ribonucleotides, or a mixture of tobacco deoxyribo- and ribonucleosides resulting from snake-venom digestion, contained no activity. Deoxyribonucleotides were inhibitory. 14.	A ribonucleotide mixture prepared by alkaline hydrolysis of RNA isolated from rat liver and sheep liver, contained cytokinin activity. Deoxyribo- and ribonucleoside mixtures resulting from snake-venom digestion of sheep-liver RNA and DNA contained similar levels of cytokinin activity to that found in extracts prepared by alkaline hydrolysis.</field><field name="date">1965</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2407</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The dehydrochlorination of 1,1-diaryl-2,2,2-trichloroethanes in protic and dipolar aprotic solvents</field><field name="creator">Wong, Ronald James</field><field name="description">PART I A general introduction is given to the mechanisms of olefin-forming &#946;-elimination. The development of mechanistic criteria and their application to the various reactions is discussed. Conflicting theories concerning the nature of the transition states of E2H reactions in protic solvents as well as the Winstein-Parker E2C-like transitions states for elimination by weak bases in dipolar aprotic solvents are described. PART II The use of primary deuterium isotope effects: structure-reactivity relationships, and rate-acidity correlations as mechanistic criteria for the E2 mechanism and the variants of the E1cB mechanism is reviewed. These criteria have been applied to the dehydrochlorination of the 1,1-diaryl-2, 2, 2-trichloroethanes (DDT-type compounds) with methoxide-methanol and t-butoxide-t-butanol. Literature comparisons indicate that the kinetic evidence for these two systems is in accord with an "irreversible" E1cB elimination pathway. PART III Characteristics of weak base-promoted eliminations in dipolar aprotic advents are reviewed. The evidence is not entirely consistent with either E2C or the E2H mechanism. Deuterium isotope effects and equilibrium constants are reported for the chloride ion-promoted elimination of the 1, 1-diary1-2,2,2-trichloroethanes in dimethylformamide and acetone respectively.

Chapter 1 comprises: a review of Vaska's compound, IrCl(CO) (PPh3)2 and related species, covering syntheses, structure and bonding and reactions of this very widely studied moiety; and brief reviews of metal-thiocarbonyl syntheses and reactions and metal-selenocarbonyl chemistry. These three reviews background the themes developed in this work; of preparations and reactions, particularly ligand reactions, of thiocarbonyl and selenocarbonyl analogues of Vaska's compound and species derived from IrCl(CE)(PPh3)2, E = S, Se. A new synthesis of IrCl(CS)(PPh3)2 is described in Chapter 2. The route employed involves preparation of dithioester complexes and facets of the reactivity of these species have been considered and a number of metallocycle derivatives prepared. Reductions of coordinated-thiocarbonyl groups have been considered; IrH(CS)(PPh3)3 was transformed into IrH2(SMe)(PPh3)3 by treatment with hydrogen, while the thiocarbonyl cation complexes [IrClX(CO)(CS)-(PPh3)2]+ were treated with borohydride to afford thioformyl species. Iridium alkyl, thiocarbonyl complexes have been prepared, and transformed by reaction with dithiocarbamate ion to yield monohapto-thioacetyl derivatives. The preparation of IrCl(CSe)(PPh3)2, the selenocarbonyl analogue of Vaska's compound is reported in Chapter 3. The synthesis utilizes carbon diselenide as the selenocarbonyl source, and involves a four-step conversion of a dihapto-carbon diselenide adduct complex to the iridium(I) selenocarbonyl species. Reactions of a range of iridium(I) complexes with carbon diselenide are described, including the preparation of a complex including three CSe2 groups. Reactions of IrCl(CSe)(PPh3)2 have been studied and several iridium(I) and (III) selenocarbonyl compounds prepared. The ready reduction of IrCl(CSe)(PPh3)2 (in the presence of phosphine) by borohydride to give IrH2(SeMe)(PPh3)3 is described and comparisons are drawn between the relative reactivities of iridium thiocarbonyl and selenocarbonyl groups, in analogous species, with nucleophiles. It is concluded the Ir-CSe system is more reactive under similar conditions. Metallocycle derivatives of iridium selenocarbonyl, diselenomethylester complexes have been characterised.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2409</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crystal studies of some organic natural products and inorganic compounds of structural interest</field><field name="creator">Brown, Kevin L.

Both of these isomers were obtained from the methoxyalkene (11), which was isolated in a pure form during selective epoxidation of the methoxyalkene mixture (11 - 13) obtained from the decarboxylation of 12-methoxypodocarpa-8,11,13-trien-19-oic acid (2) with lead tetraacetate. This reaction has been investigated, and a mechanism accounting for the formation of nondecarboxylation products is proposed. The unsaturated ketoester (102) was prepared in low yield via the saturated C12 ketone (24), obtained from 12-hydroxypodocarpa-8,11,13-trien-19-oic acid (1) by Birch reduction of the aromatic ring. A number of ring A epoxide derivatives of the acid(1) were prepared and cleaved by a variety of reagents to give the 3-oxygenated derivatives (145), (146), and (152), together with compounds possessing a contracted ring A. Some ring B lactone derivatives of the acid (1) were prepared, and their stereochemistry and conformation were determined by n.m.r. spectroscopy. The conformation of some ring B-substituted derivatives was also determined by n.m.r. methods. The bromination of some 7-ketopodocarpa-8,11,13-triene derivatives was investigated, and reasons are advanced for the non-stereospecific reactions observed in some cases.</field><field name="date">1969</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2411</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Petrological variation in the Banks Islands, New Hebrides</field><field name="creator">Barsdell, Mark</field><field name="description">The Banks Islands represent the most northern group of volcanic islands in the linear Central Chain of Pliocene - Recent age in the New Hebrides. A study o f the petrological variation in these northern islands provides a basis for the development of a petrogenetic-tectonic model which is applicable to most, if not all, the Central Chain islands. Integration of petrographic, mineralogical and geochemical data on each island in the Banks Group has revealed a systematic petrological variation across the islands, represented chemically by a decrease in K20 (and related incompatible elements) away from the New Hebrides trench. The correlation with depth to the Benioff zone is therefore the reverse of that typically found in island arcs. REE evidence and source modelling based on this data indicates that this variation represents a progressive depletion in LREE/HREE in the upper mantle, laterally away from the trench. The variation also represents a progressive increase in partial melting of the source, in the same direction. However partial melting differences alone could not produce the observed variation. The variation in source composition and degree of partial melting are blended in to a model in which the compositional variation is attributed to an earlier west-facing Miocene subduction event, and the variation in degree of partial melting is a function of the location of the islands with respect to the postulated heat source: the active back-arc basin. The enrichment of the upper mantle in the Miocene is ascribed to the ascent of hydrous fluids enriched in incompatible elements, from the west-dipping Benioff zone, and subsequent reaction with the overlying upper mantle. The model thus envisages approximately contemporaneous development of the Central Chain volcanoes and the back-arc basin in the late Pliocene, with partial melting of hydrous, laterally zoned upper mantle resulting from the convective thermal regime associated with the rifting apart of the back-arc basin. The role of the present subduction regime in magma generation is considered very limited. The mineralogical and geochemical data show that all compositions in the range from basaltic andesite to dacite (ie. &gt; 53wt.% SiO2) in the Banks Islands can be derived from basalts by fractional crystallization of the observed phenocryst phases (including magnetite in the Gaua suite), after allowances have been made for inherited differences between some melt fractions. Together with the paucity of andesites in the Central Chain, this suggests that the primary melts of the Pliocene - Recent volcanism are basaltic. The generation of calc-alkaline magmas in the early Miocene are also believed to have involved basaltic primary melts as both the Miocene Eastern and Western belts are dominantly basaltic.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2412</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Magpies: negotiations of centre and periphery in settings of New Zealand poems by New Zealand composers, 1896 to 1993</field><field name="creator">Shieff, Sarah</field><field name="description">The thesis will show that a distinctive New Zealand voice in the arts may be found not in an "essence", as has sometimes been suggested, but at chronologically specific intersections of discourses. Each of the six works I examine has been made in New Zealand and is a mixture of music and language. As generic hybrids, combinations of music and language make appropriate objects of study for a thesis that explores a specific local dialogue between the 'mixture' and the 'essence', the 'hybrid' and the 'authentic', the 'indigenous' and the 'exotic', the 'local' and the 'imported', the 'centre' and the 'periphery.' Like acquisitive magpies, New Zealand artists constantly collect and select their material. They sift, save, reject and synthesise, and in so doing they create new combinations out of old ingredients. One of the characteristics of New Zealand poetry is that it has often been combined with music. There have been many collaborations between poets and musicians since colonial times. These collaborative texts occupy a complex space between art forms, just as New Zealand artists negotiate between orientations, positioning themselves between different cultural traditions. In its own process of selection, the thesis selects six works for close analysis which represent not only different periods but also different forms of synthesis. Each work represents 'New Zealand', yet what this means in practice is different in each case.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">About turn:neural mechanisms underlying visual processing of rotated letters and digits</field><field name="creator">Milivojevic, Branka</field><field name="description">This thesis explores neural activity associated with processing of rotated alphanumeric characters, focusing particularly on linear and quadratic trend components of orientation-dependent activity. Choice of these components was driven by results of reaction-time (RT) studies; judging whether characters are normal or backward (parity task) typically elicit RTs that are linearly related to character disorientation, implying mental rotation of the characters to the upright, while judging whether they are letters or digits (categorisation task) elicits RTs related nonlinearly to disorientation, combining both linear and quadratic component, but not indicative of mental rotation. In Experiment 1 neural activity was monitored using fMRI while participants performed these tasks. In the next two experiments, neural processing was monitored with high-density EEG. In Experiment 2 participants performed the same two tasks, while in Experiment 3 they performed the category task and red-blue colour judgements. In Experiment 1, linear increases in fMRI activation were elicited only by the parity task and were observed in the posterior portion of the dorsal intraparietal sulcus and lateral and medial pre-supplementary motor areas, suggesting a fronto-parietal network underlying mental rotation. Experiment 2 showed that linear increases in parietal negativity between 350 and 710 ms only evident in the parity task, again indicating that mental rotation is only elicited by that task. Contrary to previous evidence, Experiment 2 indicated that both hemispheres may be involved in mental rotation, but rotation is faster in the right hemisphere than in the left hemisphere. Experiment 1 also showed that effects of orientation common to both tasks were best characterised by a quadratic trend, and were restricted to the supramarginal gyrus. This activation was interpreted as representing orientation-dependent shape recognition. Experiments 2 and 3 also revealed orientation-dependent neural activity at three distinct stages prior to mental rotation. First, on the P1 component, there was a difference between oblique and vertical orientations, suggesting the extraction of orientation based on axis of elongation. Next, orientation affected the N1 component, with longer latencies and larger amplitudes with misorientation, and smaller effects for inversion than for intermediate angular rotations. Finally, changes in orientation affected the P2 component differently for the parity and category tasks, probably signalling the perception of orientation relative to a parity-defined memory representation, and serving as a preparation for mental rotation. These experiments identify both the orientation-specific neural processing that occurs prior to the onset of mental rotation, and the subsequent neural correlates of mental rotation itself.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Object recognition</field><field name="subject">Spatial orientation</field><field name="subject">Mental rotation</field><field name="subject">Neural mechanisms</field><field name="subject">fMRI</field><field name="subject">EEG</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2433</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Amplitude resolution by human and ideal observers for Rayleigh noise and other Gaussian processes</field><field name="creator">Hautus, Michael J. (Michael John)</field><field name="description">The ability of human observers to discriminate aural differences in the amplitude of sinusoids, narrow-band noise, and wide-band noise was measured by the rating method of detection theory. Although each sinusoid (always 1000 Hz) was presented at a fixed amplitude, its amplitude on any trial was drawn from one of two Rayleigh probability distributions that differed in mean amplitude. Similarly, the amplitudes of the narrow-band noises were distributed as the Rayleigh distribution by virtue of the reciprocal relation between their bandwidth (100 Hz centred on 1000 Hz) and duration (10 ms). The amplitudes of the wide-band noises were distributed as chi with 82 degrees of freedom. A detection-theoretic model based on chi-square density functions was fitted to the obtained receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) and psychometric functions. The best-fitting ROCs required, on the average, 4.1 degrees of freedom for the 100-ms sinusoids and 7.3 degrees of freedom for the Rayleigh noise. The best-fitting psychometric function for both the Rayleigh noise and the sinusoids required about one degree of freedom. The results obtained for these two waveforms were not significantly different. The obtained ROCs for the wide-band noise were well fitted by the chi-square model with 82 degrees of freedom and the psychometric functions with 6.1 degrees of freedom. The best-fitting parameters for the wide- and narrow-band waveforms were significantly different. Furthermore, the performance of the observers on the nmow-band waveforms was closer to that of the corresponding ideal observer than was their performance on the wide-band waveforms. For the narrow-band noise and sinusoids, the duration of the waveform affected the variability of the best-fitting degrees of freedom for the obtained ROCs. This variability was greater for waveforms of 10-ms duration (Rayleigh noise and sinusoids) than for sinusoids of 100-ms duration; this greater variability was interpreted as stemming from the difficulty of correctly windowing short-duration waveforms. Sound pressure level had no effect on the amplitude resolution of observers for four different levels of Rayleigh noise and of sinusoids. Therefore Weber's Law, and not the near miss to Weber's Law, holds for these waveforms. The chi-square detection-theoretic model provided a good fit to the data from all experiments, but not as good as predicted by statistical theory. It was concluded that the chi-square model provides a close approximation to the underlying mechanisms involved in the amplitude resolution of Gaussian noise processes.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2417</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supply chain (re)alignment in New Zealand&#8217;s sheep meat and dairy industries : knowledge, networks and learning at the farmer-processor site</field><field name="creator">Penny, G. M.</field><field name="description">Emerging from the agricultural crisis of the 1988s, producers and processing companies in New Zealand's sheep meat and dairy industries, found themselves in an evolving neo-liberalised environment. By the late 1990s major structural (re) alignment had taken place in production and processing to accommodate shifts in markets and regulation, centring on 'food safety', 'quality' and "availability" For both farmers and processing company staff, this meant venturing into unfamiliar jointly occupied spaces and unchartered relational territory, Through a participatory research approach using multiple methodologies, this thesis examines supply chain (re)alignment at a macro and micro-scale, focussing on the farmer-processor relationship and knowledge, network and learning processes of farmers in (global) lamb and dairy supply chains in New Zealand. In seeking to account for evolving agri-food chain relations at multiple scales, this research turns to the global commodity chains (GCC) literature and draws on pragmatic solution-oriented ideas emerging from the developing field of Supply Chain Management (SCM). It also includes theoretical input from the cognitive and behavioural sciences to interpret the empirical data on farmer's knowledge, networks and learning in different supply chains, which it argues are key features of globalising agri-food economies. In this research these literatures and theories are enveloped by a broader yet, incomplete, theoretical foundation - that of evolutionary political economy (EPE), which is extended in this thesis, The thesis argues that an EPE framework provides a useful window on the governance of New Zealand's relations at a distance because it allows the specificity of micro-scale coordination activities and relations (in jointly occupied spaces) in New Zealand to be embedded in local and macro scale governance regimes and historical development processes. The findings show global market and regulatory pressures continue to drive supply chain (re)alignment in New Zealand, and chain building is occurring in different ways at the farmer-processor interface, between and within the different industries. Farmers' place specific on-farm knowledge co-evolves with off-farm knowledge through a combination of concrete experience, trial and error, socialisation and reflection, with both on and off farm knowledge becoming more overt in practice and strategy as supply chain specifications becomes more precise. Farmers utilise a range of networks (informal, formal, specialist and general), which serve as both information channels and learning forums. New Zealand's agricultural industries are like many in competitive globalising economies -'new' know ledge is being generated and used to broker global and local social, economic and environmental contexts and values, and in the process, supply chain partners' capacities and relations evolve.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2418</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adolescent gambling in New Zealand: an exploration of protective and risk factors</field><field name="creator">Rossen, Fiona</field><field name="description">Despite a growing appreciation in New Zealand of the harms arising from gambling, there remains a lack of knowledge and awareness of the dangers associated with participation in gambling by young people. Although international research has demonstrated that young people are a high-risk group with regard to problem gambling, research in New Zealand has only investigated the gambling behaviour of those aged 18 and over. This thesis explores a topic that has been largely neglected within New Zealand: the relevance of gambling and problem gambling for New Zealand adolescents. A questionnaire consisting of both standardised and non-standardised items, was administered to a random sample of more than 2000 secondary school students in the Upper North Island. The role of gambling in adolescent life, the prevalence of adolescent problem gambling, and associated risk factors were investigated. This research also adopted a largely unique perspective within the youth gambling field, extending investigations to include the role of protective factors, particularly social connectedness. This investigation of protective factors supports strengths-based approaches to youth behavioural issues, with the potential to aid in the prevention or minimisation of harm, as opposed to approaches that focus upon responding to problems, as is encouraged by dysfunction-based models. This research demonstrates that gambling is part of youth culture in New Zealand. It provides the first body of data detailing the practices, beliefs, and other factors associated with adolescent gambling behaviour within New Zealand. The findings indicate that choices around gambling are strongly influenced by contextual factors and that young New Zealander&#8217;s participate in a wide variety of gambling modes. While most gamble safely, approximately four percent were observed to satisfy the problem gambling criteria. Social connectedness was strongly correlated to problem gambling behaviour and the research points towards the investigation of protective factors, resiliency, and strengths-based strategies in the future. The continuing exploration of common denominators between gambling and other dangerous consumptions also offer promising avenues for future research within the gambling field. This research demonstrates that youth gambling is an issue requiring the attention of families, communities, schools, researchers, government departments, and members of the gambling industries.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2611</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Utilization of diterpenoids in synthesis</field><field name="creator">Palmer, Brian D.</field><field name="description">The first part of this thesis describes the use of several diterpenoids which are readily available in New Zealand for the synthesis of compounds possessing ambergris-type odours.

Evaluation was made in three ways: 1) Observation of large-scale geographic variation in nitrogen status in natural populations around New Zealand in summer and winter, 2) Laboratory-based experimental assessment of the biochemical responses of N-indices in Ulva to nitrogen enrichment, and 3) Culturing standardized test-Ulva under low nutrient conditions which could be deployed into a variety of field situations. Seawater inorganic nutrient (nitrate, nitrite, ammonium and phosphate) concentrations and nitrogen (N)-indices (free amino acids, chlorophyll and total tissue nitrogen) in natural Ulva populations from 32 sites around New Zealand were compared. Sites were divided into 6 environmental categories: sheltered rural, exposed rural, rock pools, sheltered urban, exposed urban, and nitrogen-enriched urban sites. Seawater nutrient concentrations were highly variable between all sites in summer and winter. However, in the summer enriched urban sites had the highest mean total inorganic nitrogen concentrations and Ulva with the highest mean levels of all N-indices compared with any other environmental category. In the winter, Ulva contained more nitrogen (reflected in all N-indices) compared with Ulva in the summer, particularly in populations growing in colder southern seawater on more exposed coasts. The increase in Ulva N-status was not explained by increased seawater inorganic nitrogen concentrations. With univariate and multivariate statistical approaches it was shown that there was a significant effect of seawater temperature and site exposure on N-status in Ulva. Compared with other N-indices, stable nitrogen isotopes (&#948;15N) from Ulva growing in enriched urban sites had the widest range (4.77 &#177; 0.04 &#8240; to 15.16 &#177; 0.03 &#8240;) of values compared with all other categories in both summer and winter. Conversely, Ulva from exposed rural sites had the lowest range of &#948;15N values compared with any other category (6.7 &#177; 0.1 to 8.8 &#177; 0.1 &#8240;) and showed no seasonal change in mean values (7.8 &#8240; and 7.6 &#8240; for summer and winter, respectively). In addition, &#948;15N values in Ulva were the only N-index that showed a significant difference between urban and rural categories. To test the relationship between inorganic nitrogen concentration in seawater and the responses of biochemical nitrogen indices in Ulva pertusa, several experiments were conducted in an outdoor, flow-through culture apparatus, in summer and winter. In this apparatus effects of ammonium concentration, nitrogen source (nitrate and ammonium), light and seawater motion were investigated. Of the same three N-indices examined in natural Ulva populations (free amino acids, chlorophyll and total tissue nitrogen), increases in free amino acids, particularly asparagine, provided the strongest indicator of increases in nitrogen availability. In addition, while tissue nitrogen and chlorophyll also increased with seawater nitrogen concentration, it was apparent that these indices were also strongly influenced by light, and probably season. Rates of ammonium assimilation provided no overall measure of the availability of nitrogen in seawater and were clearly affected by season. Similarly, growth rates in Ulva only showed a response to nitrogen addition in summer months. Stable isotopes of nitrogen (&#948;15N) in Ulva provided a clear distinction between natural and synthetic nitrogen sources, but more importantly, showed only minor fractionation (ranging from 1.3 &#8240; to -1.9 &#8240;) of 15N supplied from synthetic nitrate and ammonium under both light-saturating and light-limiting conditions. To further develop Ulva as a standardized test-organism it was cultured in low-nutrient (non-polluted) seawater to deplete internal storage pools of nitrogen. Each month the resulting test-Ulva was then placed in surface-moored growth enclosures at a range of coastal sites around Auckland and then monitored for one year. In winter there were increases in seawater inorganic nitrogen concentrations and concomitant increases in free amino acid content. However, tissue nitrogen and chlorophyll content in test-Ulva showed similar increases (possibly saturating) across all sites suggesting that seasonal increases in these N-indices were also due to other seasonal factors (e.g., surface irradiance and / or seawater temperature). On the other hand, the total free amino acid pool showed strong differences between a low-nitrogen reference site and the other study sites all year round. It was probable that test-Ulva was integrating differences in tidally-averaged nitrogen loading that were not reliably detected in instantaneous seawater samples. In addition to N-indices in test-Ulva, levels of tissue heavy metals and stable isotopes of nitrogen showed strong differences with higher values of both typically found in urban environments compared with values found in non-polluted reference sites. It is concluded that several abiotic and biotic factors affect nitrogen status in Ulva, but the average nitrogen concentration in seawater, and the physical factors of temperature, light and water motion, appear to be the overarching determinants. It is further suggested that in combination with Ulva tissue &#948;15N values, tissue nitrogen and the free amino acid pool, as quantitative biochemical measures of nitrogen availability, are likely to provide useful information on both the amount and composition of nitrogen entering coastal environments.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ulva</field><field name="subject">algae</field><field name="subject">seaweed</field><field name="subject">nutrients</field><field name="subject">eutrophication</field><field name="subject">seawater nitrogen enrichment</field><field name="subject">nitrogen metabolism</field><field name="subject">biological indicator</field><field name="subject">free amino acids</field><field name="subject">tissue nitrogen</field><field name="subject">chlorophyll</field><field name="subject">isotope d15N</field><field name="subject">seawater temperature</field><field name="subject">water motion</field><field name="subject">marine pollution</field><field name="subject">heavy metals</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::279900 Other Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2522</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of copper systems interacting with molecular oxygen</field><field name="creator">Oliver, Kenneth John</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the chemical, physico-chemical and structural studies of two types of copper compounds which interact with molecular oxygen in their formation. The first type is an intensely coloured species based on the ligand oxalyldihydrazide. The divalent metal and the ligand react together with simple carbonyl compounds and molecular oxygen in basic conditions to form blue species the nature of which has been the subject of conjecture for many years. This work shows that the metal is trivalent in the highly coloured states and that it acts as an oxidative catalyst with ascorbic acid. The copper (III)/copper (II) potential has been established as +0.244V by polarography. Compounds including acetaldehyde and acetone as the carbonyl component have been crystallized in monoclinic space groups. In both instances X-ray diffraction studies show that the metal is co-ordinated to a 6-5-6-5 macrocycle formed by a condensation reaction between two oxalyldihydrazide molecules and two carbonyl moieties. The co-ordination is via four deprotonated 'amide' nitrogen atoms and is of square-planar geometry. A structural study of oxalyldihydrazide has also been undertaken and comparisons are made with the co-ordinated species. The second type of compound studied is a Cu4OX6L4 cluster. It was made from a copper(I) precursor and studies with oxygen-18 gas show that formation requires oxidation to copper(II) followed by hydrolysis. Infrared evidence based on the Cu-O stretch (500-580 cm-1) is presented. Attempts to include both fluorine and iodine as the halogen component suggest that only chlorine and bromine may fill such a role.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2425</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Continuity and change in a hospital ward : an open systems analysis</field><field name="creator">McMorland, Judith Ceridwen Irangani</field><field name="description">Using a voluntaristic theory of action and Buckley&#8217;s (1967) paradigm of complex adaptive systems, explanation of the process of change in organisations is attempted. The specific question addressed is why some changes, rather than others, are incorporated into organisational arrangements. This thesis has three parts. The first is a theoretical statement of Buckley&#8217;s model and an argument for the extension of this scheme in two important respects. The second is an extended case study of a psychiatric ward of a general hospital to which the model is applied. The third is a theoretical re-statement of the original paradigm in the light of this application. Buckley&#8217;s model was used to identify: 1.	The external and internal variety which may affect an organisation 2.	The tension-producing factors within the organisational arrangement which constrain actor&#8217;s choice of response to variety 3.	The processes whereby actors selectively map responses to variety 4.	The processes for the transmission and perpetuation of stable accommodations to variety. Two adaptations were made initially to Buckley&#8217;s scheme. To explain more fully the process of &#8216;mapping&#8217; ((3) above), two constructs are proposed, derived from the concept of the phenomenal &#8216;self&#8217;. These are &#8216;meaning system&#8217; and &#8216;dramatic repertoire of self-presentation&#8217;. Inclusion of Koestlers&#8217; (1967) concept of the open-ended hierarchy of awareness is suggested as a theoretical solution to the problem of homeostasis ((4) above) in systems of action. Argument for the use of an open systems approach in general, and Buckley&#8217;s paradigm in particular, together with the proposed amendments of Buckley&#8217;s scheme is presented in Chapters I and II. The case study is presented in Chapters III-VIII. Chapter III is a review of the historical factors which provide the context for the study, while changes occurring in the nursing, medical and non-medical sub-systems are discussed in turn, in Chapters, IV, V and VI respectively. Chapter VII identifies four scenes of social encounter in the ward and discusses the process of interaction occurring in each. Chapter VIII is an epilogue which examines briefly the outcome of events mentioned in the earlier chapters. Chapter IX is a statement of the conclusions drawn from the case study. The value of Buckley&#8217;s paradigm in the construction of an extended case study is demonstrated and the importance of the concepts of &#8216;mapping&#8217; and &#8216;perpetuation&#8217; is highlighted because they permit explanation of macrosocial processes which remain fully within the social context and point to the importance of identifying the dramatisation of power in social encounters. The initial harnessing of action theory and systems theory concepts was found to be too limited. A theoretical solution is, therefore, proposed in Chapter X which is capable of explaining system elaboration in the two dimensions of &#8216;organisation&#8217; and &#8216;self&#8217;. The model takes into account the dialectic tensions existing between &#8216;self/organisation&#8217; and &#8216;stability/change&#8217;, and differentiates between evolutionary and revolutionary change, making explicit both the constitutive processes of interaction and the interplay of forces affecting the individual and social order.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2426</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of pistis and cognate words in the Apostolic Fathers</field><field name="creator">Gilmour, Thomas Calum</field><field name="description">The Apostolic Fathers is the name given to the body of literature, written in Greek, which dates from immediately after the New Testament period. The works cover the last decade of the 1st century AD, and the first half of the second century. They give a varied picture of the moral and doctrinal state of the early Christian Church in a period characterised by constant threat of persecution and martyrdom on the one hand, and growth in theological and ethical understanding on the other. The works considered in this thesis are the genuine letters of Ignatius; the Shepherd of Hermas; the Epistle of Barnabas and the Didache; the letter to Diognetus; the Clementine Homily (commonly called II Clement); the letters of Polycarp to the Philippians and the Martyrdom of Polycarp. The study begins with an essay on the development of the language of faith. This traces the use of the pistis group from Homer to the New Testament, and shows how the Homeric and Classical Greek usages were taken by the Septuagint and applied in a religious context to God and salvation, and how this process was further developed in the New Testament into a full-blown technical vocabulary of faith. The Apostolic Fathers take this process a step further, and there is a broadening of the meanings of the cognates, together with resultant changes in the linguistic usage. All the occurrences of pistis and its cognates in the Apostolic Fathers are examined in detail. In each case there is comment of the meaning of the words within the wider context in which they are set in each work. The Greek is given, together with a translation, and obscure passages are elucidated.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420107 Greek</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2428</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Responses of Cucurbita pepo and Cucurbita maxima to ethrel</field><field name="creator">Hume, Robert James</field><field name="description">Many commercial crops of Cucurbita maxima and C. pepo are grown from Fl hybrid seed in New Zealand. Conventional methods of Fl seed production are labour intensive and expensive. Applying Ethrel sprays at 300ppm at the two and four leaf stage to the seed bearing parent delayed male flowering for sufficient time to allow insect pollination and eliminate 90% of the labour previously needed. After field trials the technique was used on a commercial scale. A satisfactory yield of pure Fl seed with a high germination percentage was produced. The variation between cultivars in response to Ethrel means that each one must be tested. It is shown that the degree and type of epinasty of pot plants sprayed with Ethrel can be used to determine the appropriate concentrations for field trials of C. pepo. The increase in female flower numbers, the shift in position of these flowers on the mainstem and the suppression of male flower numbers is brought about by two mechanisms. Ethrel sprays caused male flower bud abortion and an increase in the number of female flowers developing. More than one flower bud is borne in each leaf axil and if male, the bud aborts and can be replaced by a subsidiary undifferentiated bud which develops as a female. At the two to four leaf stage of plant development and shortly afterwards a large number of flower buds are developing to the stage of sexual differentiation. Spraying with Ethrel at these time is very effective in influencing sex expression. The release of ethylene by Ethrel breakdown continues for several days and the continuous exposure to ethylene is another reason for Ethrel&#8217;s effectiveness. The time course of ethylene release from aqueous Ethrel solutions was determined in some physical systems as well as from cotyledon and leaf surface contact. Some ethylene was released when Ethrel was applied to soil. When Ethrel was dried on surfaces or in soil its breakdown was much reduced, but on rewetting proceeded again. Spraying only one leaf with Ethrel still caused responses from other parts of the plant indicating transmission of a stimulus. This was not caused by aerial diffusion from the sprayed leaf. Although several effects of ethylene were studied major emphasis was placed on epinasty, stimulation of endogenous ethylene and its distribution between plant parts, the abortion of male flowers and the induction of female flowers. When aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) was applied with Ethrel, the plants show epinastic responses and male flower abortion but not female flower induction, endogenous ethylene production or transfer of stimuli of Ethrel effects within the plant. Ethylene gas was similarly ineffective on plants treated with AVG. Ethylenebiodynthesis is blocked at the stage producing aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) the immediate precursor of ethylene. Assays showed ACC to be below detectable levels in AVG treated plants. Ethrel alone caused high levels of ACC and ACC was found in high levels in plant apices if leaf one was sprayed with Ethrel. ACC is mobile in plants and a firm correlation is shown between female flower bud production and the presence of ACC. It was concluded the ethylene released from Ethrel sprays caused epinasty and male flower bud abortion as well as promoting endogenous ethylene production via ACC. Ethrel sprays release ethylene in sufficient quantity for long enough for very high levels of ACC to be produced and ACC is transported throughout the plant, but preferentially to metabolic sinks, e.g. the plant apices, where embryonic buds respond by developing as female flower buds. Increased ethylene levels were also recorded at these sites. Because ACC has been shown to cause a plant response formerly attributed to ethylene it is now essential to investigate the whole spectrum of &#8216;ethylene&#8217; effects in plants.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2430</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the reduction of formaldehyde emission from particleboard by polymers</field><field name="creator">Kazakevics, Arnis Aris Rolands.</field><field name="description">Formaldehyde is an important industrial chemical due to its unique properties, coupled with its low cost and the basic availability of the raw materials from which it is produced. It is generated principally by the catalytic oxidation of methanol using a heated stationary catalyst at approximately atmospheric pressure. Formaldehyde is used in the manufacture of a wide variety of commercial products, the most significant of which in New Zealand, are the urea-formaldehyde resins. Such resins are used in the production of reconstituted wood products such as: particleboard; medium density fibreboard; plywood; laminated and finger jointed wood products; and in the modification of textiles and papers. Insulating building foams have also been formulated using urea-formaldehyde resins. Formaldehyde release from products containing urea-formaldehyde adhesives has been well documented in the literature over recent years. It has been shown that in some instances the levels of airborne formaldehyde inside dwellings and commercial premises may exceed various industrial threshold limit values for an eight hour working day. In New Zealand the current industrial permissible time weighted average value for formaldehyde in air is set at a maximum level of 2 ppm (2.4 mg of formaldehyde per metre3 of air). Natural levels of formaldehyde in air do exist and have been measured as being in the vicinity of 0.12 to 0.39 parts per billion. In terms of being a health hazard, formaldehyde was found to be a primary irritant of the respiratory airways and a skin sensitizer in some individuals. Some suggestion has been made that formaldehyde can also be carcinogenic. This suggestion should be treated with caution as it derives from preliminary experiments on rats and mice exposed to very high formaldehyde levels. Over the years a variety of test methods have been applied to the measurement of formaldehyde which is released from formaldehyde-bearing materials. A dynamic testing method, in the form of a wind-tunnel was adopted in this study for measuring the emission rate of formaldehyde directly from the surfaces of urea-formaldehyde bonded particleboard. Emissions were quantified in terms of the weight of formaldehyde emitted in mg from one square metre of panel surface over one hour, under the prevailing climatic conditions. It was observed that formaldehyde emissions were as great as about 12 mg h-1 m-2 from panels tested soon after manufacture. After five years of storage of the particleboard panels in ventilated conditions, the formaldehyde emission rates were measured as being between 0.1 and 1.1 mg h-1 m-2. It was apparent that formaldehyde emissions from particleboard bonded with a urea-formaldehyde resin with a urea to formaldehyde molar ratio of 1 to 1.5, reached a basal level approximately 12 months from the time of manufacture. The formaldehyde emitted over the initial 12 month period was equated to the formaldehyde which was originally present dissolved in the resin solution and the formaldehyde which was cleaved from the urea-formaldehyde polymer network during high temperature pressing. Formaldehyde lost from the particleboard after the initial 12 month storage phase was probably due to hydrolysis of the resin under ambient conditions. The latter was termed "evaporable" formaldehyde as opposed to "free" formaldehyde which was emitted in the first 12 month period. The fluctuations in the basal emission rates of formaldehyde from particleboard were attributed to changes in the microclimate associated with the particleboard. Particleboard panels with a higher density surface layer of wood tended to have higher formaldehyde emission rates in the early period of storage compared with particleboard having a lower density of wood in the surface layer. Emissions of formaldehyde from the edges of freshly sawn particleboard tended to be as much as 30 to 60 times greater than emissions from the faces of the original panels. After extended storage, emissions from the edges of particleboard tended to approximate the levels of emissions from the faces of particleboard. It was demonstrated that the presence of an air boundary layer adjacent to the particleboard surface has a significant effect on the formaldehyde emission rate from the panel surface. Below air speeds of 5 cm s-1 over the panel surface, it appeared that the rate of diffusion of formaldehyde through the air boundary layer controlled the rate of diffusion of formaldehyde from the particleboard surface into the bulk air. At air velocities in excess of 5 am s-1 the effect of the air boundary layer diminished. It was estimated that within enclosed spaces, such as houses with a relatively low air-turnover rate, the diffusive resistance of air boundary layers to formaldehyde emissions from particleboard surfaces could be significant in lowering the formaldehyde levels inside the house. The use of paints, paint-coated wallpaper and polymer-coated wallpaper to cover particleboard surfaces tended to reduce the emission rate of formaldehyde to below the detection threshold of the method of measurement (0.01 mg h-1 m-2). Some building materials other than urea-formaldehyde bonded particleboard were shown to emit measureable quantities of formaldehyde. These materials were of cellulosic-origin and emitted as much as 0.3 mg of formaldehyde h-1 m-2. The latter were known to not contain urea-fonnal6ehyde bonding agents. The levels of formaldehyde inside a showhome containing urea-formaldehyde bonded particleboard as wall and floor cladding were measured as ranging from 1.2 to 7.2 mg m-3, but these air-borne concentrations of formaldehyde decreased to between 0.7 and 1.3 mg m-3. after an interval of three months. A mathematical model was derived for the prediction of the maximum expected steady state levels of formaldehyde inside dwellings containing formaldehyde-emitting materials. The model took into account such parameters as: the emission rate of formaldehyde from the emitting surface; the surface area of the exposed emitting material; and the volumetric air flow rate through the dwelling. The model in general tended to indicate higher formaldehyde levels when tested using the parameters derived from measurements taken in the showhome. This model could conceivably find use in the design of buildings in order to minimize the levels of formaldehyde in the indoor environment. The lack of sufficient information in the literature relating to the mass transfer of formaldehyde through polymers prompted the investigation into the permeability characteristics of polymeric materials to formaldehyde. The steady state transmission rates of formaldehyde through free polymer films, such as plastic films, free paint and free polyurethane varnish coatings, were measured using a diffusion cell operated at atmospheric pressure. The mass diffusion principle associated with this permeation testing device best paralleled the real-life situation where either polymer films (plastic films) or polymer coatings (paint or varnish coatings) may be in contact with formaldehyde and water vapour, at atmospheric pressure. As a source of penetrant in these studies a dilute aqueous solution of formaldehyde was used to yield molecular formaldehyde. It was calculated that an aqueous solution containing 69 mg L-1 of formaldehyde gave rise to a concentration in air of formaldehyde, above the solution, of 1 mg m-3 at 30&#176;C. A solution with such a concentration of dissolved formaldehyde was chosen arbitrarily for permeation studies. Levels of air-borne formaldehyde inside enclosed airspaces such as in houses lined with urea-formaldehyde bonded particleboard, with a low air turn-over, could reasonably be expected to be in the region of 0.1 to 100 mg m-3. The use of carbon-14 formaldehyde was favoured in this research over the use of carbon-12 formaldehyde. This gave rise to the possibility of permeability isotope effects. Based on the information presented in this thesis and on the experimental variability in test results, it appeared that the effects of a permeability isotope effect were negligible in comparison. The transmission rates of formaldehyde through the following types of polymer films were measured: low density polyethylene; high density polyethylene; high density-low density polyethylene blended polymer; polypropylene; poly(ethy1ene terephthalate); poly(viny1idene dichloride)-coated Poly(ethy1ene terephthalate); "Paraform", a multi-layered food packaging polymer film based on cellophane; Poly(ethylene vinyl acetate), a multi-layered food packaging polymer film; plasticised poly(vinyl chloride); polystyrene; nylon-6; and cellophane. At 30&#176;C transmission rates of formaldehyde ranged from 1.2 x 10-7 &#956;g cm-1 s-1 for cellophane to 1.2 x 10-l2 &#956;g cm-1 s-1 for poly (ethylene vinyl acetate) polymer films, respectively. There was some indication that the transmission rate of formaldehyde through low density polyethylene decreased with increasing film thickness. It also appeared that an increase in the water contents of nylon-6 and cellophane films lead to an increase in the transmission rate of formaldehyde. With the exception of the poly(ethylene terephthalate)-types of polymer films and the polystyrene film, all other polymer film types exhibited typical Fickian behaviour, in that the permeation of formaldehyde through each polymer film was steady state. The permeation of formaldehyde through poly (ethylene terephtha1ate)-type films and polystyrene film appeared to be anomalous in that the mass transfer process did not appear to show Fickian-type behaviour. The transmission rates of formaldehyde through free alkyd-type paint films, free vinyl-based paint films and through free polyurethane varnish films, were measured at 30&#176;C. The permeation of formaldehyde through free alkyd-type paint films and free polyurethane varnish films typified Fickian behaviour, in that after a short time-lag the steady state permeation of formaldehyde occurred. The transmission rates of formaldehyde through the free alkyd-types of paint film ranged from 1.8 x 10-9 &#956;g cm-1s-1 to 3 2 x l0-9 &#956;g cm-1 s-1 whereas transmission rates of formaldehyde through free polyurethane varnish films ranged from 4.1 x 10-10 &#956;g cm-1 s-1 to 2.4 x 10-8 &#956;g cm-1 s-1. It appeared that the "two-pack" or "catalytic-curing" type of polyurethane varnish film had a lower permeability to formaldehyde compared with either "one-pack" ("air-curing") or "one-pack" ("moisture-curing") varieties of polyurethane varnish. By contrast the transmission rates of formaldehyde through the vinyl-based types of paint films tended to range from 3.7 x 10-7 &#956;g cm-1 s-1 to 6.2 x10-7 &#956;g cm-1 s-1. A study of the temperature dependency of the permeation of formaldehyde through the following polymer film types was made: low density polyethylene; plasticised poly(vinyl chloride); polystyrene; polypropylene; high density polyethylene; cellophane; and nylon-6. The transmission rates of formaldehyde through each of these polymer film types increased with increasing temperature, over the temperature range of 30&#176;C to 50&#176;C, thus typifying Arrhenius behaviour. The energies of activation for the permeation of formaldehyde were calculated as ranging from 16 1 kcal mol-1 (67.4 kJ mol-1) for plasticised poly (vinyl chloride) to 33.1 kcal mol-1 (139 kJ mol-1 for cellophane, respectively. These activation energies were in general higher than the energies of activation for the permeation of other penetrants of similar molecular weight, through the same polymer types. The observed energies of activation for the permeation of formaldehyde through polymers were indicative of a strong interaction between formaldehyde and the various polymers. Desorption studies of formaldehyde from polymer films tested after permeability measurement, indicated that formaldehyde was irreversibly sorbed either onto or into the following polymer film types: low density polyethylene; poly(ethy1ene vinyl acetate); polypropylene; polystyrene; and plasticised poly(vinyl chloride). Formaldehyde was found to desorb from nylon-6 and cellophane polymer film types, indicating a different type of interaction between formaldehyde and these two polymer film types. The autoradiography of polymer films and free polymer coatings following permeability testing showed that the pattern of sorbed carbon-14 formaldehyde exhibited by each polymer film type or free polymer coating type, differed according to the type of polymer. Clustering of sorbed carbon-14 formaldehyde in polymer films containing polyethylene polymers may have been indicative of the formation of formaldehyde-formaldehyde polymers or perhaps could have been due to preferred pathways or sites for the diffusion of formaldehyde through the polymer film. The following types of polymer film tended to show a uniform sorption pattern of formaldehyde: nylon-6; cellophane; "Paraform"; free alkyd paint films; free vinyl-based paint films; and free polyurethane varnish films. The uniform appearance of the sorption pattern of carbon-14 formaldehyde may have been indicative of a higher solubility coefficient of permeation for formaldehyde in the latter polymer types. On the other hand, insufficient carbon-14 formaldehyde was sorbed by the poly(ethylene terephthalatel-type and polystyrene films in order to obtain autoradiographs. Both the poly(ethylene terephthalate)-types of films and the polystyrene film had a relatively low permeability to formaldehyde and appeared to also have a low solubilizing effect on formaldehyde. The data presented in this thesis are discussed in relation to the practical problem that initiated the study. Sufficient detailed information has been collected to enable informed decisions to be taken over the choice of formaldehyde-emitting materials used in the building and the food packaging industries.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2432</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Independens long Vanuatu: the churches and politics in a Melanesian nation</field><field name="creator">Myers, Michael David</field><field name="description">In this dissertation I examine the relationship between the churches and politics in Vanuatu, focusing in particular on the role of the Christian churches in the independence movement of the 1970s. I also look at the political involvement of the churches in the two years immediately following national independence. The dissertation is based on fieldwork in Vanuatu from April 1981 to June 1982. In Chapter I, I introduce and defend my national, institutional perspective on the churches. In Chapter II, I discuss the history of Vanuatu, focusing specifically on the history of the missions up to the end of the 1960s. Chapter III looks at the independence movement and recent political history. In Chapter IV I examine the relationship between the churches and politics in two contrasting rural areas: at the Catholic mission station of Walarano, Malakula, and at the Presbyterian area of White Sands, Tanna. Chapter V is concerned with the ecumenical movement in the Pacific and looks at the support of the Pacific churches for the independence movement in Vanuatu. Chapters VI to X are parallel histories of the same period. They all look at the involvement of the churches in Vanuatu politics from about the beginning of the 1970s - when the independence movement began - up to national independence on 30 July 1980. However, each chapter is written from a different perspective. Chapter VI documents the political involvement of the Presbyterian Church; Chapter VII is concerned with Bishop Raweliffe and the politics of Anglicanism; Chapter VIII looks at the political role of the Roman Catholic Church in Vanuatu; Chapter IX focuses mostly on the relationship between the Churches of Christ and Nagriamel; and Chapter X takes a look at the ecumenical movement in Vanuatu and the origins and development of the New Hebrides Christian Council. In Chapter XI I examine the post-independence developments in all the major churches. Chapter XII concludes with a discussion of three issues: localisation, independence and unity, both in the churches and in the nation.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies::430103 History: Pacific</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2435</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Degradation and utilisation of mucins by anaerobic bacteria from the colon</field><field name="creator">Stanley, Roger Anthony</field><field name="description">Intestinal mucins are high-molecular-weight complex glycoproteins which are thought to be fermented by the anaerobic bacteria in the colon. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the mode and extent of mucin degradation by bacteria. A method was developed to isolate gram quantities of soluble pig colonic mucin and pig gastric mucin. These preparations, along with commercially available pig gastric mucin, were incorporated into bacterial growth media as the sole carbohydrate energy sources. The molecular size and chemical composition of these mucins was determined before and after in vitro digestion by bacteria. Three different studies were done. In the first, type cultures of Bacteroides fragilis were found to be capable of growing on gastric and colonic mucins by cleaving residues from the non-reducing ends of the mucin oligosaccharide chains. Mucin degradation, however, was limited to the removal of only a few residues although this may be significant in vivo as bacteria in the gut lumen must be able to utilise many different complex polysaccharides and thus do not specialise in degrading any one substrate. In the second experiment, bacteria were isolated from the mucus layer of the pig colon. Three of the cultures studied extensively degraded mucins but colonic mucin was always more resistant to attack than the gastric mucins. Up to 80 mol% of the gastric mucin carbohydrates were cleaved and utilised. In contrast these bacteria utilised no more than 46 mol% of the colonic mucin carbohydrates. In the third study, fresh rat faecal material was used to inoculate bacterial media containing either colonic mucin or commercial gastric mucin. The faecal bacteria had completely degraded the gastric mucin after 24 h incubation but 36 h incubation was required to degrade the colonic mucin. However, when bacteria from the colonic mucin tubes were subcultured into fresh colonic mucin it was completely fermented after 24h incubation. It is hypothesis that, although the chemical compositions were similar, colonic mucin contained bonds that were not present in the gastric mucin. Evidence for this was obtained by assaying the mucins using the histochemical periodic acid/Schiff and Alcian blue stains. The Alcian blue reactivity was more conserved than PAS staining during bacterial hydrolysis. Therefore hydrolysis of these Alcian blue reactive groups may be the rate-limiting step in colonic mucin degradation. The molecular basis of the PAS and Alcian blue stains was investigated. PAS stain (0.01% periodic acid) was found to react with terminal neuraminic acid, fucose and possibly galactose residues but not with hexosamine residues. Alcian blue stain bound mainly to sulphate esters but could not be correlated with total sulphate content. When both these colorimetric Alcian blue and PAS stains were use together they provided a valuable tool for assaying the results of chromatography runs. Gastric mucin was show to be composed of separate neutral (Alcian blue negative) and acidic (Alcian blue positive) glycoproteins. Colonic mucin contained only acidic glycoproteins.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2434</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PulA, a thermostable pullulanase from an extreme thermophile Caldocellum saccharolyticum</field><field name="creator">Albertson, Gregory David</field><field name="description">The pullulanase gene from Caldocellum saccharolyticum, an obligate thermophilic anaerobe, was sequenced and expressed in E. coli. Expression and substrate induction studies in E. coli showed that while gene expression was substrate inducible and the enzyme was exported into the growth medium in C. saccharolyticum, expression was non-inducible in E. coli and the enzyme remained in the cytoplasm. The nucleotide sequence of the pulA gene was shown to be 2478 basepairs (bp) in length, coding for a protein of 96 kDa. The proposed promoter sequences showed homology to both the standard E. coli sequences and the consensus sequences obtained from other C. saccharolyticum genes. The enzyme from the native organism was purified from the growth medium and shown to have a molecular mass of approximately 120 kDa. Periodic acid-Schiffs staining showed that this enzyme was glycosylated and substrate characterisation revealed that the enzyme debranched pullulan to produce only maltotriose, but hydrolysed amylopectin, amylose and &#946;-limit dextran to produce a number of smaller oligosaccharides. The enzyme was expressed in E. coli from its own promoters and was purified from the cytoplasmic fraction. Substrate characterisation revealed that the enzyme debranched pullulan to produce only maltotriose, but had only limited activity on &#946;-limit dextran and amylopectin, and no activity on amylose. The pullulanase gene was also expressed under the control of a heat-inducible overexpression system in E. coli and a copper-inducible expression system in yeast. Amino acid homology comparisons of the pullulanase to other pullulanase sequences and related enzymes revealed a high degree of homology, particularly around three highly conserved regions. In &#945;-amylases amino acids in these regions are involved in catalytic activity, substrate binding and metal ion binding.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2436</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social Credit, an analysis of New Zealand&#8217;s perennial third party</field><field name="creator">Miller, Raymond, 1953-</field><field name="description">The main purpose of this thesis is to provide a history and political analysis of the organisation, policies, membership and leadership of the Social Credit party between 1953 and 1986. The introductory chapter describes the methodology and reviews the literature on third parties in general and Social Credit in particular. Chapter Two provides a prelude to the formation of the Social Credit Political League in 1953. It traces the movement's decline as an education and pressure group under the first Labour Government. Chapter Three examines the debate surrounding the decision t o engage in direct political action and describes the process by which the Political League was formed. Chapter Four considers the reasons for and the findings of the Royal Commission on Monetary, Banking and Credit Systems (1956) and accounts for the growing internal debate culminating in the removal of Mr Wilfrid Owen as Leader in 1959. In Chapter Five the impact on the party of Mr Vernon Cracknell's victory in Hobson in 1966 is considered, along with an assessment of his role in Parliament as the sole third party representative. The reasons for his defeat at the 1969 general election and replacement as Leader some six months later are investigated, and Chapter Six is devoted to the brief but stormy experiment with Mr John O'Brien as Leader, followed by his split from the League in 1972 and the formation of the New Democrat Party. The early Beetham years, including attempts to revise the party's monetary reform dogma, broaden the scope of its message, and to give it a more professional organisation are considered in Chapter Seven. I n Chapter Eight the reasons for and the internal consequences of the party's rapid rise in popularity from early 1978 and its decline after March 1981 are analysed. The chapter ends with an account of Mr Beetham's defeat as Leader in 1986. The thesis concludes that Social Credit's history as an electoral organisation has been conspicuously cyclical, that its progress has been regulated largely by the electoral performances of the two major parties and by the presence or absence of minor party competition, that its leadership has been distinctly oligarchic, and that Social Credit has not been one, but several different parties. Why has the party not been more successful? And why has it lasted so long? These questions are addressed in the final chapter.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2437</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Facilitating independent learning early in the first year of school</field><field name="creator">Watson, Barbara</field><field name="description">This is a study of a) the nature and incidence of independent learning defined as "knowing how to generate and direct the processes of learning...*(see p.3) in new entrant classroom settings and, b) the nature of the teacher-child interactions associated with such independent learning. Systematic observation was used at school entry and three months later, to identify aspects of independent learning and the associated teacher behaviours. Six categories of child directed acts identified the range of behaviours from which independent learning could be inferred. Each category of teacher behaviour that appeared to facilitate independent learning in children was developed as a "mirror image" of each category of child directed acts. The teacher and four children in two new entrant classes were observed over the whole day for five days during two observation periods, one at the beginning of Term three and the other after 12 weeks. Each class was involved in normal classroom activities that covered the whole curriculum. The children were engaging in a considerable amount of independent learning on entry to school and three months later. Many facilitative teaching acts occurred in the interactive style that was demonstrated in all aspects of the curriculum. The teachers spent a considerable portion of teaching time assisting children in one-to-one teaching situations and in small groups, encouraging their responses and fostering and supporting independence in their learning. There was some difference observed between teachers in the attention given to different categories and in the facilitative behaviour occurring in one-to-one interactions and small group teaching interactions. A way of teaching emerges that differs from a teaching agenda determined by didactic, traditional instruction. The two teachers were deemed to be using the children's agenda to foster and support them in independent learning in the various curriculum areas. Some of the practical and philosophical features of the New Zealand education system that may contribute to this particular style of teaching are discussed. The theories of learning and teaching deriving from this study place a value on independent learning (as here defined) in new entrant children and on the teacher&#8217;s role in providing opportunities for it to develop. Independent learning a) ensures the continuation of learning at times when the teacher is directly engaged with other children, and b) derives from a teacher expectation that children will be able to actively process ideas and make some decisions about their learning. It engenders a power in children that sustains the momentum of learning.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2438</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology of the New Zealand glowworm Arachnocampa luminosa (Skuse) (Diptera : Lycetophilidae) in tourist caves at Waitomo</field><field name="creator">Pugsley, Chris, 1953-</field><field name="description">The New Zealand glowworm Arachnocampa luminosa (Diptera: Mycetophilidae) provides the national tourist industry with a unique attraction. The Glowworm Cave at Waitomo has an international reputation for the bioluminescent display produced by A. luminosa. The aim of the present study was to investigate glowworm ecology in the tourist caves at Waitomo, the results to provide factual information so that scientifically sound management procedures could be devised to ensure the long term survival of the population. The literature on all aspects of A. luminosa is reviewed. A continuous cycle of development occurs with most stages present throughout the year. However, the majority of the larval population pupates in late winter/early spring, producing a new generation in spring/early summer. There are five larval instars; the time for individual development in the Glowworm Cave varies considerably but is estimated to take 5 months on average. Distribution of glowworms is dependent on an adequate food supply, cool, moist climate and a suitable horizontal rock surface. Their diet consists of chironomids with some tipulids, ephemeropterans and trichopterans, most of which emerge inside the cave. Factors likely to influence distribution and productivity of benthic fauna in the cave are reviewed, including the importance of flooding and stream drift fauna in restocking the cave. Mortality is caused by two species of opiliones, cannibalism and a fungal pathogen identified as Tolypocladium sp. (Moniliales). Preliminary experiments with Tolypocladium indicate that the higher temperatures of the Glowworm Cave may be responsible for the prevalence of the fungus compared with non-tourist caves in the district. Observations on cave climate showed that the Glowworm Cave now has a higher range of temperature and relative humidity compared with earlier records and non-tourist caves at Waitomo. This is attributed in part to the free flow of air that occurs between the two entrances of the cave and the outside atmosphere. Reasons for the decline in the glowworm display that has occurred in the past few years are discussed. The installation of an open grille on the Top Entrance of the Glowworm Cave in 1975 is suggested as one of the main factors responsible. Future research projects are mentioned, together with recommendations for cave management related to glowworm ecology.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2439</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The utilisation of cyclopropyl compounds in the synthesis of troponoids</field><field name="creator">Gravatt, Gary Lance</field><field name="description">The fully regio-controlled synthesis of C1a-C12a mono-seco colchicine 133, as well as a number of structurally interesting analogues, has been achieved.

Chromosome numbers for the following taxa are confirmed: P. kumeraho A. Cunn. 2n = 24, P. aspera Sieber (cultivated) 2n = 24, P. phylici-folia Lodd. 2n = 48, P. rugosa Cheeseman 2n = 48, P. erici-folia Hook. 2n = 36, P. hamiltonii L.B. Moore 2n = 36, P. edgerleyi Hook. 2n = 37, P. novae-zelandiae stat.nov. 2n = 36. In P. kumeraho, breeding experiments, and studies of the ovule show that plants are self fertile, and reproduction is sexual. Microsporogenesis studies show some asyndesis, and the presence of fragments of unexplained origin at meiosis. Half the microspores formed are inviable. The triploid taxa reproduce by agamospermy. The origin of the embryo sac is diplosporous. Although breeding experiments indicate that pollination improves seed set, endosperm chromosome counts in P. hamiltonii show that fertilisation of the endosperm nucleus does not occur. A physiological stimulatory effect from pollination is postulated. At microsporogenesis in the triploid taxa, some restitution occurs at the first meiotic division with the formation of large unreduced pollen grains. The rate of restitution is variable and is affected by both environmental and genetic factors. Restitution is correlated with high univalent frequency, and restituting cells exhibit little Anaphase I movement of chromosomes. Pollen of triploids is highly variable in size, pore number, and viability. P. phylicifolia shows mostly bivalents at meiosis, producing 25-30% viable pollen with reduced chromosome number. Reproduction is mainly sexual, but there is some indication that agamospermy may also occur. P. rugosa shows a high proportion of multivalents at meiosis, and segregation is irregular. Viable pollen with a reduced chromosome number is below 5%. Restitution may occur at meiosis under certain conditions. Reproduction is presumed to be agamospermous. The comparative morphology of the New Zealand and Australian taxa of Pomaderris was also studied from herbarium specimens. The data were analysed using numerical taxonomic methods. Four clusters of O.T.U.s are identified, but many O.T.U.s are intermediate in morphology and do not belong to a cluster. The New Zealand taxa are spread among the four clusters. Each N.Z. taxon is closer to an Australian taxon than to other N.Z. taxa. Pollen of Australian specimens was compared with pollen of known N.Z. polyploids. The existence of polyploids and apomicts among the Australian taxa is suggested. Taxonomy and origin of the New Zealand polyploid taxa are discussed.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2441</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Labour mobility and economic transformation in Solomon Islands: lusim Choiseul, bae kam baek moa?</field><field name="creator">Friesen, Wardlow.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the relationship of labour mobility and socioeconomic transformation in the Solomon Islands, and proposes that one cannot be understood in isolation from the other. Explanation is pursued both at the levels of structure and of agency, and integration of these levels is attempted in some places. This is discussed in the first part of the thesis, within a general discussion of issues of theory and method. The second part of the thesis deals with the structural parameters of labour mobility. Through the twentieth century, the institutions of government, mission and capitalist enterprise have been central in shaping the Solomon Islands social formation. The roles of these formal institutions with implications for labour mobility have ranged from purveyors of ideology to employers of labour. Another major element in the social formation is an original Melanesian mode of production which influences labour mobility through village-level institutions such as the land tenure system, kinship, and household operation. Labour circulation is a major factor in linking village and non-village institutions, and more abstractly in articulating two different modes of production. The third part of the thesis considers the ways in which individual agency operates within structure. The data base are life histories and related information from the Mbambatana language group on the island of Choiseul. This is integrated with national, regional and village-level structural information. Education is important in the way it 'selects' individuals for certain kinds of employment. This selection process occurs within the wage economy generally, but is further refined within institutions of employment. This results in labour mobility 'streams' which have identifiable characteristics related to gender, education, and employment type. Movements within each 'stream' have typical temporal and spatial characteristics. Patterns of labour mobility, especially sequence, are affected by gender and life cycle factors. For men and women the most critical changes take place in the 20s age span, but individual behaviour varies according to marriage and childrearing patterns. From a village perspective, labour circulation is a logical response to the necessity of operating within two different economic systems typified by different modes of production. This process of articulation is manifest in other ways as well, and households or families may adopt different strategies in operating within two different systems. The particular strategy adopted depends on the labour power available, degree of access to land, and employment possibilities of individual members.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370400 Human Geography::370402 Social and cultural geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The structure of reovirus</field><field name="creator">Metcalf, Peter</field><field name="description">The arrangement of the capsomers comprising the outer shell or capsid of reovirus has been determined by the computer modeling of images of reovirus replicas prepared by freeze-etching techniques. An optical low-pass spatial filter was used to improve the visibility of the virus images and two types of capsid subunit could then be seen which were termed ring and pentamer-crater capsomers. Sufficient of them could be identified on reovirus particles to make the computer modeling of the particle possible. The capsid was shown by these methods to have T=13,1 triangulated icosahedral symmetry. It is comprised of 60 ring capsomers and 12 pentamer craters surrounded by another 60 incomplete ring capsomers. The same T=13,1 symmetry was found for the single-shelled particles of the two rotaviruses, SA-11 and NCDV, which have 132 uniform capsomers. However, fragments of reovirus capsids, such as are sometimes seen in negatively stained reovirus preparations, were found which had non-T=13,1 symmetry, presumably as a result of capsomer rearrangement. The dimensions of a large number of the triangular subunits of these capsid fragments were measured and it was shown that triangles originating from different parts of the reovirus capsid had non-identical lengths. The lengths found were consistent with the T=13,1 model proposed for the virus. Conditions favouring the formation of crystalline aggregates of reovirus core particles have been found. The unit cell geometry of the two classes of crystals obtained was determined.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2443</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A structural investigation of some light atom molecules</field><field name="creator">Buckleton, John</field><field name="description">A series of structures of light atom molecules is presented.

It is therefore important to gain an understanding of the reactivity of these functional groups. The metal-carbon double bond is introduced in Chapter 1 with a literature review and the following two chapters are concerned with the synthesis and properties of a new class of Group VIII metal carbene complexes containing the prototype carbene ligand, =CH2. The synthetic route to the first of these complexes involves a new low-valent osmium complex OsCl(NO) (PPh3)3. The synthesis of this complex from a reformulated complex containing the novel peroxycarbonyl ligand is discussed in Chapter 2, followed by simple reactions including the synthesis of a range of acetylene, allene and heteroallene &#960;-adducts. The reactions establish that OsCl(NO)(PPh3)3 reacts as the osmium analogue of IrCl(CO)(PPh3)2. The methylene-ligand synthesis involves the addition of diazomethane to OsCl(NO)(PPh3)3 to give the structurally characterised Os(CH2)Cl(NO)(PPh3)2. The reaction has been extended to give the first isolable ruthenium and iridium methylene complexes. The reactions of these complexes establish the nucleophilicity of the double bond and two Lewis acid adducts, Os(CH2AuI)Cl(NO)(PPh3)2 and [Os(CH2S(O)O)Cl(NO)(PPh3)2]ClO4, have been structurally characterised. The reaction with CO and isocyanides to form ketene and ketenimine ligands illustrates a different mode of reaction that is interpreted in terms of the non-innocent participation of the nitrosyl ligand. The change from nucleophilicity to electrophilicity of the double bond with a reduction of metal electron density is illustrated by reactions of Os(CH2Cl)Cl2(NO)(pph3)2 which implicate [OS(CH2)Cl2(NO)(PPh3)2]+ as an intermediate. Os(CH2Cl)Cl2(NO)(PPh3)2 is formed by addition of Cl2 to Os(CH2)Cl(NO)(PPh3)2. In Chapter 4 a different type of metal-carbon double bond is discussed. The complexes contain the relatively uncommon dichlorocarbene ligand and the synthesis of the first such iridium complex, Ir(CCl2)Cl3(PPh3)2 is described. The utility of the dichlorocarbene ligand in the synthesis of a range of carbene ligands including monochlorocarbene complexes is illustrated. The most useful single reaction of the dichlorocarbene complexes is that forming a metal-carbon triple bond. A review of the literature concerning carbyne complexes is presented in Chapter 5 and the synthesis and reactions of a number of carbyne complexes is discussed in Chapter 6. Like the methylene complexes, the carbyne complexes such as Os(CPh)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 contain nucleophilic metal-carbon bonds and Os(CHPh)Cl2(CO)(PPh3)2 resulting from HCl addition has been structurally characterised. However, just as the reactivity can be changed with the methylene complexes, the reduction of metal electron density in complexes such as [Os(CR)Cl2 (CNR')(PPh3)2]ClO4 (R = C6H4-4-NMe2, R' = C6H4-4-Me) makes the triple bond electrophilic. Two methods for synthesising these octahedral carbyne complexes are described. One, involving a reaction of complexes such as Os(CPh)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 with oxygen and the formation of another peroxycarbonyl ligand, the other a reaction with iodine to give complexes such as Ru(CPh)ClI2(PPh3)2. Reactions with chlorine by contrast lead to a group of reactive chlorophenyl carbene complexes. Where appropriate, the reactivity of the complexes described is interpreted in terms of frontier-orbital and charge controlled reactions using the current models for the carbene and carbyne complexes.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2445</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The calculation of cloud parameters from AVHRR data</field><field name="creator">Grainger, Roy Gordon</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with the electromagnetic radiation that is reflected from and emitted by a clear or cloudy terrestrial atmosphere. Calculations are performed in order to estimate the radiation exitant to space in the visible, the near visible, and the two infrared windows at approximately 4 &#956;m and 11 &#956;m. The NOAA-9 satellite Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR/2) is used as the data acquisition system. The satellite AVHRR system is described, as well as future TIROSN satellites. The pre-launch calibration of the radiometer is described in some detail. Post-launch calibration is examined using a reflectance difference method. The radiometer gains are shown to have changed by more than 20% from their pre-launch values. A LOWTRAN based atmospheric model suitable for New Zealand is developed to provide cloud free transmission values. Atmospheric scattering is shown to contribute negligibly to visible cloud measurements (for 8-bit radiometer resolution). The Channels 1 to 3 terrestrial reflectance is averaged from more than two years of satellite data. Sea-surface state is examined as a function of windspeed. A method of extracting surface temperature in rugged terrain is developed. Dual temperature measurements at 10.8 and 11.8 &#956;m are used to estimate surface air temperature. The transfer of radiation in a single layer cloud is calculated as a function of cloud thickness, observation/illumination geometry and the effective radius of the cloud drop-distribution. The variation in drop-size is contained in an ensemble of modified-Gamma distributions whose effective radius varies from 1 to 30 &#956;m with a fixed dispersion of 0.25. A technique is established which allows effective cloud radius to be estimated from 3.7 &#956;m AVHRR/2 imagery. The radiation values at 0.65 &#956;m and 11.8 &#956;m are used to correct the 3.7 &#956;m reflectance for variation in cloud thickness and temperature respectively. The procedure is limited to warm clouds of moderate optical depth. In addition, the inversion process generates values of cloud top height and temperature, cloud depth and column liquid water content. The method is used to observe the development of orographic cloud formed over the southern half of the North Island of New Zealand. The inversion results for this type of cloud are in agreement with aircraft measurements carried out by the New Zealand Meteorological Service and are well fitted by a simple drop-growth model.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2446</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study of the magellanic clouds and other southern objects at TeV energies</field><field name="creator">Bond, Ian Anthony</field><field name="description">The results of observational studies of very high energy (VHE) and ultra high energy (UHE) gamma ray emission, by various astrophysical objects, made from 1988 to 1990 with the JANZOS Cerenkov facility are presented.

Various objects in the Magellanic Clouds were monitored for UHE gamma ray emission using the Cerenkov technique at large zenith angles. This technique has been found to be more sensitive at UHE energies -100 TeV than the conventional air shower technique. During 1990 the equipment was modified to allow a sky coverage of 7&#176;&#215;23&#176; at large zenith angles. This enabled most of the extent of the Large Magellanic Cloud to be surveyed at UHE energies. An examination of the UHE database yielded no evidence for persistent emission from SN1987A and selected X-ray pulsars in the Magellanic Clouds. Upper limits on the UHE fluxes (in cm-2s-1) above the given threshold energies were obtained as follows: SMC X-1, 2.4&#215;10-13 (&gt;30 TeV); SN1987A, 2.3&#215;10-13 (&gt;65 TeV); PSR0540-693, 2.3&#215;10-13(&gt;65 TeV); LMC Trans, 1.5&#215;10-13(&gt;130 TeV); LMC X-4, 1.3&#215;l0-l3 (&gt;140 TeV). Evidence was found for two episodes of pulsed gamma ray emission above 65 TeV from SN1987A. On the nights of May 28 and June 23, 1990, a periodicity search using the Rayleigh test showed significant power at 18.356 ms. This is near a periodicity reported at optical wavelengths in September, 1990. The chance probability for the individual period was about 10-6 on each of the two nights. Excess events of the order of 1&#963; were also seen on these nights. The overall chance probability, allowing for all degrees of freedom, was found to be 0.1%. Evidence was also found for a single episode of gamma ray emission above 140 TeV from LMC X-4 on May 27, 1990. Excess events were seen with a statistical significance of 2.4 &#963;. A periodicity test showed maximum Rayleigh power at 13.488 s on this night. The chance probability for the individual period was 8&#215;10-3 and the overall chance probability was found to be 0.5%. Adopting a recent estimate of the pulsar population in the Large Magellanic Cloud, an upper bound of 3&#215;1034 erg s-1 on the luminosity of an average pulsar, at energies &gt;65 TeV, was obtained.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2447</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Blueschists and associated rocks in the south Sepik region, Papua New Guinea; field relations, petrology, mineralogy, metamorphism and tectonic setting</field><field name="creator">Ryburn, Roderick James</field><field name="description">Blueschists in the South Sepik region of Papua New Guinea are one of several poorly known occurrences along the northern margin of New Guinea's Central Orogenic Belt. It is believed that they formed in a northward-dipping subduction zone, beneath a Palaeogene arc system now accreted along the north coast of New Guinea, and that they now lie within a Tertiary continent-arc collision zone. The South Sepik blueschists, or Tau Blueschist, are situated near the centre of New Guinea, on the northern fall of the island's axial mountains, and are mostly contained in an allochthonous east-west lens (55 x 8 km) known as the Tau body. There are also some much smaller allochthons to the east of the Tau body. The blueschists occur within the late-Mesozoic to Eocene Salumei Formation, which is believed to be a tectonic mixture of mostly politic sediments, derived from the continent to the south, and ophiolite fragments and other volcanogenic rocks, related to the arc to the north. Near the Tau body, the Salumei Formation is metamorphosed from prehnite-pumpellyite to low-greenschist grade. Stratigraphic constraints and isotopic dating indicate an Oligocene to early Miocene metamorphism of the Tau Blueschist, Salumei Formation, and other metamorphic rocks in the region. The blueschists are mostly massive to well-foliated mafic schists, containing abundant blue amphibole, but there are also some intimately associated pelitic-calcareous-graphitic metasediments. Within the Tau body the metamorphic grade increases towards the north, from lawsonite rocks to high-grade epidote blueschists. The lowest grade blueschists are pumpellyitic lawsonitic metabasites, known only from river float. In addition, there are zones and isolated occurrences of coarsely crystalline mafic tectonic blocks, within and just north of the Tau body. These include high-grade blueschist, eclogite and amphibolite. There is a complete spectrum from blueschist to eclogite. Whole-rock chemistry indicates, that all basic rocks are probably metamorphosed mafic ophiolite. The mineralogy and mineral chemistry is similar to other circum-Pacific blueschists, particularly those in New Caledonia. The blue amphibole is glaucophane or crossite, but ferroglaucophane occurs in the lawsonite zone. It is sometimes accompanied by Ca-amphibole, ranging from actinolite, in the lawsonite zone, to barroisite, in the epidote zone. Some metabasites and metasediments contain grossularitic almandine garnet, spessartine rich at low grade to pyropic at high grade. Sodic pyroxene is not particularly common in the blueschists, and is generally an acmitic variety, although omphacite occurs in eclogites. Paragonite is common in the epidote zone, often associated with phengite, while chlorite and albite are present at all grades, generally in small amounts. Calcite, dolomite and chloritoid occur in metasediments of the epidote zone. The unique assemblage lawsonite-glaucophane-chloritoid was found. Apart from zoning in minerals, and minor retrograde alteration, most rocks appear to be equilibrium assemblages, and obey the phase rule. The conditions of metamorphism are estimated from available experimental studies, and calculations based on mineral thermodynamic data. Equilibria involving lawsonite, epidote, grossular, albite, paragonite and quartz suggest 395&#176;C and 7.5 kbar at the disappearance of lawsonite. Metasediments in the middle of the epidote zone yield a minimum of 420&#176;C from the calcite-dolomite geothermometer, and 444&#176; &#177; 20&#176;C from coexistence of chloritoid, garnet, albite paragonite and quartz. A pressure of 10-11 kbar at 500&#176;C is calculated from garnet, epidote, albite, paragonite and quartz in the highest grade blueschists. Corrections to the muscovite-paragonite solvus for pressure and non-binary components give plausible temperatures and pressures for coexisting white micas. Mineral stabilities, and equilibria between paragonite, jadeite, albite, grossular and zoisite, indicate a maximum of 550&#176;C and 15 kbar for eclogites, and that current versions of the garnet-clinopyroxene thermometer are not giving accurate results in eclogites with high jadeite or acmite in the pyroxene. From buffer equilibria between calcite and Ca-Al silicates in metasediments, the non-ideal mole fraction of CO2 is estimated to be about 0.02 in the epidote zone, and 0.002 in the lawsonite zone. Graphite, pyrite and pyrrhotite in metasediments allow calculation of fluid composition in the system C-H-O-S, and show that very minor CH and H2S were present. Water activities may have been high in some eclogites. The metamorphic conditions require that both blueschists and eclogites were formed in a subduction system, and support the continent-arc collision hypothesis. However, some form of active and rapid transport is needed to bring these rocks back to shallow levels, and the term "retrojection" is coined.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2448</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aerobiology of the Auckland region in relation to allergic asthma and rhinitis</field><field name="creator">Hasnain, Syed Mohammed</field><field name="description">Auckland, the largest city in New Zealand, with a population of approx. 700,000, is notorius for its high incidence of respiratory allergies, particularly asthma. At a conservative estimate, one in every ten persons in the region suffers from allergic asthma and/or rhinitis (hay fever). In the Auckland Hospital Board area alone, there were 58 deaths from asthma in 1979 and 57 in 1980 (an average of 5 per month). Asthma and rhinitis affect people of all ages. To investigate the reason for the high incidence of these respiratory allergies, an aerobiological study of the qualitative and quantitative composition of the air spora was thus undertaken. To include a reasonably representative cross section of the region for air sampling three localities from near the centre of the city to the western suburban fringe were chosen along a 20km axis encompassing commercial, residential, agricultural, horticultural and forested environments. A Burkard 7-day recording volumetric spore trap was operated continuously at each locality, from 1 September 1979 to 31 August 1980. Counting and identification of spores and pollen grains were undertaken within 5 random microscope fields along each of 12 traverses across the spore trap tapes representing alternate hours of the day on Mondays and Tuesdays. Data were converted to concentrations (numbers m-3 of air). Of a total of 38 spore or pollen categories recorded, 24 displayed seasonal and circadian periodicities. The survey revealed that there was considerable contamination of the atmosphere by spores of various fungi, particularly in summer and autumn with peaks at all sites in autumn. It is of interest that the admission rate of patients with "status asthmaticus" in the two year period January 1979 &#8211; December 1980, was also high in summer and autumn with peaks in both years in April (autumn). Fungal spores &gt;3&#956;m constituted c. 99% of the Auckland air spora in all seasons, even spring, the chief pollen season. Basidiospores were the most abundant type of the region. Amongst indentified basidiospores, Ganoderma and Coprinus predominated. Basidiospores ascribable to Hypholoma, "Calvatia-Bovista" Tilletiopsis, Entoloma and Thelephora were also recorded. Ascospores of various genera were also abundant at all sites. Among them, those ascribable to the genus Leptosphaeria were most common, followed by "Hypoxylon-Xylaria", Pleospora and Venturia. Conidia of Cladosporium were one of the principal components. Other conidia recorded, although in small numbers, belonged to the genera Polythrincium (trifolii), Epicoccum, Pithomyces (chartarum), Stemphylium, Alternaria, Periconia, Torula, Helicomyces, Helminthosporium (Drechslera), Pestalotia, Cryptostroma, Tetraploa, Arthrinium and Monilia. Conidia of "Aspergillus-Penicillium" type were the most prevalent at the city site. A comparison of the air spora at the three localities revealed major quantitative but not qualitative differences. The suburban locality emerged with higher spore concentrations than the urban and forested sites. The relationships between some meteorological factors and the 14 most prevalent categories of the air spora were analysed. Cladosporium and Polythrincium showed a significant correlation with temperature; unidentifiable ascospores were correlated with midnight temperature, humidity and, strongly, with rainfall; Leptosphaeria correlated with rainfall and midnight temperature. Unidentifiable coloured and hyaline basidiospores as well as Ganoderma and Coprinus were positively correlated with temperature. Coloured basidiospores and Ganoderma also showed a significant "negative" correlation with wind speed. On the basis of the aerobiological findings and a potential link with asthma admissions to hospital a total of 67 aqueous and lyophilized extracts from basidiomycetous fungi collected in the Auckland region were prepared in buffered saline, with W/V standardized concentration, for immunological studies. 'Total protein' content of the extracts were estimated. A total of 129 allergic patients both "heterogeneous group" and diagnosed, attending hospital allergy clinic, were tested by the skin prick method. Over 10% of the patients reacted positively to the crude extracts of the following fungi: Ganoderma mastoporum*, Ganoderma applanatum**, Scleroderma albidum*, Coprinus micaceus*, Lycoperdon compactum*, Hydnum crocidens var. badius**, Xeromphalina podocarpi***, Auricularia polytricha***, Agaricus bisporus*,Bovista brunnea*, Panaeolina foenisecii**, Hypholoma acutum**, Calvatia* sp. Pseudohydnum gelatinosum***, Trametes versicolor***, Favolaschia calocera***, Cortinarius*, Tyromyces*** sp. and Hydnum crocidens**. Allergenicity to many of these genera has rarely been investigated or reported. The findings of the investigation suggest that fungal spores in general, and basidiospores in particular, may play an important role in the high incidence of allergic asthma and rhinitis in the Auckland region. * spores alone extracted ** hymenial tissue extracted *** whole sporophores extracted</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2449</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The structure and function of invertebrate septate junctions</field><field name="creator">Green, Colin Richard</field><field name="description">The structure and function of septate junctions have been studied by ultrastructural techniques in a wide range of invertebrate phyla. Techniques have included conventional and tracer impregnated tissue thin sectioning, and freeze-fracture of both fixed and unfixed tissue. Standard and goniometer stage transmission electron microscopy has been used. Work in this study has been concentrated mainly on the lower invertebrate phyla in which the simplest forms of junction might be seen, and on the higher invertebrate phyla. This latter group is of special interest in the transition region between the invertebrate and vertebrate phyla. Six new types of septate junction and a form of tight junction have been found in invertebrate phyla and are described. Two of these new septate junctions occur in each of the phyla Coelenterata, Echinodermata and Hemichordata. The tight junction occurs in the phylum Tunicata. Further data has also been obtained on five of the six previously described types of septate junction. The distribution of all twelve types within the invertebrates and their phylogenetic relationships are discussed. Work with the goniometer stage has aided in interpreting junctional structures. The results have revealed several features of the septate junction that support the idea that it has a mainly occluding function analogous to that of the vertebrate tight junction. In addition, an anastomosing septate junction has been found in the Echinodermata which is postulated to be a structural intermediate between the invertebrate septate junction and the vertebrate tight junction. A hypothesis is proposed suggesting how the septate junction might have evolved into the vertebrate tight junction. Tricellular junctional regions of most of the septate junction types are noted and briefly described.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2450</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unemployment in New Zealand, 1981-1983: a study of the presentation by radio, television and the press of a major social problem</field><field name="creator">Leitch, Shirley R.</field><field name="description">In New Zealand there is a marked scarcity of material on the workings of the indigenous news media.

From the original cloned hybridoma line, a number of variants have been isolated which grow as different types of tumours in syngeneic mice. One particular strain grows with high efficiency as tumours in the spleen. In contrast to the original hybridoma, the progressive spleen-seeking tumour cells appear to have lost their ability to stimulate the immune system. The contribution that natural killer cell and T cell immunity plays in controlling tumour growth has been demonstrated and the vitro analysis of immune effector cells in the spleen of mice challanged with tumour cells has been investigated.

Particles emitted from a steel mill were studied at their point of emission, during transport through the atmosphere and after deposition. The mill was located in a coastal region removed from other major industrial particle sources which made the identification of the mill particulate emissions possible in ambient samples. The mill utilizes indigenous titanomagnetite ironsand and coal as the raw materials. There is evidence of the surface enrichment of volatile trace elements such as Zn, S, Na, K and P from the raw materials in the particulate emissions. Particle samples were collected from sites within the mill which represented different stages in the iron-making process, including the rotary kilns, electric melting furnaces and the vanadium recovery plant. This established an inventory of particulate emissions. Mill sourced particles were then identified and studied in air samples collected downwind of the mill on silver-coated nucleopore filters. AES and SIMS depth profiling studies indicated the mill particles became surface enriched in sea salt components such as S, predominately as sulfate, Cl- and Na+ after atmospheric aging. This was attributed to their coagulation with the marine derived ambient aerosol. SIMS ion imaging and mass spectral analysis suggested a characteristic "fingerprint" of the mill emissions could be distinguished in the ambient aerosol up to 8 km downwind of the mill. An experimental rig was constructed to model the interaction between the mill particles and the natural marine aerosol. A bubble nebuliser was developed to produce an artificial sea salt aerosol which was reacted with a metal powder in the fluidised bed of the rig. The metal powder was then aged under controlled relative humidity (RH) conditions. It was shown that an iron powder, after reaction and aging at 75% RH, developed an aqueous surface layer which quickly led to electrochemical corrosion, dissolution and oxidation of the particle surface. Evidence of this corrosion of metal particles occurring in the environment was found in a SEM-EDX study of the mill particles deposited on pine needles downwind of the mill. It was argued that these reactions would increase the bio-availability of the particle components. A model which incorporated these observations was developed to describe the morphogenesis of atmospheric primary particles during aging in the New Zealand environment. XPS was used to study ambient aerosols deposited on both botanical and artificial passive sampling surfaces. Plant leaves were shown to be excellent collectors of particulate material and were suited to analysis by XPS. Site differences in the atmospheric aerosol load and composition were detected on vine leaves located on a hill side (high NaCl) and at a roadside (high sulfate and silicates) in a rural area. Zn and Fe species were detected by XPS on pine needles up to 2 km downwind of the steel mill.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2453</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Forensic Applications of Bayesian Inference to Glass Evidence</field><field name="creator">Curran, James Michael</field><field name="description">The role of the scientist in the courtroom has come under more scrutiny this century than ever before.

An important step to managing invasive ant species is determining the factors responsible for their current and potential distribution. This thesis examines the spatial distribution of invasive ant species at a range of scales. The focus is on the Pacific region, specifically Fiji and New Zealand, which have a relatively high number of invasive ant species. Taxonomic checklists of the ant fauna of Fiji and New Zealand are presented. Climate variables were used to model the distribution of, and predict suitable areas for, particular invasive ant species. In general, models had high evaluation success, especially for models that were built and tested within a region. However, the utility of models was far less when transferred and tested in new regions. A better understanding of how climate variables directly and indirectly affect a species is needed to improve the utility of species distribution modeling. On a finer spatial scale, habitat partitioning was evident at Colo-i-Suva Park in Fiji, where distinct ant communities were sampled from litter and canopy habitats. Results suggested that body size, habitat and resource utilisation interact to create opportunities for invasion, and influence the susceptibility of different habitats. Habitat also shaped the assembly of ant communities and mediated inter-specific competition in the Yasawa Islands, Fiji. Similarly, habitat was important in partitioning ant communities in New Zealand; endemic ant species were in forest, and invasive species in scrub and urban habitats. However, there was no evidence that inter-specific competition influenced community composition or the distribution of invasive ant species at regional or local scales in New Zealand. The extent and diversity of exotic ant species arriving at the New Zealand border was also investigated. A high proportion (&gt;64%) of intercepted ants originated from the Pacific. The effectiveness of detecting exotic ant species at the New Zealand border ranged from 48-78% for different pathways, indicating a number of species remain undetected. Future work on invasive ants should focus on species-specific tolerances, and how the physical environment and small scale abiotic conditions influence distribution.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270505 Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2495</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Frederick Weld: a political biography</field><field name="creator">Williams, Jeanine Marie</field><field name="description">Frederick Weld arrived in New Zealand early in 1884, an unassuming and shy twenty-year old with high hopes and modest assets.

Nida of the United Bible Societies. The practice of Bible translation in the modern era was greatly influenced by Nida, and still is to a great extent. His &#8216;functional equivalence&#8217; approach to translation gave priority to communicating the meaning of the text instead of merely retaining the form. His approach also included testing the translation to ensure that average readers understood the meaning. Nida&#8217;s approach was expanded upon by the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL) into what is known as the &#8216;meaning-based&#8217; approach. The difference between it and the functional equivalence approach is mainly one of degree, with the meaningbased approach being freer in several respects than Nida&#8217;s approach. However, there has been a movement away from Nida (as well as SIL&#8217;s meaning-based approach) among many Bible translators. The reasons for this shift are varied, although one major influence has been the growing awareness that the language communities who are the recipients of these translations should have a major part in deciding what kind of translation will be prepared. Such communities often prefer more literal translations. Yet they are seldom given the background information they need to make an informed decision about what approach is appropriate for them, partly because no studies exist which document the objective evaluation and comparison of different approaches to translation of the Bible. This thesis documents actual testing of three types of translation in the Thai language to determine which one most clearly communicates the meaning of the Bible. It was found that the meaning-based translation communicated most clearly for some stories that were tested, the functional equivalence translation achieved the second best results, and a semi-literal translation had the most significant communication problems. The findings also provide dramatic evidence about the limits any translation of the Bible has for people who have never heard its message before. This thesis also describes a new kind of testing of translation quality which the author developed in order to objectively compare different translations in Thai. Subjects were asked to read translated passages and then take a written multiple-choice test about the meaning of the translation. This new kind of testing has several advantages over the kind of testing in general use by most Bible translators.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2458</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Comparative Form, Function and Ecology of some New Zealand Brittle-Stars (Ophiuroidea)</field><field name="creator">Pentreath, Richard John</field><field name="description">In her classic review of the echinoderms, Hyman (1955), describes the ophiuroids as "the most successful echinoderm group living today".

The early stages in the formation of continuous anodic layers of bismuth oxide were studied using the technique of cyclic voltammetry. During this period, the oxide, Bi2O3, covered the surface by a process of simultaneous thickening and spreading of patches. The study of oxide nucleation classified the metal surface into two different areas with different kinetics of oxide nucleation. The ratio of the two areas varied according to the history and original preparation of the surface. Film nucleation was also studied by the galvanostatic step and potentiostatic step methods. The rate of spreading of the oxide patches over the surface was shown to be controlled by the magnitude of the surface area still uncovered. Film thickening was studied using both galvanostatic and cyclic voltammetric techniques. The high field growth law i = &#256; exp (B&#274;) where i is the current density and &#274; the field in the oxide layer, was found with parameters &#256; = (1 &#177; 0.5) x 10-5 A cm-2 B = (2.0 &#177; 0.5) x 10-6 cm V-1 This value of B gives an activation distance for high-field ion transport, a* = 0.2 nm, comparable to the radius of a lattice site. These parameters were determined for very thin films in strongly alkaline electrolyte (pH 13; thickness &lt;30 nm). At greater film thickness, cracking of the film gave a porous layer on top of a continuous barrier layer, and the apparent value of the parameter B increased to 1.7 x 10-5 cm v-1. All previous work on the bismuth anodic film thickening process has been affected to some extent by cracking of the film. In this work, cracking of the film was confirmed by microscopic observation, including scanning electron microscopy. Dissolution of the film, giving breakdown of the oxide layer and pitting of the metal, was an important phenomenon. It became particularly significant for pH &lt;8. The thickness attained by the anodic bismuth oxide layer was limited by this process to only 4 nm at pH 5, increasing to over 200 nm at pH 13. The cathodic reduction of the oxide proceeded from the outer surface inwards, and a rough, porous metal surface resulted. A model involving electron injection from the metal into the oxide, diffusion of electrons through the film and their reaction at the outer surface has been proposed. Microscopic observation confirmed the porous nature of the electro-reduced surface. The transient conductivity of the bismuth anodic film has been investigated, and the effects of standing at open-circuit in the electrolyte or of heating in air studied. The galvanostatic method was used. The observed effects could be adequately explained as being due to the presence ofanon-stoichiometric, n-type (excess metal) layer at the film-solution interface. Cyclic voltammetry was used to investigate the possibility of nucleation of anodic bismuth oxo-halides from solutions containing halide ions. Solutions containing fluoride, chloride, bromide or iodide at pH 4-9, phosphate and phosphate with added methanol at pH 8.5 were used. Consideration of thermodynamic stability would indicate the formation of new phases, but results showed that, in the comparatively short time scale of the experiments, kinetic factors resulted in the formation of anodic Bi2O3, except when the solution contained iodide at low pH, when the oxo-iodide, BiOI, was probably formed. Room lighting had no effect on the cyclic voltammetric or galvanostatic measurements. The transient response of anodic films on bismuth to an intense flash of white light was studied. In the case of a thick anodic oxide film (240 nm), the results were interpreted in terms of photo-excitation of the film, producing electron-hole pairs which were separated by the applied field. The recombination process was best described as rate-limiting thermal excitation of trapped electrons. The lifetime of an electron in the conduction band of anodic Bi2O3 was determined: &#964;c = 23 ms. The photo-response of a very thin anodic oxide film (4 nm) involved internal photo-emission of electrons from the metal into the oxide. Formation of a positive space charge by the injection of extra cations from the metal into the film followed. The transient photo-potential (galvanostatic experiments) or photo-current (potentiostatic experiments) showed the decay of both excess electronic and ionic space charges. The density of electron traps in the anodic oxide film was determined as NT &gt; 3 x 1018 cm-3. When the anodic film was formed in a solution containing bromide or iodide at pH 5, an inversion of the sign of the primary photo-effect from that observed in the absence of additives (4 nm thick film) was seen, and interpreted in terms of the photo-excitation of halide ions incorporated in the film. The lifetime of a conduction electron in anodic BiOI was determined as 1.5 &#177; 0.2 ms, much less than in anodic Bi2O3 (23 ms). In all the studies of the photo-effect, Gauss' theorem was used to relate the observed photo-potential (galvanostatic experiments) to the photo-induced charge separation. An approximate value of the conduction electron mobility in anodic Bi2O3 was thus obtained: &#956; &#8771; 5 x 10-8 cm2 V-1 s-1. Parameters for the evolution of hydrogen on the bare bismuth metal surface, were obtained: b = 0.11 V, log10(i0/Acm-2) = -10.3 and (&#8706;(log10i0)/&#8706;(PH))&#951; = 0 where &#951; = E &#8211; 60 pH mV.</field><field name="date">1974</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2460</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the mode of action of the antitumour acridine 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulphon-m-anisidide (m-AMSA)</field><field name="creator">Wilson, William R.</field><field name="description">1.	The mode of action of a novel antitumor acridine 4&#8217;-(9-acridinylamino)-methansulphon-m-anisidide (m-AMSA) has been investigated. Two congeners of m-AMSA, 4&#8217;-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulphonanilide (AMSA) and 4&#8217;-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulphon-o-anisidide (o-AMSA) were also studied for comparative purposes. M-AMSA is being evaluated clinically at present under the auspices of the National Cancer Institute, U.S.A. 2.	Treatment of mice bearing the mast cell tumour, mastocytoma P815, with m-AMSA provided some complete cures. AMSA was almost as effective as m-AMSA but its dose potency was 6-fold lower. o-AMSA was inactive. 3.	m-AMSA was found to have a short half-life in mice. Loss of m-AMSA from plasma was due, in part, to the formation of highly fluorescent covalent protein adducts. The rate of this reaction was similar for all three AMSA congeners, and is probably not required for antitumour activity. 4.	The reaction of AMSA drugs with proteins was shown to occur by nucleophilic displacement of the methanesulphonanilide moiety. Evidence is presented that the thiols are the predominant reaction centres in proteins. 5.	A tissue culture model for the antitumour action of m-AMSA was developed using mastocytoma P815 cells. Profound growth inhibition and eventual killing was demonstrated using drug concentrations and durations of exposure attainable in mice. The potencies of the three AMSA congeners paralleled their antitumour potencies in vivo, except at very high drug concentrations. 6.	The rates of biotransformation of AMSA drugs, and their extent of uptake by cells in culture, could not account for the differing potencies of the three AMSA congeners. 7.	M-AMSA prevented the progression of mastocytoma cells through the cell division cycle under conditions where net cell growth was unaffected. Physiologically attainable drug concentrations inhibited chromosome condensation in cells which were less than 10 minutes from the G2-phase/mitosis boundary at the time of drug addition. The sedimentation rate on alkaline sucrose gradients of DNA from cells treated with m-AMSA was lower than that from untreated cells, suggesting that this agent may cause fragmentation of DNA. 8.	A new method for the investigation of the cell cycle stage selectivity of antitumour drugs was developed. This technique demonstrated that m-AMSA and AMSA have significant cycle stage selectivity, the growth of cells late in cycle being most affected. 9.	Spectrophotometric determinations of binding parameters for the interaction of AMSA derivatives with native DNA indicated that m-AMSA bound with lower affinity that did o-AMSA or AMSA. This conclusion was supported by the helix stabilization caused by these drugs. However, the association constants were sufficiently high for each derivative to ensure that essentially all intracellular drug available for binding to DNA would be bound. 10.	The ration of the association constant for native DNA to that for a single-stranded viral RNA was higher for m-AMSA than for AMSA. This selectivity, if operative in vivo, could account for the high dose potency of m-AMSA.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology::270199 Biochemistry and cell biology not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2461</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biophysical studies of macromolecules</field><field name="creator">Wills, Peter Rowland</field><field name="description">Hydrodynamic theories of macromolecular structure have been critically examined and used in the experimental study of the conformation of various biological molecules. This work has been carried out giving careful consideration to ancient and modern wisdom. The fundamental molecular structure of liver glycogen has been investigated using a variety of biophysical techniques, including intensity fluctuation spectroscopy. It has been found that above a certain minimum size, molecules of this material are hydrodynamically equivalent to one another, and behave as if comprised of ideal spherical subunits. Smaller molecules do not have a smooth hydrodynamic surface and display a much higher degree of frictional interaction with the aqueous solvent. It has also been shown that when treated with disulphide-bond breaking reagents, large glycogen molecules are disrupted, but the structure of the subunits is undisturbed. The role of protein in glycogen structure has been confirmed by these studies. Intensity fluctuation spectroscopy has also been applied to the study of protein conformation. The frictional coefficients of bovine serum albumin monomers and dimers have been measured, and an apparent conformational change in the monomer detected upon the binding of salicylate. The unfolding and subsequent aggregation of lysozyme when it is thermally denatured have been observed and the hydrodynamic radii of the native, folded state and the expanded, unfolded state of protein have been measured.

Smith</field><field name="description">One of the traditional aims of the philosophy of science has been to formulate a methodology of science&#8212;that is, a normative theory of scientific method. The rules and standards of such a theory are intended to capture the central features of scientific rationality and to explain the sense in which scientific knowledge progressively grows. Although no particular methodology of science has won universal endorsement, it is generally agreed among philosophers that the broad aim of constructing one is both reasonable and worth pursuing in order to understand the nature of scientific growth. But this aim has also been attacked as fundamentally misconceived by some critics who maintain that no theory of method can do justice to actual science. The objections to the philosophical program of framing a methodology of science come mainly from three quarters. Firstly, there is Paul Feyerabend, according to whom the historical development of science reveals that no set of general normative rules and standards can be given for science. Most of the rules and standards hitherto proposed, he contends, have been violated by scientists and, moreover, were necessarily violated, owing to the incommensurability of revolutionary scientific theories. Secondly, there is Michael Polanyi, who claims that scientific rationality cannot be codified in the explicit rules and standards of any theory of method because much of scientific knowledge and practice is 'tacit' and reflects the personal, unspecifiable contributions of individual scientists. And thirdly, sociologists of scientific knowledge (in particular, those of the Strong Programme) assert that the nature and content of science should be explained in sociological terms rather than by reference to a methodology of science. However, it is argued here that the objections made by Feyerabend, Polanyi and the sociologists to the possibility of a theory of method do not stand up to critical examination. A large part of the anti-methodologists' case is based not only on an overly narrow view of the nature of a theory of method, but also on the mistaken belief that the traditional philosophical and epistemological approach to the investigation of scientific rationality should be replaced by a largely descriptive analysis of scientific practice. This belief is criticised on the grounds that a normative methodology must not be supposed to explain scientific practice, nor can views on the nature of scientific rationality be derived from descriptions of scientific practice. Finally, it is suggested that the positions of Feyerabend, Polanyi, and the Strong Programme have deep affinities with the 'practice-oriented' philosophy of the later Wittgenstein. This may, perhaps, explain why they abandon realist construals of scientific theories, of scientific standards, and of the notion of truth. Like Wittgenstein, they adopt a form of antirealism and conventionalism which leads, ultimately, to a relativist interpretation of scientific standards and knowledge. Coupled with the anti-methodologists' failure to defeat the possibility of a theory of method, this relativism demonstrates the poverty of an attack on method constructed on wittgensteinian lines.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::440000 Philosophy and Religion::440100 Philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2463</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of serial correlation on linear models</field><field name="creator">Triggs, Christopher M.</field><field name="description">Given a linear regression model y = X&#946; + e, where e has a multivariate normal distribution N(0, &#931;) consequences of the erroneous assumption that e is distributed as N(0, I) are considered.

Tests fox the classroom measurement of two components were developed. The components were; PHIL(CC), the claiming of concern for other persons as an overriding, universal, and prescriptive principle in moral decision making; and; GIG, knowledge of factual information which is relevant in making moral decisions which subjects face. The test development exercise was undertaken at a time when public interest in moral education was growing. The recent demand for moral education in Auckland is reviewed. Over the last fifteen years, since the Currie Commission Report, reports by committees investigating the purposes of schools have increasingly emphasised moral and social education as school objectives. The Department of Education appeared to be sympathetic towards the cause of moral education. The submissions made by the public during the Educational Development Conference suggested that, in general, parents and citizens were prepared to consider innovative programmes in social or moral education, although there was little agreement on what form such training or education should take. A number of teachers were supporters of moral education. The primary purpose in constructing tests for Wilson's components was to provide an instrument which would assist in the evaluation of moral education curriculum projects in Auckland secondary schools. Evidence concerning descriptive, content, domain selection, construct and concurrent validity is presented. Kuder-Richardson, retest and criterion-referenced reliability studies were undertaken. It is claimed that an instrument with sufficient validity and reliability has bean produced for the summative evaluation of curriculum projects, and the diagnostic investigation of class groups using the test as a criterion-referenced measure. Auckland intermediate and secondary school pupils were surveyed, using the tests produced and punch card recording in an attempt to identify significant variables. Over 1,100 children completed the tests under controlled conditions. Significant variables identified using the test for PHIL(CC) were socio-economic level for twelve-year-old children, and intelligence for sixteen-year-old children. The effect of schooling appeared to be significant at all levels. Age does not appear to markedly increase children's concern for others. Age was related to performance in the knowledge test. Older children knew more. Other significant variables for GIG were socio-economic level (middle levels performed better) and the effects of schooling. There was some evidence that females know more than males. In both tests it appears that there is considerable interaction between the variables. Suggestions for the further development of the tests are given.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2466</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An input-output model of Northland's economy: with application to forestry</field><field name="creator">Moore, Chris (Christopher Ivor),1947-</field><field name="description">This work presents a 50-industry input-output model of Northland's economy and demonstrates how input-output analysis could be used to enhance regional planning in New Zealand. As it is the first regional input-output model in this country to incorporate significant survey and secondary data the survey procedure and model construction are outlined. The input-output table is used to discuss important regional transactions and the purchase and sales patterns of industries. The model analyses industries' contributions to export receipts and import payments and calculates the impact of changes in export receipts on regional income and imports. A comprehensive multiplier analysis of Northland's economy covers output, income, employment and imports and confidence limits for the multipliers are developed using the Monte Carlo technique to simulate survey errors. The model explores the economic implications of forestry expansion in Northland and discusses the areas available for afforestation, planting rates, tree management, wood supply and wood processing options in the region. The modifications made to the model and data requirements for simulating forestry expansion are outlined and employment and income impacts given for three types of processing complexes and for forestry expansion as a whole. Finally an economic evaluation is made of the impacts of processing-plant construction and supporting services.</field><field name="date">1981</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290500 Mechanical and Industrial Engineering::290501 Mechanical engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2467</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bonding in d10 transition metal complexes</field><field name="creator">Whiting, R.

(Cheng Yi), 1938-</field><field name="description">Building on Kibblewhite's long term investigations of the nonlinear wave-wave interactions and the infrasonic ocean noise and the microseisms these induce, this thesis further explores the physical nature of these processes. The classical description of this interaction, which takes into account only the homogeneous component of the induced field, has been extended to include the inhomogeneous component. A complete expression for the wave induced noise spectrum is established following a geometrical analysis of the dispersion relations among interacting waves. The relative importance of these two components and their directivity properties are also calculated and discussed. It is shown that while at observation points deeper than 500 meters the effects of the inhomogeneous component can be regarded as negligible, it can cause an increase of noise level of up to 40 dB in the region near the surface of the sea. Furthermore, in contrast to the nearly omni-directional distribution of the homogeneous component of the induced acoustic field, there is a tendency for the energy associated with the inhomogeneous component to focus in the wind direction. Based upon a multilayer analysis of a visco-elastic geoacoustic model, Green's functions and the spectral transfer functions relating the surface source pressure field to the underwater noise and microseism fields are derived for both near and far field cases. A 3-dimensional presentation defined on the dispersion plane (frequency and horizontal wave number) is introduced to describe the sea bottom reflection-loss and, Green's functions, and is extended to include the inhomogeneous region for the first time. The characteristics of this 3-D presentation are explained in terms of the geoacoustic parameters. The influence of the interaction of multiple seas (and swell) on the induced acoustic field are also discussed in this thesis. All these effects are considered in the calculation of the synthetic spectra of both the noise and microseism field. When compared with measured data excellent agreement is found between the theoretical and experimental results, which provides further confirmation that the nonlinear interaction is the most important source of the infrasonic ocean noise, as well as confirming the basic validity of the procedure introduced by Kibblewhite and Ewans to derive the ocean noise spectra from microseism records.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2469</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A privileged moment: 'dialogue' in the language of the Second Vatican Council 1962-65</field><field name="creator">Nolan, Ann Michele</field><field name="description">No digital copy at the request of the author - refer to citation field for details of published version.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::440000 Philosophy and Religion::440200 Religion and Religious Traditions</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2470</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Growth and development of intellectually handicapped children</field><field name="creator">Sims, Margaret R.</field><field name="description">There have been no studies in New Zealand designed to investigate the effectiveness of the major "systems-based" intervention programme available for intellectually handicapped children; the service offered by the New Zealand Society for the Intellectually Handicapped. The Society does not have a standardised programme running in all its Preschool/Special Care Centres throughout the country. However, the Auckland branch developed a formalised approach to programming and teaching in 1979. This study attempted to determine the effectiveness of this new approach in terms of the children it was designed to benefit. It was found that children attending Auckland Preschool/Special Care Centres did show greater rates of progress than children attending Preschool/Special Care Centres outside Auckland for a variety of different skills. For Downs Syndrome children these were self-help, cognitive and language skills. For motor-delayed multihandicapped children the skills were selp-help and language. These differences persisted when differences between the social and environmental backgrounds of the children from Auckland and outside Auckland were controlled for. It was also found that Downs Syndrome, motor-delayed multihandicapped and normal children showed different rates of progress for motor, socialisation, cognitive/academic and language skills. Rates of progress were not different for self-help skills although the absolute level of achievement was significantly different for the three populations. The three groups of children showed different rates of growth in a variety of physical measurements, and different absolute sizes in several others. Downs Syndrome children have shorter limbs than either of the other two groups of children. They also have the narrowest jaws and a small thorax. Motor-delayed multihandicapped children have the smallest limb diameters but have the longest faces. Downs Syndrome, motor-delayed multihandicapped and normal children differ in several ways in their social and environmental backgrounds. Parents of Downs Syndrome children are older than parents of the other two groups. Mothers of intellectually handicapped children are less likely to have a job than mothers of normal children. Different health records are evident between the three populations. Normal children tend to be seen as more healthy by their parents. Intellectually handicapped children tend to have less ascorbic acid in their diet than normal children. Downs Syndrome children are more susceptible to minor environmental fluctuations than motor-delayed multihandicapped or normal children. The cumulative effect of this hostile environment can be seen in their short stature and smaller overall body dimensions compared to normal children. Motor-delayed multihandicapped children do not show the same reaction to the environment as Downs Syndrome children. In this more severely handicapped group, the effect of the motor and intellectual handicap over-rides any effect the environment might have. However, nutritional intake is closely related to physical growth in these children. This is because in most cases exercise does not mediate between nutritional intake and physical growth.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2471</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies in the Alseuosmiaceae</field><field name="creator">Gardner, R. O. (Rhys Owen), 1949-</field><field name="description">The flowering plant family Alseuosmiaceae comprises three genera of shrubs: Alseuosmia A. Cunn. from New Zealand; Memecylanthus Gilg and Schltr. and Periomphale Baill. (=Pachydiscus Gilg and Schltr.) from New Caledonia. These genera are readily excluded from their traditional position in the Caprifoliaceae by virtue of their alternate leaves, valvate corolla lobes and their southern hemisphere distribution. Four species of Alseuosmia, including one hitherto undescribed species, are accepted here. The New Caledonian genera are poorly represented in herbaria; they may each be monotypic. Condensed tannin (leucocyanidin) and ellagitannin are abundant in all Alseuosmia tissues. Other simple phenolic compounds here (as detected in acid hydrolysates) include quercetin, kaempferol, caffeic acid and p-coumaric acid. Triterpenoid saponins are abundant in leaf tissue; alkaloids and probably iridoid compounds too, are absent. Tannin is found throughout the ovary tissue of Alseuosmia and in the inner and outer epidermises of the ovular integument. The floral vascular anatomy is detailed for the Alseuosmiaceae and reviewed for eight allied families. No features of the vascular system imply particular affinity of the Alseuosmiaceae with any of these allies. Within this family the association of different morphological and anatomical floral features supports the contention that primitive characters tend to be associated with one another in their distribution throughout the members of a taxon. The primary vascular pattern in the stem of Alseuosmia is of an open (sympodial) nature. The mature nodal anatomy is 3-trace trilacunar. All genera have a stem endodermis with prominent Casparian banding, and in Alseuosmia at least this endodermis passes through the secondary and quaternary stages (lignification-suberisation of walls; accumulation of phenolic compounds) as found in a typical root endodermis. All species of Alseuosmia lack rays in the secondary wood, whereas memecylanthus and Periomphale have extremely tall (indefinitely-prolonged?) rays. The vessels of these genera are relatively primitive (end-plate angle c.10-19&#176;, no bars per scalariform plate c.16-37), and thus are comparable to vessels of the Escalloniaceae and Caprifoliaceae. The root periderm has a cortical origin in Alseuosmia and the root pith is persistent. Multicellular uniseriate hairs are found in the leaf axils in all Alseuosmiaceae. Hairs with similar structure and development are found in some genera of Pittosporaceae but not, so far as is known, in other related groups. Within Pittosporum, these uniseriate hairs appear to be homologous with the T-hairs many species have. The chromosome number of 2n=18 probably characterises all the species of Alseuosmia. A. macrophylla A. Cunn. is an obligate outbreeder with an incompatibility mechanism operating at the stylar level, while A. pusilla is self-compatible. Pollinating agents for the species are unknown. No internal barriers to hybridism exist between A. macrophylla and A. banksii A. Cunn. and the hybrid swarm between these species is recognised here as A. X quercifolia A. Cunn. Neither do internal barriers exist between A. macrophylla and A. pusilla, but differences in flowering time and mode of breeding help to keep these species separate in the field. Mature pollen of Alseuosmia is trinucleate: the ovule is uni-tegmic-tenuinucellate. The distinctness of the Alseuosmiaceae is upheld and its affinities are suggested to be with the Escalloniaceae, and to a lesser extent, with the Pittosporaceae.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2472</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A dendroclimatic study of Phyllocladus trichomanoides D. Don (tanekaha)</field><field name="creator">Palmer, Jonathan Gray</field><field name="description">This thesis demonstrates some of the potential of Phyllocladus trichomanoides D. Don (tanekaha) for dendrochronological research, especially dendroclimatology. The type of vegetation associated with sites producing a chronology showed no obvious pattern. The resulting non-specific range of suitable sites for dendrochronological sampling was thought to be a favorable species characteristic. Standardization of tree-ring series using a 50-year Gaussian filter resulted in 28% improvement of retained common variance above that obtained from using conventional polynomial filters. The problem of autocorrelation was investigated. Tanekaha had a consistent autocorrelation pattern through both space (i.e. latitudinal and altitudinal ranges) and time (preserved forest and contemporary stands). P. glaucus (toatoa) also showed a spatially consistent yet distinctive pattern. These different diagnostic patterns implied a non-climatic cause (i.e. physiological), illustrating the need to ensure their removal before species chronologies are compared or used for climate modelling. Low order autoregressive models (ARMA(p,0)) were used to filter out the significant levels of autocorrelation. Subsequent comparison of the chronologies showed a consistent and highly significantly correlated pattern between both sites and species. The paucity of information about the physiology of Phyllocladus spp. led to the testing of several climatic variables in response function analyses. The "best" variables (based on only statistical evidence) were minimum monthly temperature, monthly total raindays and an optimal 12 month span of August (t) to July (t+1). Preliminary attempts with response functions using different combinations of predictor (climate variables) and predictand (chronologies) data sets generally failed to verify. Neither the extent of time from which the response functions were based (no analogue situation) nor a supposed "physiological shock" period (poor growth period) were the causes for non-verification. Further investigation showed that, for both the individual and combined chronologies, the temperature response was similar but rainfall varied. The instability through time of the rainfall response was particularly disconcerting since it broke one of the fundamental assumptions used in dendroclimatology. It was therefore concluded that climatic reconstruction could be attempted only on the temperature data. The temperature data of three seasons (spring, summer and autumn) were tried with transfer function models. Of these the summer season explained the most variance and had the highest reduction of error(RE) values. The selected model used the period 1918 to 1982 for calibration and 1853 to 1917 for verification. Summer temperatures from 1982 to 1750 were reconstructed. The reconstruction modeled only c.30% of the variance but was highly correlated to the summer temperature series developed by Norton (1983). This was interpreted as further independent verification of the reconstructed series. The summer temperatures reconstructed from 1982 to 1750 were concluded to have been similar to the recorded pattern from 1853. The same regressors were applied to the buried forest chronology and the summer temperatures reconstructed from 105 BC to AD 175. Because of the non-continuous tree-ring record no comment can be made of actual ambient conditions in comparison to those of today. However, the reconstructed pre-Taupo summer series did show increased variation towards the time of the eruption and more pronounced cool summers than hot ones. Another applied use of a tanekaha chronology was demonstrated with 14C dating. A statistically significant fit of 14C ages was obtained between twelve contiguous decades from the buried forest tanekaha chronology with that from a Northern hemisphere decadal calibration curve based on Sequioadendron giganteum(Stuiver &amp; Becker 1986). This "wiggle-matching" to the calibration curve places the year of the Taupo eruption as AD 177&#177;18 10. An Independent check of the "new" date was conducted using the most reliable data of Healy et al. (1964) with the same calibration series as described above. A date of AD177&#177;4 44 was obtained which supports the wiggle-matched date. The confidence interval of the wiggle-matched date also coincides with the date proposed by Wilson et al.

All isolates were screened on Pinus radiata wood chips for their survival and colonisation attributes. Of these isolates, two hundred and eighty two failed to grow or caused permanent deep seated discolourations or decay and were eliminated from the study. The remaining five hundred and sixty six isolates were assessed for their antagonistic ability against sapstain. In a dual screen on Pinus radiata wood chips, one hundred and twelve fungal and four bacterial isolates inhibited the growth of the known sapstain fungus, Ophiostoma piceae. In a second biological control screen, on Pinus radiata wood blocks, isolates of Gliocladium viride, Gliocladium roseum, Trichoderma hamatum, Trichoderma harzianum, Trichoderma sp., Trichothecium roseum and an isolate of the Thelephoraceae proved inhibitory to the sapstain isolates Ophiostoma piceae and Sphaeropsis sapinea providing between 94 and 100% control. These isolates were considered for further examination in the field. The remaining isolates provided poor or inconsistent inhibition or were mould fungi and, therefore, not suitable for direct application. All fungal and bacterial isolates that had shown inhibitory ability in the initial biological control screen and the remaining non-staining bacteria were examined for their ability to produce non-volatile metabolites that were inhibitory to sapstain. The bacterial isolates were examined in a preliminary dual plate screen in which 91 isolates were identified as producing inhibitory compounds. The best of these bacterial isolates were screened, with the fungal isolates, in a non-volatile metabolite trial utilising filter sterilised culture filtrates. Isolates of Bacillus sp., Fusarium solani, Gliocladium roseum, Gliocladium virens, Trichoderma harzianum, Trichoderma sp., Trichoderma viride and Trichothecium roseum were found to be significantly inhibitory to the growth of Ophiostoma piceae at concentrations of 50% or less. However, the filtrates did not provide adequate sapstain control, when tested on Pinus radiata wood block, to prompt consideration for further examination in the field. Studies are currently examining several of these isolates for the production of biologically active compounds. The six most promising isolates, from the wood chip and wood block trials, were tested in the field for their ability to control sapstain on unseasoned Pinus radiata sapwood and/or peeled logs. These were Gliocladium viride (FK75), Trichoderma hamantum (FK561), Trichoderma harzianum (FK228), Trichoderma sp. (FK247), Trichothecium roseum (FK238) and an isolate of the Thelephoraceae (FK33). The fungi were prepared as mycelial/spore homogenates. For application to the timber, the homogenates were mixed with 0.2% Alcosorb gel, producing 108 cfu/ml suspensions, these suspensions were applied by dipping. Diluted homogenates, 108 cfu/ml, were applied as spray treatments to the logs. All of the biological control agent treatments reduced the level of sapstain on either the logs or timber with Trichoderma harzianum (FK228), Trichoderma sp. (FK247) and Trichothecium roseum (FK238) providing control equivalent to that of the fungicides NP-1 and Diffusol for portions of the trial. Trichoderma sp. (FK247) and Trichothecium roseum (FK238) gave sapstain control in excess of 90% for the first 30 days of the timber trial equalling the control provided by NP-1 and Diffusol. In another trial, Trichoderma harzianum (FK228) was more effective than NP-1, providing 60% sapstain control, after six months, on the internal tissue of Pinus radiata logs. The six isolates selected for the field trials were examined in additional studies. In a dual inoculation study, Trichoderma sp. (FK247) exhibited localised antibiotic ability causing the lysis of mycelium of sapstain fungi. There was no evidence of mycoparasitic action by any of the six isolates. Trichoderma harzianum (FK228), Trichoderma sp. (FK247) and Trichothecium roseum (FK238) were observed to degrade cellulose. However, neither these nor the other isolates caused a significant change in the mechanical properties of Pinus radiata timber when compared to untreated controls. Decreasing pH or the addition of nitrate were identified as having potential for the promotion of biological control agent growth. The potential of mixed biological control agent inoculations was also examined. While these results are preliminary, they are extremely encouraging and provide a basis from which future studies can develop.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2474</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gas transport and storage processes in the lacunar system of Egeria densa Planch.</field><field name="creator">Sorrell, Brian.</field><field name="description">Aquatic macrophytes possess an internal lacunar system of proliferated intercellular airspaces. Lacunar gas exchange processes were investigated in Egeria densa Planch., a submerged freshwater angiosperm. Investigations of oxygen exchange between Egeria shoot segments and the water revealed that up to 17% of the photosynthetically-produced oxygen is retained within the lacunae. A consequence of this partitioning, which results from the relatively low solubility of oxygen in water, is the development of internal lacunar pressures up to 20 kPa above atmospheric pressure. This storage of oxygen in Egeria casts doubts on oxygen-based measurements of productivity in aquatic macrophytes, unless both internal and external sinks are monitored. Pressurisation also revealed that storage is greater in static water than in flowing water, suggesting that boundary layer limitations to oxygen transfer can also affect partitioning. Pressures fall to sub-atmospheric values in the dark, due to respiratory consumption of the internal oxygen. The Egeria respiratory gas exchanges in the dark demonstrated a steady concentration gradient between plant and water within an hour of darkening. However, the material steadily consumes approximately 30% of its respired oxygen from the lacunae, rather than the water. This oxygen supply is again due to the low oxygen solubility. The lacunae also assist the radial oxygen supply into the respiring tissue; it was found that the Michaelis-Menten constant for the respiratory response to oxygen tension in Egeria was some two to three times greater in material with infiltrated lacunae than in uninfiltrated material. Oxygen storage in the stem lacunae resulted in a longitudinal (shoot to root) movement of this gas, which was monitored using a bicompartment apparatus. The root oxygen release rate varied with light intensity and water flow rate in a similar manner to the internal pressure changes. Further experiments, involving measurements of the oxygen flux rates in the Egeria rhizosphere, demonstrated that this root oxygen loss is capable of effecting substantial diurnal oxygen fluctuations in the surrounding sediment. These processes may be interrupted by natural infiltration of the airspaces, but the factors involved here remain uncertain. The mean internal oxygen transport rate in Egeria (6.28 &#956;102 h-1) was consistent with estimates of lacunar oxygen concentration gradients calculated from Fick's Law, suggesting that diffusion is the oxygen transport mechanism in Egeria. However, by connecting shoots into manometers, internal pressure gradients of some 0.9 kPa m-1 were detected. These gradients were 103 -fold greater than the pressure gradient required to account for oxygen transport in Egeria, but were transient features, as the pressure equilibrated throughout the lacunar system 20 - 30 minutes after a dark/light change. Mass flow was therefore proposed as a transitory, but potentially significant, contribution to oxygen transport. Root to shoot carbon dioxide transport was measured using 14CO2 tracing. The CO2 uptake (mean internal transport = 4.96 &#956;1CO2 h-1) represented &lt;10% of the total carbon fixed; the concentration of root-derived carbon in shoot tissue declined rapidly from the root insertion point. These results are compared with those of previous studies, and the significance of the Egeria lacunar system assessed.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2475</field></doc><doc><field name="title">X-ray structural studies of selected group VIII metal complexes</field><field name="creator">Marsden, Karen</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the single crystal x-ray analyses of six novel organometallic osmium complexes and three complexes of the tridentate dentate ligand 1,6-bis(diphenylphosphino)-trans-hex-3-ene with the transition metals iridium, rhodium and ruthenium. The complexes of carbon monosulphide and carbon monotelluride with osmium, OsCl2(CO)(CS)(PPh3)2 and OsCl2(CO)(CTe)(PPh3)2, exhibit linear thio- and telluro-coordination similar to that of the carbonyl. The -CS and -CTe ligands exert strong trans-bond weakening influences. In the dihapto-thioacyl complex of osmium, Os(&#951;1-o2CCF3)[C(S)-(p-tolyl)](CO)(PPh3)2, the bidentate thioacyl is coordinated to the osmium through the carbon and sulphur atoms. This bonding involves a considerable degree of &#960;-interaction between the C, S and Os atoms, concomitant with a lengthening of the C-S bond. The dichlorocarbene complex, OsCl2(CO)(CCl2)(PPh3)2 is disordered in the crystalline state. Consequently, while the presence of the dichlorocarbene is verified, no unambiguous conclusions can be drawn from the associated geometry. In the carbyne complex of osmium, Os(C-p-tolyl)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2, the osmium is in a trigonal bipyramidal environment with an approximately linear arrangement of the Os-C-R group. The Os-Ccarbyne bond is short (corresponding to a bond order of ca. 3), confirming the formation of the C-p-tolyl group as a carbyne. The formaldehyde ligand in the osmium complex, Os(&#951;2-CH2O)(CO)2(PPh3)2, is bonded to the osmium centre via both the carbon and oxygen atoms. The C-O bond of the formaldehyde lengthens considerably upon coordination, resulting in a bond order apparently less than 1. Also present in the crystal structure are molecules of water which are hydrogen bonded into pairs (O&#8230;O separation 2.56 &#197;). The (H2O)2 units do not hydrogen bond to any other atoms, but rather occupy hydrophobic interstices in the structure. The three complexes of 1,6-bis(diphenylphosphino)-trans-hex-3-ene, (BDPH), IrIIICl3(BDPH), RhIIICl3(BDPH), and RuIICl2(CO)(BDPH) are isomorphous. The ruthenium complex is, however, disordered in the crystalline state. In each of the three structures the olefin of the BDPH moiety is only weakly bound to the metal, leaving the C-C double bond virtually unchanged from that of the free ligand. The olefin exerts a stronger trans-bond weakening influence than do the chlorine ligands in these complexes.</field><field name="date">1981</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2477</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Circadian organization in the regulation of locomotor activity and reproduction in Rattus exulans</field><field name="creator">Gander, Philippa H.</field><field name="description">The role of the circadian time-keeping system in regulation of locomotor activity and certain aspects of reproduction has been investigated in wild Polynesian rats, Rattus exulans. Locomotor activity is under circadian control and data are consistent with a general model of the pacemaker mechanism as a weakly interacting population of circadian oscillators. Experimental studies and field observations indicate that the action of light in entrainment of this rhythm is primarily non-parametric. Female R. exulans continue to ovulate during prolonged periods in constant conditions and undergo a pattern of change in vaginal cytology through the estrous cycle which closely resembles that of laboratory R. norvegicus. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the estrous cycle in R. exulans is regulated by a similar circadian mechanism to that controlling the timing of ovulation, and hence the duration of estrous cycle, in laboratory rats. Female R. exulans do not exhibit regular fluctuations in either the period of the activity rhythm or intensity of the active phase in association with the estrous cycle. Ovariectomy also has no significant effect on the period of the activity rhythm and no discernible effect on the distribution or intensity of activity. It is therefore concluded that there is no feedback action of the ovaries or estradiol on the circadian pacemaker regulating locomotor activity in R. exulans, which thus differs from laboratory rodents. This proposition is further supported by the observation that there are no significant changes in either period or variability of the activity rhythm in association with the degenerative changes that occur in the female reproductive system in old age. The adaptive significance of these findings is considered. Field studies on breeding patterns of R. exulans throughout its distribution provide several lines of indirect evidence in support of the hypothesis that the onset of breeding in this species in temperate latitudes is regulated by seasonal changes in photoperiod. Accelerated attainment of puberty occurs in juvenile females collected during the non-breeding part of the year and housed in LD 16:8. Juvenile females collected at the same times but housed in LD 8:16 for an identical duration remain immature. Groups of mature females collected during the breeding season do not show a differential response to these light regimes. These results are discussed in relation to field data on breeding patterns in the population from which experimental animals were collected. It is concluded that the onset of breeding in this population is controlled primarily by a photoperiodic mechanism regulating the attainment of reproductive maturity in females. Information on the physiological organization of circadian systems in mammals is reviewed, with particular emphasis on the relationships between locomotor activity rhythms, the estrous cycle, and the effects of photoperiod on reproductive function in rodents.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2479</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of the life cycle, biological performance and quality of the black lyre leafroller 'Cnephasia' jactatana (Walker)</field><field name="creator">Ochieng'-Odero, James Patrick</field><field name="description">The thesis answers the general question of whether the quality of artificially reared insect species should be based on performance tests for intended use or whether quality should be based on a more holistic biological approach. The empirical research is carried out using the lepidopteran leafroller 'Cnephasia' jactatana (Walker). The thesis defines biological performance and quality in terms of the success of an insect population in survival and reproduction and regards the laboratory environment as an artificial habitat that insects must colonise in order to survive and reproduce. Changes in biological performance that occurred during 12 successive generations of laboratory rearing were due to selection, acclimatisation and domestication and not adaptation. Artificial colonisation is theoretically successful within a limited range of environmental factors. As the inherent genetic variability of the founder population determines the resilience of the population to changes in performance, the ranges of environmental factors during colonisation should be wide to 'capture' much of the variability. Using body size (weight) as an aspect of overall quality, the thesis presents evidence that the final instar larva of C. jactatana has a threshold mechanism (larval critical weight, LCW) that determines pupal and adult size. There is a proportionate decrease in weight from the maximum weight that a larva attains in the final instar (LMW) to pupa ( described as constant DP ) and to adult (DA). There is a direct relation between the latent feeding period (period between attaining an LCW and LMW), LMW, pupal and adult size, and the reproductive performance (fecundity ). Within the experimental conditions diet quality, temperature, photoperiod and artificial selection had no effect on the larval critical weight, DP or DA, the larval threshold mechanism in C. jactatana is probably a mechanical trigger that initiates pupation. Diet quality, temperature and thermophotoperiods affected pupal size, adult size and reproductive performance. Photoperiod had no significant effects on size and reproductive performance. Positive assortative selections for slow development and low pupal weight significantly decreased pupal and adult size, and reproductive performance. Selection for fast development and heavy pupal weight for three generations had no significant effect on size or reproductive performance. Larval critical weight is demonstrated as useful to define quality indices and predict the performance of laboratory reared insects. The general conclusion of the thesis is that insect quality should be defined more in terms of the success in survival and colonising ability rather than solely on the success for 'intended role' or 'fitness for use'.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2480</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Detection of a signal as a function of interaural differences in the intensity of masking noise</field><field name="creator">Stillman, Jennifer A.</field><field name="description">A series of experiments was undertaken to explore the effect of interaural differences in the intensity of masking noise upon the detection of a signal. The signal was a 2-kHz sinusoid, and the masker was composed of either one or two 800-Hz wide bands of noise. The centre frequencies of the two bands of noise, one above and one below the signal frequency, were varied. On most occasions both noise bands were used to create a spectral notch surrounding the signal. The following factors were manipulated: (1) The width of the notch: from 0 to 1900 Hz. (2) The location of the lower and upper frequency edges of the notch relative to the signal: either equidistant from the signal, or with one edge 150 Hz nearer to the signal than the other edge. (3) The spectrum level of the noise: either 20, 35 or 50 dB SPL. (4) The degree of interaural disparity in the intensity of some components of the noise: either 0 dB, 10 dB or infinite. (5) The ear to which a particular masking noise was sent. (6) The manner in which the noise was presented: either diotically or dichotically. (7) The manner in which the signal was presented: either diotically or monotically. The results of the first two experiments were interpreted as showing that threshold signal levels in the presence of interaural differences in the intensity of masking noise depended principally on the ear in which the signal-to-masker ratio at the output of the auditory filter was larger. To test this possibility, auditory filter shapes were derived from two listeners. These were then used to predict thresholds when there were interaural differences in the spectral envelope of a masking noise. The results of a comparison between the predicted and obtained thresholds were consistent with the previous interpretation. Thus it appears that the detector following the filter can discriminate the output of the two ears and base detection on the better output. This ability may be useful in normal listening, where both wanted and extraneous sounds are subject to change from moment to moment.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2481</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transcriptional promoters in a replication region of F plasmid</field><field name="creator">Kennedy, Martin A.</field><field name="description">This thesis describes aspects of genetic regulation within and near a replication origin (ori-1) of the F plasmid.

The principal techniques employed in these investigations were: "shotgun" molecular cloning of restriction fragments into a galactokinase-based promoter selection vector, assays for galactokinase activities, DNA sequencing and S1 nuclease mapping of transcripts. Major findings from this study can be summarized as follows: 1). Promoters for the essential replication genes pifC and E were cloned and shown to be autoregulated at the transcriptional level. 2). An E.coli protein, integration host factor (IHF), was found to modulate the activity of the pif operon promoter. 13). Two promoters which direct transcription in opposite directions from within the minimal ori-1 region were discovered. 4). Transcription from both ori-1 promoters was shown to be repressed by the mini-F encoded D protein. 5). Precise transcriptional startsites of the pifC gene and the two ori-1 promoters were determined. 6).

It was found that chromic acid oxidation of ring-A aromatic steroids substituted with a strong electron-donating group, gives rise to products with the site of oxidation being predominantly that para to the activating group. Thus C-3 methoxy ring-A aromatic steroids give the corresponding 9b-hydroxy-11-oxo and 9-oxo-9,11-seco-11-oic acid derivatives as the major products and the 6-oxo derivative as a minor oxidation product. However, a ketol was not formed if a C-3 methoxy ring-A aromatic steroid also contained a substituent at C-1. The C-1-methoxy-4-methyl ring-A aromatic steroids give the 4-carboxy derivative as the major product and again the 6-oxo compound as a minor neutral product. The acetoxy and methyl substituted ring-A aromatic steroids, however, all give rise to the 6-oxo derivatives as the major products. The usual oxidation product of a ring-A aromatic steroid is therefore the 6-oxo product unless it is substituted with a methoxy group in a position which will stabilise an electron deficiency at a site other than C-6. Oxidation will then occur predominantly at the stabilised site unless it is sterically blocked.</field><field name="date">1969</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2484</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on Nucleic Acids in Relation to Protein Synthesis</field><field name="creator">Baguley, Bruce C.</field><field name="description">Several methods for the fractionation of transfer RNA have been investigated.

This is accomplished with a two-stage examination of case studies on the China-New Zealand joint ventures in China, involving two case studies in the first stage and one case study in the second stage. The exploratory and narrative research aims to aid theory building in the area of assessment and determination for IJV performance. In an investigation of the case IJVs between the Chinese and New Zealand firms, the study results in the development of three conceptual models of IJV performance and network relationships, namely, the Static Goal Model, the Goal Succession Model, and the Goal Emergence Model. These conceptual models adopt goal attainment as the criterion for assessing UV performance, and address goal attainment from a dynamic perspective by using a network approach. The theoretical models are illustrated and supported by the empirical evidence from the longitudinal case studies. The conceptual models differ from existing models of IJV performance in a number of important aspects, and thus contribute to theory relating to IJV performance in the following ways. These models integrate the concepts from the three research areas of performance, governance structure and dynamic evolution into a conceptual framework addressing IJV performance. Two types (organisational and interpersonal) of IJV network relationships are identified, and complex multiple tiers of network relationships in each type and their influence on JV performance and evolution are discussed. The study highlights the influence of network relationships and their evolution on IJV performance by arguing that IJV performance hinges on whether a trend of institutionalising the mechanism of trust building and conflict resolution and of balancing the network relationships within the IJV arrangement emerges from the process of IJV dynamic evolution.

Ascochytula obiones (Jaap) Died., the type species of Ascochytula, is considered to be congeneric with Ascochyta pisi Lib., the type species of the earlier genus, Ascochyta Lib. Ascochytula is thus reduced to synonymy with Ascochyta. Of the thirty-six species and two varieties named in, or directly associated with, Ascochytula, twenty are herein described as species of Ascochyta and four are excluded from Ascochyta. The remaining species were either not examined, or are nomina dubia. The following names are proposed: Ascochyta asparagina (Petrak) comb. nov., A. deformis (P. Karsten) comb. nov., A. dorycnii (Petrak) comb. nov., A. ludwigiana (Petrak) comb. nov., A. moravica (Petrak) comb. nov., A. obiones (Jaap) comb. nov., A. phlomidicola nom. nov., and A. ulicis (Grove) comb. nov. Ascochytella Tassi, which has often been confused with Ascochytula, is also synonymised with Ascochyta. The original thirteen species in Ascochytella were examined, and A. vicina (Sacc.) Tassi chosen as the lecto-type species. Most of the thirteen species are regarded as being either misplaced in Ascochytella, or nomina dubia, and only four, including the lectotype, are accepted as species of Ascochyta. The name, Placodiplodia canthiifolia (Cooke &amp; Massee) comb. nov. is proposed. The type species of Ascochyta, and of six related genera, Ascochytulina Petrak, Coniothyrium Corda. Diplodina Westend., Pseudodiplodia (P. Karsten) Sacc., Scolecosporiella Petrak, and Stagonospora (Sacc.) Sacc. were studied to determine the distinctions between these six genera and Ascochyta. Microdiplodia Allescher and Diplodia Fr. are also discussed, in relationt to Ascochyta. Ascochyta paspali (H. Sydow) Punith. (&#8801; Ascochytula paspali H. Sydow), which causes a leaf stripe disease of Paspalum dilatatum Poir., an important perennial grass of northern North Island pastures, was examined in detail. At some temperatures, under controlled climate conditions, the fungus significantly reduced the yield of P. dilatatum. A. paspali was found to grow systemically, as mycelium within the xylem vessels, and was able to infect all parts of the plant, including the roots and seeds. Green leaves sometimes became infected systemically without production of visual symptoms. Infected seed is suggested as a means for disease spread. No teleomorph for A. paspali was found, and the fungus is thought to over-winter in the dormant grass. The seasonal fluctuation in levels of P. dilatatum and of the disease was studied in two Northland pastures with paspalum as a component. One pasture was studied for fourteen months, and the other for four months. Disease levels, and paspalum levels, were determined by point quadrat analysis and by sorting of randomly cut samples. Levels of both the host and of the disease peaked in summer, while both were at low levels, or apparently absent, over the winter months.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2487</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Judgement as play: revealing analogies between aesthetics and ethics</field><field name="creator">Kovach, Vanya</field><field name="description">This thesis is about the similarities of process between aesthetic experience and ethical judgement. I claim that in both cases the activity is best described as a type of play in which elements interact in mutual adjustment and transformation. This conception of play has its roots in Kant's aesthetic theory. Describing aesthetic experience as play results in emphasis on three central characteristics. These characteristics become the basis of constraints on judgement. In the case of ethical judgement these are important because they save from subjectivism a moral theory, particularism, which relies on individual judgement rather than moral rules. Seeing the activity of judgement as play suggests a conception of the outcome of judgement as picturing. This conception helps to make sense of reason-giving within the particularist model. A further analogy with the grounds of aesthetic qualities is used to illuminate the problem of justifying the values put into play. These values are ultimately defended in terms of their relationship to human flourishing. Perennial problems for theories based on human flourishing are avoided by my account because prescriptions for action are not derived from the characterisation of flourishing but from the process of individual judgement which values based on flourishing merely inform. One positive effect of adopting my model of judgement as play is the reduction of problems concerning the motivation to act on ethical judgements.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::440000 Philosophy and Religion::440100 Philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2488</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Geography of Contemporary Maori Agriculture</field><field name="creator">Ishida, Hiroshi</field><field name="description">Hypothesis. In little more than a century a transformation has occurred in Maori agriculture. Before 1840, most Maori agriculture could best be described as shifting cultivation. The existence of this form of cultivation in Maori life can be indicated by such terms a Tohea Whenua which means a field exhausted by cultivation and Oneone hou which signifies new soil. In this system the sweet potatoe (Ipomea batatus)was the major crop. Apart from the dog, no other animals were kept. Today shifting cultivation in its technical sense is non-existent and Maori agriculturists are mostly commercial pastoral farmers, keeping dairy cows and sheep. The production of dairy produce and of other pastoral products by the Maori who form 7 percent of the population, is not a very significant proportion of the New Zealand total. It is nevertheless of quite noticeable volume when compared on a world basis with the total output of pastoral production in many other countries. The number of Maori holding in 1959-1960 was 5,227.</field><field name="date">1966</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::269900 Other Earth Sciences::269901 Physical geography</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2489</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Politics of insects: discipline and resistance in the cinema of David Cronenberg</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Scott Alexander</field><field name="description">This dissertation examines the films of David Cronenberg which all conduct a consistently thorough examination of the relationship between the ideologically constituted Cartesian subject and the disciplinary structures that surround, control and limit this subject. Cinema, because of the presence of both film form and narrative content, functions as a double articulation of this disciplinary activity. Each film&#8217;s narrative disciplines, on screen, the bodies contained within the plot, even as each film&#8217;s form disciplines both the way in which these cinematic bodies are delivered to an audience, and the way the audience&#8217;s own viewing practices are controlled and composed. Thus it becomes vital to explore the mechanisms implicated in these processes, and to gain an understanding of how Cronenberg&#8217;s cinema works to highlight and critique them. The primary assertion of this thesis is that Cronenberg&#8217;s work functions as a particular style of resistance to hegemony that Slavoj &#381;i&#382;ek labels&#8216;heresy&#8217;. For &#381;i&#382;ek,heresy occurs not when one disobeys one&#8217;s ideological requirements, but when one over-fulfills them, thereby extending these ideological demands and disciplinary discursive structures out to a site of logical absurdity. In assessing and charting this territory, the thesis is constructed in the following manner. The first chapter,which outlines my methodology, applies itself to a brief examination of Cronenberg&#8217;s least discussed commercial feature (Fast Company). Chapter Two is concerned with charting the disciplines applied to the body in Shivers, Rabid and The Fly, while Chapter Three continues a focus on Cronenberg&#8217;s movement and play with framing devices as a means of subverting a stable spectatorial position, utilising eXistenZ, Spider and The Dead Zone as examples. Chapter Four explores the manner with which heretical adherence to a single ideological construction pushes the protagonists towards large-scale disciplinary violations, as detailed in Crash, M. Butterfly and Dead Ringers while the fifth chapter examines notions of discipline and recuperation is focused on Naked Lunch, Scanners and The Brood. A final sixth chapter compares Cronenberg&#8217;s most recent film, A History of Violence, with Videodrome in order to explore the changing face of his disciplinary ambivalence and its relationship to a broader cinematic industry.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cinema</field><field name="subject">Psychoanalysis</field><field name="subject">David Cronenberg</field><field name="subject">Slavoj Zizek</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2500</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Detection and choice</field><field name="creator">Alsop, Brent Llewellyn.</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2491</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies with organoruthenium complexes of substituted arenes</field><field name="creator">Coulson, Sally Anne.</field><field name="description">The modified reactivity observed when a substituted arene is complexed to a cycIopentadienylruthenium moiety has been exploited to prepare a range of synthetically interesting target molecules. Activation of nitrogen- and halogen- substituted arenes has been achieved by compIexation to the cyclopentadienylruthenium moiety. Double nucleophilic substitution reactions between substituted (7 6- 1,2-dichlorw benzene)RuCp+ salts and substituted 1,2-benzenediols were carried out under mild conditions to prepare substituted (q6-dibenzodioxin)ruthenium complexes. Both mono- and di-substituted dibenzodioxin complexes were prepared. The dibenzodioxin ligands were subsequently liberated by photolysis. The complexation of a range of substituted benzimidazoles to the cyclopentadienylruthenium moiety has been studied. Several complexes were isolated and structures proposed. The metal moiety has been used to influence the stereoselection achieved in the reduction of carbonyl substituted arenes. A number of keto-arene complexes were prepared and reduced with sodium borohydride. The resulting alcohol complexes were characterised and the observed diastereoselectivity rationalised. Yanovsky-like adducts were prepared by nucleophilic addition to the cationic ruthenium salts to produce neutral (n5-cyclohexadienyl)ruthenuim complexes.

Principal works are of overseas origin; no substantial research has been published relating specifically to the New Zealand economy. This study does not attempt to develop a comprehensive theory of inflation, but has as its purpose the formulation of a simultaneous equation model to explain and predict movements in variables relevant to the inflationary process. The research has been conducted with New Zealand data and no econometric work on inflation yet published seems to have produced a model as embracing as the one advanced. This introduction has the following scope and content. First it conveys some idea of the extent of debate over what inflation is, this being done by brief references to various attempts at defining the phenomenon and to some of the different types of inflation advanced. Next, it questions more fundamentally 'what inflation is, and how, if' at all, the subject may be enlightened by further research. This leads on to derivation of an appropriate definition of inflation. Finally, an outline is given of the aspects of inflation to be investigated and the approach to be adopted.</field><field name="date">1971</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2493</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population structure of Southern Hemisphere humpback whales</field><field name="creator">Olavarria, Carlos</field><field name="description">The humpback whale was almost driven to extinction by commercial whaling in the Southern Ocean. Little is known about the degree of interchange among the remaining Southern Hemisphere populations. This thesis aimed to assess the connectivity among breeding grounds, feeding areas and migratory corridors of humpback whales using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers. The population structure of humpback whale populations in breeding grounds across the South Pacific and eastern Indian oceans was investigated, with an interest in the origins of whales in eastern Polynesia, using an extensive collection of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences (n = 1,112; 470 base pairs in length). Samples were obtained from living whales at six breeding grounds: New Caledonia, Tonga, Cook Islands, French Polynesia (Society Islands), Colombia and western Australia. We found significant differentiation, at both the haplotype and nucleotide level, among the six breeding grounds (FST = 0.033; &#934;ST = 0.022) and for most pair-wise comparisons. The differentiation of the eastern Polynesia humpback whales is consistent with the hypothesis of a relic subpopulation, rather than vagrancy or colonization from known neighbouring breeding grounds. Regardless of their origin, it seems probable that islands of eastern Polynesia are now the primary breeding grounds for humpback whales feeding in the management Area VI (170&#176;W &#8211; 120&#176;W) of the Antarctic, as defined by the International Whaling Commission. A population of humpback whales migrates along the western South American coast, with breeding grounds mainly off Colombia and Ecuador and feeding areas off the western coast of the Antarctic Peninsula and in the channels and fjords ofsouthern Chile. We analysed the genetic relationship between humpback whales from these two summer feeding areas of the eastern South Pacific population to assess the potential heterogeneity in the migratory pattern of the population. We compared mitochondrial DNA control region sequences from 132 whales from the Antarctic Peninsula and 52 whales from the Magellan Strait areas. An AMOVA showed significant differences between the two feeding areas (FST = 0.180; &#934;ST = 0.169). A phylogenetic analysis showed both areas are represented in the AE clade that is only found in the Southern Hemisphere in the Colombian breeding ground. Genetic and previous demographic data (based on photo-identification) strongly suggest that both feeding areas are related to the same breeding ground but that heterogeneity exists among the feeding areas of this population, similar to that observed in the North Pacific and North Atlantic populations of humpback whales.Humpback whales migrating through eastern Australia and New Zealand have been linked with those breeding off northeastern Australia, New Caledonia, Fiji and Tonga, forming a single stock (Breeding Stock E). We investigated the relationship between the New Caledonian and Tongan breeding grounds, based on interchange of individual whales (genetically identified) and population genetic differentiation (mitochondrial DNA control region sequences and nuclear DNA microsatellites). We found significantly higher recapture probabilities within each breeding ground compared to the recapture probability between them using genetic identification, and significant differences at the population level in the FST and &#934;ST for mitochondrial and nuclear markers. These analyses suggest differentiation among the Breeding Stock E, supporting a proposed sub-stock division for New Caledonia (E2) and Tonga (E3). Historically, humpback whales off New Zealand coasts were caught during their migratory journeys between Antarctic feeding areas and tropical breeding grounds in the South Pacific. Here we investigated the genetic diversity of New Zealand humpback whales, comparing mitochondrial DNA control region sequence data with that from breeding grounds across the South Pacific (New Caledonia, Tonga, Cook Islands, French Polynesia and Colombia) and eastern Indian (western Australia) Oceans. We analyzed 30 samples collected around New Zealand, revealing 20 haplotypes. All haplotypes were found in New Caledonia and some were also found in other breeding grounds. New Zealand humpback whale haplotype diversity and nucleotide diversity were similar to those from the compared breeding grounds, but were significantly different at haplotype level from the Cook Islands, French Polynesia and Colombia breeding grounds. We found significant differences at haplotype level with the same three locations when a pair-wise AMOVA was performed. Three breeding grounds (western Australia, New Caledonia and Tonga) did not show significant differences at either nucleotide or haplotype levels. This genetic evidence and the available demographic data suggest a closer relationship of the New Zealand stock with New Caledonia and to a lesser extent with Tongan whales, supporting New Zealand as a primary migratory corridor for the humpback whales breeding in these western Pacific Islands.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2564</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fictionalising the facts : an exploration of the 'place' of Aotearoa/New Zealand in the post-war autobiographical fiction of Anna Kavan</field><field name="creator">Sturm, Jennifer</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2496</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ma&#772;ori tribal organisations and new institutional economics</field><field name="creator">Findlay, Marama</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the iwi (M&#257;ori tribal) organisations established in New Zealand in the 1980s and 1990s to manage resources being transferred as a result of Treaty of Waitangi settlements and the devolution of government services. The research has two objectives. Firstly, it aims to document iwi organisations&#8217; establishment and operation from the viewpoint of those working inside the organisations. Secondly, it compares insider perspectives with economic theories concerning the causes, consequences and development of economic institutions. To address the first objective, the research gathers qualitative data for three iwi organisations and uses these to construct case reports. An inductive comparison across cases finds that while the underlying motivation for creating the iwi organisations is a desire to live as M&#257;ori, the immediate stimuli are opportunities negotiated with government. Iwi are chosen, in preference to other M&#257;ori groups, because of their size and traditional status and organisational success is dependent on meeting the requirements of both members and external parties. To address the second objective, the research examines a number of theories from new institutional economics which assist understanding of the empirical findings. To adequately explain iwi organisations as a whole, however, and to assess the relative explanatory power of the theories, they must be connected into a single explanatory framework. The research constructs a framework using the concept of social capital, understood as the combination of all the socio-economic institutions operating to make collective action possible. The framework proposes that socio-economic institutions can have an influence and value independent of other forms of capital. Viewing new iwi organisations through the constructed theoretical framework casts them as intermediaries, managing relational contracts between tribal members and external parties. The relational contracts with members constitute bonding social capital and are characterised by informal institutions of high intrinsic value, considerable relationship-specific social capital, transferability across tasks but not persons, and a preference for voice over exit. Relational contracts with external parties are primarily instrumental in value and formal institutions play a significant role; they show variability in the importance of informal institutions, relationship-specific social capital, transferability and preference for exit over voice. The thesis presents an insider&#8217;s view of new iwi organisations and then translates this view into the concepts of new institutional economics. In doing so, it contributes to two discussions: first, on the appropriate way to understand new iwi organisations; second, on the appropriate way for new institutional economics to understand society&#8217;s economic institutions.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2498</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Proteomic biomarker discovery for preeclampsia</field><field name="creator">Atkinson, Kelly Rene LeFevre</field><field name="description">Preeclampsia is a serious multisystem complication of late pregnancy with adverse effects for mothers and babies.  Currently this disorder is diagnosed from clinical observations occurring late in the disease process.  Unknown factors in the maternal circulation, possibly released by the preeclamptic placenta, have been linked to the pathophysiological changes characteristic of the disorder.  The research in this thesis used proteomic techniques to identify putative preeclampsia biomarkers from two sources: secreted from a placental cell line undergoing differentiation, and directly sampled from the serum and plasma of women with late-onset preeclampsia. The first part of this research examined the secreted proteome of a placental choriocarcinoma cell line (BeWo) undergoing forskolin-mediated differentiation.  Development of serum-free culture techniques enabled analysis of these secreted proteins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE).  Statistical testing revealed the significant involvement of seven spots during this differentiation model, with VE-cadherin and matrix metalloproteinase 2 among the proteins identified. In the second part of this research, maternal serum and plasma proteins were compared from women with preeclampsia and healthy pregnant women.  Serum samples were analyzed using 2DE, and plasma was subjected to difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE).  Bioinformatic analysis of both datasets identified multiple spot clusters able to classify samples according to disease state.  Five of these serum proteins were differentially regulated in preeclampsia, including two isoforms of apolipoprotein E whose isoform-specific expression was confirmed using western blots.  Analysis of plasma from preeclamptic women identified six proteins, again including apolipoprotein E.  Proteins from both studies are linked to preeclampsia pathophysiology through lipid transport, complement, and retinol transport systems. The culture methods and secreted proteomic techniques developed in this work have uncovered proteins in a placental cell line and maternal serum and plasma that are associated with preeclampsia. These methods can be extended to any system where secreted proteins are of interest.  The differentially regulated proteins found in this study provide an important first step towards developing effective biomarkers for diagnosing and/or predicting preeclampsia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">proteomics</field><field name="subject">pregnancy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2565</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic identity and ecology of Bryde's whales in the Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Wiseman, Nicky</field><field name="description">Little long-term research has been conducted in the Hauraki Gulf on Bryde&#8217;s whales; the least studied baleen whale. This thesis investigates this population using photoidentification and sighting records obtained from boat-based opportunistic surveys and genetic analyses of samples from living and `stranded&#8217; whales. Samples from `stranded&#8217; Bryde&#8217;s whales have been collected since 1994 from the North Island of New Zealand. In addition, biopsy samples were collected from whales in the Hauraki Gulf. Fifty-two samples from `stranded&#8217; and biopsied Bryde&#8217;s whales identified 49 unique individuals using 12 polymorphic microsatellites. The sex ratio for both sample collection types were equal with 22 males : 23 females (the sex of four could not be determined). MtDNA D-loop analysis (~800 bp) identified the samples as being consistent with Balaenoptera brydei with 11 haplotypes defined by 16 variable sites. Comparisons with published sequences (373 bp) revealed three shared haplotypes between the North Pacific and Indian Oceans. However, an AMOVA (FST and &#934;ST) showed high levels of differentiation between these oceans, likely resulting from ancestral gene flow. Between March 2001 and February 2006, 1,102 boat-based surveys were conducted during which there were 1,059 sightings over 521 days of Bryde&#8217;s whales (including two birth-length calves) in the Gulf. Since whales with calves, were observed during all months this suggests that the Hauraki Gulf is an important area for breeding whales. The seasonal change in `trip encounter rate&#8217; indicated that some whales leave the Gulf for part of the year. Whales in the Gulf were observed in shallower (12.1 to 59.8 m) and cooler (12 to 24.5oC) water than has generally been reported elsewhere. Balaenoptera brydei corresponds to the form described in the offshore waters of the western North Pacific. In contrast, their habitat use in the Hauraki Gulf was more consistent with the `inshore&#8217; form from the coasts off South Africa.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2612</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hydrodynamic imaging by blind Mexican cave fish</field><field name="creator">Windsor, Shane</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted until 2010, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biomechanics</field><field name="subject">hydrodynamics</field><field name="subject">cave fish</field><field name="subject">Astyanax fasciatus</field><field name="subject">fluid dynamics</field><field name="subject">hydrodynamic imaging</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2572</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Whakataukii: Maori sayings</field><field name="creator">McRae, Jane.</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2502</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cognitive Support during Object-Oriented Software Development: The Case of UML Diagrams</field><field name="creator">Costain, Gay</field><field name="description">The Object Management Group (OMG) accepted the Unified Modelling Language (UML) as a standard in 1997, yet there is sparse empirical evidence to justify its choice. This research aimed to address that lack by investigating the modification of programs for which external representations, drawn using the UML notations most commonly used in industry, were provided. The aim of the research was to discover if diagrams using those UML notations provided the modifying programmer with cognitive support.  The application of the use of modelling to assist program modification was chosen as a result of interviews that were carried out in New Zealand and North America to discover how workers in the software industry used modelling, and if so, whether UML notation satisfied their needs. The most preferred UML diagrams were identified from the interviews. A framework of modelling use in software development was derived. A longitudinal study at a Seattle-based company was the source that suggested that program modification should be investigated. The methodology chosen for the research required subjects to modify two non-trivial programs, one of which was supplied with UML documentation. There were two aspects to the methodology. First, the subjects&#8217; performances with and without the aid of UML documentation were compared. Modifying a program is an exercise in problem solving which is a cognitive activity. If the use of UML improved subjects&#8217; performances then it could be said that the UML had aided the subjects&#8217; cognition. Second, concurrent verbal protocols were collected whilst the subjects modified the programs. The protocols for the modification with UML documentation, for ten of the more successful subjects, were transcribed and analysed according to a framework derived from the literature. The framework listed the possible cognitive steps involved in problem solving where cognition could be distributed to and from external representations. The categories of evidence that would confirm cognitive support were also derived from the literature. The experiments confirmed that programmers from similar backgrounds varied widely in ability and style. Twenty programmers modified both an invoice application and a diary application. There was some indication that the UML diagrams aided performance. The analyses of all ten of the transcribed subjects showed evidence of UML cognitive support.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2603</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bridge deck analysis</field><field name="creator">Buckle, I. G.</field><field name="description">In this thesis the structural analysis of two basic types of bridge deck systems are discussed: 1. the nmltibeam bridge deck II. the skewed anisotropic bridge deck. The major difficulty in the analysis of I, the multibeam deck, arises from its lack of transverse bending stiffness; load distribution occurs by shear transference at interlocking shear keys. An analysis method, developed from transfer matrix theory is proposed and shown to be satisfactory for such a structure. Model studies on a quarter scale multibeam bridge deck are described together with field tests on the prototype decks - the southern motorway bridges crossing Slippery Creek. Agreement between theory, model studies and field tests is illustrated. The satisfactory analysis of II, the skewed anisotropic deck, is complicated by its anistropic elastic properties and skewed geometry. An analysis procedure is introduced which is an extension of the finite element technique already established in other plate bending and plane stress problems. Using therefore the matrix displacement method and finite element discretization, the method has been programmed for solution by digital computer. Comparison of the computed displacements with those obtained by experiment on skewed isotropic and anisotropic steel plates is given. The finite element method is seen to be a powerful analytical tool, particularly because of its ability to handle elastic anisotropy and arbitrary geometric shapes.</field><field name="date">1968</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2525</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of coulomb damping on single and multidegree of freedom structures</field><field name="creator">Mayes, Ronald L.</field><field name="description">This study compares the effects of viscous and coulomb damping on the dynamic response of single and multidegree of freedom structures. It was found that coulomb damping was less effective than viscous damping in reducing the steady-state resonant amplitude of all non-linear structures when the steady-state amplitude was greater than two. Also, there is no single, simple relationship relating the amount of viscous damping to coulomb damping for equal resonant steady-state response of non-linear structures. For the earthquake excitation of the single-degree-of-freedom structure it was found that coulomb damping was less effective than viscous damping in reducing the velocity and displacement spectral response values for short period structures whereas for longer period structures coulomb damping was much more effective than viscous damping. Both forms of damping had a paradoxical effect on the acceleration response of non-linear structures in that an increase in damping generally causes an increase in the acceleration response. The closed solution of a multidegree of freedom structure with viscous and coulomb damping subjected to a sinusoidal forcing function is derived and used to obtain approximate values of viscous and coulomb damping from small amplitude vibration tests. It is clear from the results obtained that if coulomb damping is present in small amplitude vibrations of a structure then the concept of equivalent viscous damping will result in the structure being overdamped when subjected to an earthquake ground motion.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hydroelastic excitation of cylinders.</field><field name="creator">Small, Arthur Francis, 1946-</field><field name="description">The transverse vibration of a bluff body in a steady fluid flow is a phenomenon that has been observed and discussed through the ages. Named after the Greek God of Wind Aeolius, the Aeolian Tones, such as are emitted by the wind in telephone or power lines, were known to the Greeks, who produced musical sounds from an Aeolian Harp by hanging it in a current of wind. The first recorded association of the transverse vibration with a periodic wake pattern was made by Leonardo Da Vinci, who observed and sketched the process of alternate periodic vortex shedding from a bluff body to form the staggered vortex trail in its wake. It is unlikely that prior to the nineteenth century many structural failures occurred due to hydrodynamic excitation. Wood, stone and brick were the main construction materials, and the elementary design methods used were very conservative ensuring that the structure had high frequency, large mass and a large damping factor. A very high flow velocity was therefore needed to initiate structural oscillations by vortex shedding and, if initiated these structural oscillations would usually be quickly damped out. During the nineteenth century the rapid advancement in the art of civil engineering design and the introduction and development of concrete and steel as a construction material led to the design of streamlined structures with more economical dimensions and consequently lower frequencies, smaller masses and smaller damping factors. Although design codes made a reasonable allowance for static loadings, dynanic loadings caused by earthquakes and hydrodynamic excitation were eirther ignored or underestimated.</field><field name="date">1971</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2531</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Local scour at bridge sites</field><field name="creator">Melville, B. W.</field><field name="description">The problem of local scouring at a circular cylinder in sandy material under threshold conditions was investigated experimentally. The aim of the study was to obtain a better understanding of the mechanism causing scour. Three fixed-bed scour models were constructed: the initial flat-bed model, an intermediate scour model and the final equilibrium scour hole model. The experimental results have shown that although scour is initiated by the high local shear stresses which result from flow acceleration about the cylinder, the subsequent development of the scour hole is due to the establishment of a strong downflow ahead of the cylinder. The scour hole grows in the form of a frustrum of an inverted cone at a slope angle equal to the dynamic angle of repose of the bed material. Erosion occurs in the bottom part of the scour hole. Bed particles from the upper part of the hole slide down into the erosion area as the slope angle is increased by erosion of material from below. The equilibrium depth of scour is attained when the downflow becomes incapable of further erosion. For a particular bed material the downflow should be primarily a function of the mean approach flow velocity and cylinder diameter. Hence the study has shown that the equilibrium depth of scour should also be a function of these two parameters. Additional measurements have shown that the horseshoe vortex, which is initially small, roughly circular in cross-section, and comparatively weak, increases dramatically in size and strength as the scour hole forms. During the development of the scour hole, the horseshoe vortex expands and moves down into the hole, increasing its circulation throughout the scour process, but at a diminishing rate. The shape of the vortex follows that of the scour hole-cylinder combination. Measurements in the wake have added to existing information concerning the shedding and convection of wake vortices in shear flow. The results obtained are consistent with the occurence of span-wise cells of constant shedding frequency, separated at the discontinuities by longitudinal vortices. The vortices accelerate away from the cylinder at speeds initially less than the free stream but becoming constant and approximately equal to the free stream velocity at about 8  cylinder diameters downstream. Based upon a survey of existing material, a design recommendation for the estimation of local scour depths at bridge piers is also presented.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2537</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Viscoelastic response of polyethylene to temperature and pressure</field><field name="creator">Dao, Kim Chung, 1941-</field><field name="description">Specimens of high-density low-density polyethylene were uniaxially compressed at nominally constant strain-rates ranging from 0.000066 to 0.66 sec-1 at temperatures from 77&#176; to 350&#176;K and hydrostatic pressures from 0.001(latm) to 4 K bar. It was shown that there were significant effects of temperature, pressure and strain rate on both polyethylenes. At small strains (O.O1), the time-temperature and time-pressure superpositions were used successfully to construct the master curves of stress versus reduced strain-rate. These master curves, which were found to have been taken in the range of linear-viscoelastic behaviour of the polymers, were employed to derive the stress-relaxation moduli and the relaxation spectra. The viscoelastic response to temperature and pressure of high-density polyethylene in the transition zone between the &#947; and &#945; relaxations, and that of low-density polyethylene in the transition zone between the &#947; and &#946; relaxations have been found to be controlled by the same molecular motion. This motion, an Arrhenius-type activated process, was identified as involving molecular segments of six to eight carbon atoms with an activation energy of 22 Kcal/mole and an activation volume of 110 cm3/mole.</field><field name="date">1971</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2530</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Digital data processing in radio astronomy</field><field name="creator">Apperley, Mark David</field><field name="description">Research in radio astronomy at the University of Aucklan School of Engineering has been in progress for a period of six years. The program was initiated primarily to provide a variety of topics for post-graduate research in the Department of Electrical Engineering, and at the same time to develop a useful radio telescope installation. Initial work was concentrated on the development of antenna arrays (Lim, 1968) and low noise receivers at a frequency of 42MHz, utilising both phase-switched and correlation interferometer principles (Irving, 1966; Yarrall, 1968; Saunders, 1968). At the beginning of 1969, the Department moved from its former country site into the centre of Auckland city. As no alternative field site was available, the telescope was also moved, but space limitations meant that the city site was inadequate for any useful observations at 42MHz. It became clear that to utilise the site more fully a higher observation frequency would be necessary, and a frequency of 200MHz was chosen, as this was the upper limit of most of the available laboratory equipment, yet still within the range of semiconductor devices. In view of the inadequacies of the site, it was obvious that the performance of the system could be significantly improved by processing the output in a digital computer.</field><field name="date">1971</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2528</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mechanical properties of glassy poly (methyl methacrylate)</field><field name="creator">Meikle, John Boyd, 1940-</field><field name="description">The mechanical properties of glassy poly (methyl methacrylate) have been examined by means of constant strain-rate tests at differing strain-rates and temperatures.

It was aimed at elucidating the mechanisms of deformation, using optical microscopy to examine slip habits and transmission electron microscopy to examine dislocation substructures. Marked differences were observed in the stress/strain response, slip behaviour, and the substructural rearrangements of single crystals of &#946;-brass when widely different rates of uninterrupted compressive loading were used. Under static loading (strain rates = 10-4 sec-1) the crystals workhardened in a parabolic manner, slip being confined to either of the two (101) [111] or (211) [111] systems. Cross-slip in the statically deformed crystals was evidenced by the wavy appearance of the slip traces. Under dynamic loading (strain rates &gt; 103 sec-1) the crystals exhibited large yield drops followed by a linear rate of work-hardening which was lower than the static work-hardening rate. Slip on the four (-101) [111], (-110) [111], (101) [-11l] and (110) [-111] systems occurred simultaneously. The traces on any one dynamically deformed specimen were both coarser and finer than those observed on specimens statically deformed. The coarse traces belonging to a given {110} &lt;111&gt; slip system always bounded the finer traces of another {110} &lt;111&gt; system. No wavy slip was observed on the dynamically deformed specimens. The substructures present in the statically deformed crystals were consistent with a single mode of slip and exhibited features indicative of high rates of hardening on the active slip planes. The important features of the statically induced substructures were as follows:- (a) There was a predominance of dislocations with Burgers vectors of a[111]. Many of these lay in non-screw high-energy orientations, consistent with the occurrence of cross-slip and the observed high hardening rates of the crystals. (b) Strong tangling developed on the slip planes as a result of a[111] edge segments interacting with other a[111] segments and with loop and dipole debris produced on the slip planes. (c) A partially developed cell structure resulted from this tangling. The dynamically induced substructures were consistent with the simultaneous operation of the four {110} &lt;111&gt; slip systems. It was inferred from the substructural investigations that the lower rates of hardening in the dynamically deformed crystals arose from the distribution of slip over the four systems with a consequent reduction in hardening on each individual system. The interactions between dislocations on intersecting slip planes appeared to be less important in contributing to hardening than the influence of the four systems in reducing the hardening on any one system. A series of interrupted tests indicated that behaviour under staticstatic, dynamic-dynamic and dynamic-static loading sequences was consistent with the uninterrupted static and dynamic behaviour, but that the dynamic reload stress/strain and slip behaviour, and the associated substructural changes were greatly modified by static preloading. The crystals deformed by a "static" type slip mechanism, but exhibited "dynamic" type stress/strain behaviour during the dynamic reload in this sequence.</field><field name="date">1971</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2529</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multivariate analysis of non-linear hydrologic systems</field><field name="creator">Bidwell, V.

M.</field><field name="description">An investigation is made into the coupled lateral-torsional response of torsionally unbalanced &#8220;shear&#8221; buildings to horizontally directed earthquake excitation. Attention is confined to analytical models that have linearly elastic, viscously damped responses. The investigation involves three separate analyses: Firstly, in a preliminary study, the earthquake response of an asymmetric single storey building model is analyzed and general expressions are derived for the location of the centre of stiffness and the orientation of the principal axes. Secondly, an analysis is made of the coupled lateral-torsional response of a partially symmetric single storey building model to a single component of earthquake excitation. A modal solution of the two equations of motion is developed and a general criterion is derived for the existence of full modal coupling. By employing the design spectrum concept, together with conservative rules for the combination of modal maxima, analytical results in dimensionless form are evaluated for an equivalent static shear and an equivalent static torque. The combination expressions are then modified to include an allowance for modal coupling before the final results are computed and tabulated. The results substantiate previous findings which have pointed to a possible link between strong modal coupling and severely coupled lateral and torsional responses. In particular, they indicate that those nominally symmetric buildings which exhibit strong modal coupling are liable to respond more strongly in torsion than has hitherto been recognised by most building codes. This effect has not in the past been quantified in analytical terms. Although the results have practical applications in design, the analysis concerns itself primarily with the determination of realistic estimates for the dimensionless response quantities and no attempt is made to derive design rules. Finally, the partially symmetric single storey model is extended to a special class of partially symmetric multistorey "shear" buildings. The importance of this final analysis derives from the similarity between the results for the single storey model and those for the continuous multistorey model.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2547</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The simulation of water quality in the Waikato and Tarawera rivers.</field><field name="creator">Rutherford, J.

The equations governing the concentration of dissolved oxygen in a polluted waterway are developed and a review is made of the various finite difference schemes which available for solving them. Models are developed for predicting dissolved oxygen concentrations in two polluted New Zealand rivers, the Waikate and the Tarawera. It was found that the models used previously in other waterways were not adequate for either of these rivers. The model of the Waikato River uses the well-known Streeter-phelps equation to model the exertion of BOD but includes the effects of the macrophyte and phytoplankton communities on the concentration of dissolved oxygen. The model of the Tarawera River uses the Monod equations to predict the concentrations of active biomass in the porous pumice sediments on the river bed, and successfully accounts for the high rate of oxygen uptake which has been observed. The way in which these models could profitably be developed is also discussed.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2538</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The work-hardening behaviour of polycrystalline copper during interrupted tensile testing</field><field name="creator">Davies, Graeme John, 1937-</field><field name="description">The work described in this thesis represents the results of an investigation undertaken with the dual intention of (a) establishing the apparatus and techniques necessary for carrying out investigations into the work-hardening behaviour of metals under-going plastic deformation, and (b) examining the work-hardening behaviour of polycrystalline copper during interrupted tensile testing. The first part of the investigation required the development of the basic apparatus for investigations of the type envisaged. This apparatus included a tensile testing-machine, apparatus for the production of meta1 single crystals, apparatus for the determination of the orientation of metal single crystals and apparatus for the strain-free machining of metal single crystals. Details of the design and construction of this apparatus are presented. The second part of the investigation required the assessing of the existing knowledge of work-hardening and the establishment of a programme aimed at contributing further to this knowledge. A review is presented of information which pertains to the results of interrupted tensile tests such as those where the temperature dependence of the flow stress is examined, or the yield phenomenon produced by unloading is examined. Some omissions and anomalies in this information are noted and a programme of interrupted tests of the types described in the review is outlined for polycrystalline copper. As a result of this programme, the following conclusions are made concerning the work-hardening behaviour of polycrystalline copper during interrupted tensile testing: (a) polycrystalline copper obeys the Cottrell-Stokes law irrespective of the grain size or purity. (b) copper single crystals of polyslip orientations obey the Cottrell-Stokes law. (c) polycrystalline copper exhibits a yield phenomenon produced by unloading at all temperatures and strains. The magnitude of the change in flow stress associated with the yield phenomenon increases with decreasing temperature and is not significantly dependent on grain-size or purity. The magnitude of the change in flow stress increases with increasing strain and passes through a maximum. (d) the magnitude of the change in flow stress associated with the yield phenomenon produced by unloading in polycrystalline copper increases as the amount of unloading increases.</field><field name="date">1961</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2523</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the flow properties of New Zealand wood pulp suspensions</field><field name="creator">Duffy, Geoffrey G.</field><field name="description">One of the most important process operations in the pulp and paper industry is the transport of pulp in pipe lines. Because pipe friction losses are much higher than with water under comparable conditions, accurate design correlations for each pulp are important to the industry. The purpose of this investigation was to design and build a flow rig suitable for investigating a wide range of pulp conditions, to obtain pipe friction loss data for New Zealand pulps, and to produce design correlations and procedures for the industry. This thesis is therefore concerned primarily with describing the experimental equipment and procedures, presenting pipe friction loss data for a variety of New Zealand pulps, including a design correlation for them, and developing design methods for computing friction losses. It includes, in addition, data on drag reduction observed at high velocities of flow, and a discussion of flow mechanisms in each regime of flow. The equipment was designed to produce friction loss data from three pipe diameters simultaneously for each consistency of pulp. Flow rate was controlled without throttling the flow. Pipe friction loss data are presented for five Kraft pulps and one neutral sulphite semi-chemical pulp. Data were obtained from 1,2,3 and 4 in. diameter PVC pipes for a wide range of consistencies and flow rates up to 0.8 ft3/sec. Standard Lampen mill evaluations on hand sheets made from the pulps are presented, as well as data on the characteristics of the fibres. The Kraft pulps exhibited the characteristic maxima and minima but the semi-chemical pulp did not exhibit these turning points. For Kraft pulps head losses before the respective maxima were increased by refining the pulp and using rough pipe; and decreased by adding short-fibre Tawa and by drying and reslushing the pulp. In comparison with maxima for the unbeaten Kraft Pulp, the maxima of the head loss curves for all Kraft pulps were shifted to lower velocities by the above-mentioned operations. This would reduce the friction loss in many practical cases. In particular, rough pipe lowers the magnitude of friction loss in this regime, and can therefore yield a considerable economic advantage. A single design correlation for Kraft pulps is presented for the regime of flow before the maxima in the head loss curves. The limits of the correlation are given. Friction losses of New Zealand pulps were found to be lower than those previously reported in the literature. Two methods of design are presented for the regimes at velocities above the maxima in the head loss curves. A procedure is suggested for pulp and paper mills to obtain their own limits for the design correlation and to verify the correlation proposed in this investigation for their own pulps. A design correlation for the Tawa NSSC pulp is also presented. Mechanisms of flow are discussed for Kraft pulps and a semi-chemical pulp. Visual observations in an artificially roughened pipe for the regime of flow before the maxima of the head loss curves have confirmed fibre-wall contact in this regime. Data obtained at the first sign of permanent plug disruption have been correlated with data at the onset of drag reduction. Fully developed turbulence was found to occur at the maximum level of drag reduction. Some velocity profiles are reported for the transition regime using a modified annular-purge probe. In addition the disruptive shear stress of fibre networks has been correlated by three different methods. Data for the onset of drag reduction are presented and compared with data previously obtained from large diameter pipes from other investigations. This correlation is used as a method for designing piping systems at high flow rates.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2532</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stress-strain and strength properties of an Auckland residual soil</field><field name="creator">Meyer, V.

The study was concerned with an estimation of the maximum possible peak-to-peak amplitude of simple idealised models subjected to pulses of a sinusoidal nature. The study was mainly centred around the maximum response of the single degree of freedom elastoplastic system and the effect upon it of viscous damping and a transition region between the elastic and plastic states. The extension of the approach to the two degree of freedom elastoplastic system was also investigated. The study was undertaken within the context of the earthquake engineering field. The investigation shows up certain basic characteristics of the transient response of fully yielding structures which appear to be common for widely varying types of exciting function. It also shows that the response of fully yielding structures to earthquake motions is probably a function of the characteristics of the largest pulses of an earthquake. A brief review of the study of the inelastic response of structures in the earthquake engineering context is also presented.</field><field name="date">1965</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2524</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A new vision interface : "defining what instead of how" : making image analysis functions transparent to the user by coupling them to handling tasks in an intuitive interface for materials handling applications</field><field name="creator">Sly, Ian M. P.</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the need for adaptability in vision systems that measure system state information in a sensory feedback role for the control and coordination of flexible discreteitem materials handling operations, such as those performed by a robotic palletising system. In addition, this thesis addresses the need for vision systems that are more easily configured by users, such as factory technicians and operators, who have lower skill levels than those generally required to (re-)configure a machine vision system. In response, a unique coupling mechanism and intuitive human-computer interface have been developed, hiding the complexity of image analysis from the end-user and simplifying the way that a machine vision system is configured. The mechanism couples machine vision-related "visual checks&#8221; to materials handling tasks in a generic framework of materials handling activities. Visual checks which define what control information is required are implicitly linked to image analysis functions which define how that information is extracted from digitised images of a materials handling system. Consequently, this research has developed a set of task - visual check "building blocks" that can be used in various combinations to define the sequence of actions and image analysis required to perform a variety of materials handling operations. In addition, a number of pre-defined task &#8211; visual check combinations and mechanisms for manipulating them have been developed, providing solution templates that can be used immediately or modified to suit application-specific requirements. These developments have been realised together with several aesthetic, ergonomic and functional features in a machine vision configuration interface, known as SlyVision. SlyVision's modularity, extensibility and upgradeability expressed to both the end-user and the system developer through its underlying object oriented architecture and intuitive user interface design make important contributions to its overall adaptability. Demonstrations involving a typical palletising and a de-palletising operation have shown how SlyVlsion is used to specify visual checks and configure the associated machine vision components without requiring the end-user to select or apply image analysis techniques or functions. In addition, the relative simplicity of the configuration process is demonstrated. Consequently, these developments assist people with limited understanding of machine vision technology to set up and maintain a vision system, thereby improving their ability to keep pace with frequent changes in their materials handling operations, while limiting the cost in time, money and effort required to (re-)configure a vision system.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290500 Mechanical and Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2506</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of microstructure on the fracture toughness of a high strength steel</field><field name="creator">Clark, N. E.</field><field name="description">The relationship between heat treatment, microstructure, fracture topography and room temperature fracture toughness has been determined for a high strength low-alloy steel, En 25. 0ptical, transmission and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterize the structure and morphology while fracture toughness, notched impact and tensile tests were used to determine the mechanical properties. The as-quenched microstructure was predominantly autotempered lath martensite. A little retained austenite was observed in all as-quenched martensite. Austenitizing at 1200&#176;C instead of the conventional 850&#176;C resulted in a 30 percent increase in as-quenched fracture toughness with no loss in tensile strength. Step quenching from 1200 to 850&#176;C for 15 minutes before oil quenching resulted in embrittlement of the austenite grain boundaries and consequently a loss of fracture toughness. The superior fracture toughness of the coarse grain l200&#176;C material was maintained for tempers up to 200&#176;C. Severe intergranular embrittlement and a considerable reduction in toughness were observed when the coarse grain 1200&#176;C material was tempered in the 300-400&#176;C tempered martensite embrittlement range. The fine grain 850&#176;C material also exhibited a drop in toughness in the 300-400&#176;C tempering range but in this case the fracture mode was mainly transgranular cleavage. Transgranular cleavage fracture was tentatively associated with the precipitation of lath boundary cementite, Fe3C. Tempering the fine grain material above 400&#176;C eliminated cleavage and brittle intergranular fracture and resulted in a significant increase in toughness. A little brittle intergranular fracture was observed in the coarse grain material tempered at 500&#176;C. The transverse fracture toughness for material of yield strength less than 1200 MPa was controlled by the major MnS stringer population. The fracture profile was zig-zag, each peak or trough terminating at a MnS stringer. A shear fracture mechanism has been proposed to account for the observed zig-zag fracture mode. The longitudinal fracture toughness was significantly greater than the transverse fracture toughness for tempers of 400&#176;C and above. Mixed microstructures containing lower bainite and martensite did not have inferior relative toughness to wholly martensitic structures. Relationships were found between relative toughness and yield strength and relative toughness and shear lip thickness. There was no meaningful relationship between notched bar impact and fracture toughness data.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2543</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between fracture toughness and shear lip size</field><field name="creator">Lai, M.

The size of the shear lips, BSL, measured at the free surfaces of the specimens was found to be independent of the specimen thickness and to be related to the true plane strain fracture toughness, KIC, through the expression BSL = 0.41(KIC/&#963; ys)2.02, where &#963;ys is the 0.2% proof stress of the material. A rationale for this behaviour is that BSL is approximately equal to the size of the plane stress plastic zone, ry, at the surfaces of a plate specimen, which from theoretical analysis, has been shown to be rY = &#928;/8(KIC/&#963;YS)2. The ASTM standard plane strain fracture toughness test method has been proven to be insensitive to detect excess yielding in the specimens tempered at temperatures higher than 450&#176;C. At high tempers, yielding fracture mechanics approaches were used to determine the true KIC values. The fracture toughness versus shear lip size relationship is believed to have considerable importance in the analysis of service failures and in the preliminary study of specimen size effect in plane strain fracture toughness determination.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2546</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Semi-rigid joints for moment-resisting steel framed seismic-resisting systems</field><field name="creator">Clifton, George Charles, 1955-</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the development of new semi-rigid joints for moment-resisting steel framed (MRSF) seismic-resisting systems.

To meet economic criteria, the joints and systems were also required to be cost-effective to design, fabricate and construct when compared with conventional MRSFS. Four joint systems between the beams and columns of a MRSF were considered. These were the: Ring Spring Joint (RSJ), where the beams are clamped to the columns with flush endplates and compressible ring spring elements Post-tensioned Tendon Joint (PTJ), where the beams are post-tensioned onto the columns with post-tensioning technology Flange Bolted Joint (FBJ), where the beams are bolted to the columns through flange and web plates that are designed and detailed to undergo dependable cyclic extension and compression under inelastic rotation demand Sliding Hinge Joint (SHJ), where the beam is pinned to the column at the top flange level and is connected at the bottom flange and the bottom of the web by a unique asymmetrical sliding shear detail The RSJ, FBJ and SHJ were developed through to the experimental stage, with large-scale tests on representative joints undertaken. The FBJ and SHJ were further developed, through small-scale static and dynamic testing, finite element and numerical integration time-history analyses into fully designed and detailed systems. Design procedures and detailing requirements for the two fully developed systems are presented, together with details of experimental testing, finite element analyses of joint components and numerical integration time-history analyses of complete structural systems.

J.</field><field name="description">The investigation reported in this thesis was the initial phase of an experimental programme initiated in 1969 at Auckland University to study the application of hydrometallurgical techniques to the recovery of base-metals from New Zealand sulphide ores. The principal aim was to design and build a suitable autoclave for conducting pressure leaching experiments and with this to evaluate the sulphuric acid leaching kinetics of a bulk lead-zinc-copper-iron concentrate, under a range of experimental conditions that might have process potential. The effects of temperature, oxygen partial pressure, initial acid concentration, excess or deficiency of acid, initial particulate surface area, agitation, catalyst additions (cupric and ferric sulphate) and time on the rate of leaching of sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite and pyrite were investigated. Galena was found to dissolve with the formation of hydrogen sulphide and lead sulphate. The hydrogen sulphide inhibited the dissolution of both sphalerite and chalcopyrite but not galena. The effect of experimental variables on the rate of oxidation of hydrogen sulphide to sulphur are reported. This reaction was found to take place on the surface of sulphide particles between adsorbed species and the rate determining step was the oxidation of adsorbed ferrous ions by dissolved oxygen. Scanning electron micrographs are presented which show that the lead sulphate forms as a non-coherent crystalline layer on the galena surface. Conversion reaction kinetics were consistent with rate control by liquid phase diffusion in the pores of this layer. The rate of conversion was independent of oxygen partial pressure, initial acid concentration and hydrodynamics but was directly proportional to the initial particulate surface area. A very low temperature dependence was exhibited. Sphalerite was found to exhibit linear leaching kinetics up to extractions of eighty percent after reaction inhibiting hydrogen sulphide had been removed by oxidation. The rate of linear leaching was directly proportional to oxygen partial pressure and surface area but independent of acid concentration and hydrodynamics. The ultimate sulphide oxidation products were elemental sulphur and sulphate ions with the former usually accounting for over ninety percent of the reacted sulphide sulphur. The dissolution reaction producing sulphur was electrochemical in nature and the cathodic reaction involving the discharge of oxygen was found to be rate controlling. Soluble iron catalysed this reaction and a mechanism is proposed that involves the chemisorption of ferrous ions and dissolved oxygen at the mineral surface. Scanning electron micrographs are presented which show that certain crystal faces are preferentially attacked and that dissolution occurs by a pitting action. They also explain why sphalerite dissolution is severely curtailed at temperatures exceeding the meltinq point of sulphur. For extractions exceeding eighty percent the dissolution rate decreased rapidly due to a decrease in cathodic area and to the agglomeration of residues. Chalcopyrite and pyrite dissolved much more slowly than sphalerite and were extensively coated by elemental sulphur because the oxidation of hydrogen sulphide was catalysed on their surfaces. Some practical implications of the leaching results are discussed.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2539</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of UHF communications on overhead earth-wires in power transmission networks</field><field name="creator">Castle, N. J.</field><field name="description">The motivation for this research is a proposed UHF surface wave communication system in which the waveguides are the stranded, overhead earth wires of Power System transmission lines. Attention is confined largely to an investigation of certain aspects which affect the overall surfaces wave transmission loss, a full-scale system having been set up in the laboratory for experimental purposes. For the prediction of transmission loss the stranded conductor is assumed to be equivalent to a solid conductor of the same diameter but with surface anisotropy in the form of two mutually orthogonal surface impedances the major reactive component of which is attributed to the effects of the helical stranding. This reactance is determined from a consideration of the fields which are assumed to exist within the cavities between the strands, and externally. From a comparison between experimental and theoretical loss characteristics there is sufficient inducement to accept the anisotropic model of the stranded conductor for practical design purposes. Approximate equations are developed to simplify the calculation of transmission loss and the notion of &#8216;capture cross-section&#8217; is employed for the estimation of the efficiency of conical horn launchers. It is deduced from &#8216;sensitivity&#8217; relationships that the horn loss is relatively insensitive to small changes in the fictitious surface reactance representing the effects of helical stranding, which tends to justify the assumptions upon which the anisotropic model is based. On the other hand, variations in the helix angle are shown to have a marked effect upon the calculated horn loss. This influences the choice of the stranded conductor used as the waveguide for the experimental verification of the model. The Author&#8217;s experimental research is described at length, the principal objective being to establish the anisotropic model as an acceptable theoretical substitute for the stranded conductor. To reduce the horn loss, dielectric sheaths are ted to the waveguide in the vicinity of the horn apertures. The discrepancies which then appear between theory and experiment are attributed both to the scattering of the surface wave by the boundary discontinuities at the ends of the sheaths and to the anomalous behaviour of commercial-grade PVC dielectric. Considering the increase in the transmission efficiency which may be realised by fitting dielectric sheaths to the conductor near the horn apertures it is concluded that a theoretical investigation of the scattering properties of the discontinuities  s in order. Thus, the remainder of the Thesis is devoted, to this scattering effect as it may be encountered in the proposed scheme, the theoretical analysis following the lines of earlier documented research. A short-cut method is applied for the determination of certain &#8216;half-plane&#8217; functions which appear in the expressions for the scattered power. Theoretical results are presented together with a discussion of some experimental measurements and a brief theoretical examination of the effects on the horn loss of varying the thickness of the dielectric sheaths. It is argued that the horn loss may be reduced if the dielectric thickness is graded in steps to a value at the horn apertures consistent with the desired &#8216;power capture&#8217;. The Thesis is concluded with an Addendum which outlines a number of topics suggested by the Author for future research.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2542</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of streaming on thermoacoustic systems</field><field name="creator">Starr, Rhys Adam</field><field name="description">Although the current thermoacoustic theory has so far proved successful in allowing us to analyse and understand thermoacoustic systems, there are inherent limitations associated with it. These are related to the fact that this theory is based on linear approximations. As designers search for ways to increase the efficiency and power density of thermoacoustic devices the accuracy of the linear theory decreases significantly, as a variety of non-linear effects start to become important. For example, when the pressure amplitude is increased, in order to increase the power density. This thesis concentrates on the non-linear effect of acoustic streaming. Acoustic streaming is a steady flow that is superimposed upon the acoustic Oscillations. An expression for the streaming velocity is developed for a parallel plate channel having an arbitrary gap width, so that the solution is valid for both thin and wide boundary layers. The solution includes thermal effects arising from the presence of an axial temperature gradient along the channel, and arbitrary phase between the pressure and velocity. An essential feature of the streaming velocity is the generation of circulating loops, which can cause heat to be convected within the channel. An expression for the transverse steady state temperature was also derived, for similar conditions as outlined for the streaming velocity. It was found that when an axial temperature gradient is present the magnitude of the transverse steady state temperature increases significantly as the width of the channel increases. The implication of this is that a significant amount of heat can be convected along the channel due to the action of the streaming velocity. When no axial temperature gradient is present, the transverse steady state temperature reduces to a small constant value outside the boundary layer. A numerical finite difference scheme was developed to model non-linear flow within the two-dimensional channel. The model solves for the conjugate fluid-solid problem enabling the temperature difference induced along the channel to be predicted. The model compared very well to experimental data. It was also found to be in excellent agreement with the analytical solutions for the streaming velocity and the transverse steady state temperature. The effect of streaming on the energy flux density was examined for a wide channel, having a temperature gradient along its length. A fourth-order expression was developed, which yielded a solution in terms of the transverse steady state temperature and second-order mass flux, which for certain conditions could be of a similar magnitude as the second-order terms. For a thermoacoustic core, it was proposed that a toroidal flow could form and convect heat from one heat exchanger to the other. To analysis this effect toroidal flow was incorporated into an expression for the temperature difference induced across a thermoacoustic couple. This result was found to be in excellent agreement with experimental data. The effect of toroidal streaming on the thermoacoustic core was also considered. In addition, a second-order expression for the work flux was derived that included a previously ignored term due to acoustic streaming.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290500 Mechanical and Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The propagation of seismic waves through nonlinear soil media</field><field name="creator">Larkin, T. J. (Thomas J.)</field><field name="description">This study is concerned with a theoretical, laboratory and in situ investigation of the propagation of seismic stress waves through soil media. Analyses are carried out to predict the surface response that results from earthquake motions being transmitted through the upper layers of the earth. The nature of the near surface geological layers affect to a marked degree the intensity of surface motion. The mathematical models presented are used in the evaluation of site response to earthquakes. The theoretical methods used depart from the traditional viscoelastic approach and use a nonlinear hysteretic soil model to describe the complex dynamic stress-strain relationships evident in soil response. The dynamic soil model is based on previous laboratory work carried out at this university. The theoretical solutions formulated are limited to one-dimensional situations. Three methods of analysis are presented for the propagation of seismic shear waves through nonlinear soil media and conclusions are drawn as to the best approach. The results of these analyses are generally significantly different from those obtained using a viscoelastic soil model. Seismic dilatational waves are also considered important and a method is presented to calculate the response of hysteretic soil media to these disturbances. The outcome from these dilatational and shear wave analyses is more accurate surface response spectra for use in aseismic structural design.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2545</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effect of Dosage Rate on The Chemical and Sensory Changes Occurring During Micro-oxygenation of New Zealand Red Wine</field><field name="creator">Dykes, Stuart</field><field name="description">The technique of micro-oxygenation involves the deliberate addition of continuous, metered amounts of oxygen into a vessel of bulk wine during the maturation period (between the end of fermentation and bottling).  The aim of the process is to improve the sensory properties of red wine, particularly the mouthfeel characteristics associated with the various polyphenol constituents.  The success of the process appears to depend strongly on the ability to control the rate of oxygen dosage.  The effect of dosage rate on the chemical and corresponding sensory changes of a red wine is the central theme of this thesis.  A method of dosing oxygen (at typical micro-oxygenation rates) into small volumes of wine (&lt;100 litres) was developed using a dense polymer membrane diffuser.  It was clearly demonstrated that wine could be reliably oxygenated at very low rates using a coiled length of FEP as the diffuser material.  Oxygen dosage was regulated by adjusting the oxygen pressure inside the tube.  The advantage with a dense polymer diffuser is that no bubbles are generated and the oxygenation efficiency is 100%.  The diffuser was fully modeled and characterised for use in the laboratory scale trials detailed in Chapters Four and Six.   The small scale oxygenation equipment was used to conduct a fully replicated experiment to investigate the evolution of a Cabernet Sauvignon wine under four oxygenation treatments at dosage rates of 0, 10, 23 and 36 mg/L/mth.  The total period of the trial was 105 days.  HPLC analysis indicated that the rate change of low molecular weight polyphenols is directly related to the oxygen dosage rate.  The concentration of the majority of the identifiable monomers, most notably the anthocyanins decreased throughout the course of the trial.  The rate of decrease was directly related to oxygen dosage rate.  Thiolysis results showed an increase in mDP for all treatments over the course of the trial until day 77 when they were observed to decrease for all treatments.  The decrease in mDP coincided with an addition of SO2 which was investigated in a subsequent trial.  Spectrophotometric results indicated that the rate of formation of non-bleachable pigments was directly related to the rate of oxygen dosage with significant differences between the high rates (23 and 36 mg/L/mth) and the low rates (0 and 10 mg/L/mth).  The trend for all treatments was for increased levels of stable pigments.  The sensory results show that the measured organoleptic temporal development exhibits a similar oscillatory behaviour compared to the anecdotally derived curve presented in figure 1-2.  The distinction between the respective phases described in section 1.1.1 was, however less clear.  The most significant factor in the model weighting was mouthfeel and astringency which correlates with the observed changes occurring in the wine polypenols during maturation.  Overall the laboratory scale trial showed that the chemical polyphenol development was directly related to the oxygen dosage rate.  The sensory evolution also appeared to be accelerated with higher oxygen dosage rates, although the oscillatory nature of the sensory response given a single linear input indicates a complex underlying mechanism driving the changes.  The effect of SO2 on the development of wine polyphenols with and without oxygen was also investigated.   The presence of SO2 was found to have a significant effect on both mDP and the concentration of non-bleachable pigments.  mDP was observed to decrease over the six week trial period irrespective of whether oxygen had been added or not.  The mDP for the treatments without SO2 increased steadily over the course of the trial.  Similarly the formation of non-bleachable pigments was suppressed and even retarded with SO2 present whereas for the treatments without SO2 a steady increase was observed.  The implication of these results is that SO2 may have a much larger effect on tannin development than oxygen. The use of electrochemical micro-oxidation (or ELMOX) was examined ostensibly to determine proof of concept and also compare the performance of glassy carbon and titanium as electrode materials against traditional micro-oxygenation.   Notable transformations occurred with titanium showing higher levels of ethanal than the other treatments both chemically and by sensory measure.  A greater rate of stable pigment formation was also observed for the titanium compared to the other treatments.  The respective dosage rates for the glassy carbon ELMOX and traditional micro-oxygenation treatments were too low to be able to discriminate any significant differences compared to the control wine.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Micro-oxygenation</field><field name="subject">Red Wine</field><field name="subject">polyphenols</field><field name="subject">wine oxidation</field><field name="subject">computational fluid dynamics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2578</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Elastic analysis of soil media.</field><field name="creator">Ramsay, Graham</field><field name="description">Elastic Solutions can be used to predict stresses and displacements in loaded soil media provided the non-linear stress-strain behaviour of the soil is recognised and allowance made for it in calculating displacements. This thesis examines the methods of elastic analysis suitable for examining problems in Soil Mechanics and the determination of suitable stress-strain parameters. The use of the Finite Element method in Soil Mechanics is reviewed, and a computer program for examining linear elastic plane stress and plane strain problems is presented. The program has been used to examine a range of problems involving infinitely long excavations of rectangular cross-section in the surface of a stratum overlying a rigid base. The excavations were analysed for a uniform vertical loading in the base of the excavation and for lateral wall loads representing the effect of the release of the insitu stresses during excavation. Cases in which the lateral movement of the walls is completely restrained are also considered, and the effect of wall restraint on the vertical displacements due to the vertical base loading is shown to be small. Results obtained by the author suggest that care should be exercised in the use of the Finite Element method to analyse problems involving loaded rigid footings or the stresses behind rigid retaining walls, and that the solutions in these cases may be inaccurate. The solutions available for surface loadings on layered elastic strata are reviewed and results obtained from a Fourier Series approach are presented for a range of problems involving surface loadings on a single rigid base elastic stratum. Uniform vertical and horizontal strip loadings and rigid strip footings with vertical, horizontal and moment loadings are considered. A uniform vertical strip load on the surface of a multilayer stratum overlying a half space or rigid base is also analysed. The computer programs and full mathematical derivations for the strip loading cases are presented, and the extension of the solutions to rectangular loadings is discussed and the basic mathematical derivations outlined. The application of the Fourier Series solutions to the calculation of consolidation settlements is discussed. Work by other investigators suggests that a hyperbolic model may be suitable for approximating soil stress-strain curves and that fundamental stress-strain behaviour should be examined in tests in which the bulk stress remains constant during the application of the shear stress. Equipment designed to carry out slow drained triaxial tests in which the bulk stress is constant during the shearing phase is described, and the results of a short series of tests used to proof test the equipment are presented.</field><field name="date">1973</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2536</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical modelling of wave runup on breakwaters</field><field name="creator">Palmer, Gavin Noel</field><field name="description">The design of rubble mound breakwaters is typically based on empirical formulae and physical modelling. One limitation of this approach is that different aspects of wave interaction with a breakwater, such as the elevation of the runup tip and armour stability, are treated separately. Therefore the development of a numerical model of wave runup on a rubble mound breakwater was the primary objective of the research described in this thesis. Because of the range of slope conditions encountered with rubble mound breakwaters and revetments, two types of armour layer are considered. The first is impermeable and so only the flow within the external region is modelled. The flow is assumed to be governed by the unsteady one-dimensional shallow water wave equations and only regular waves are considered. It is shown how the use of the finite element method with a mesh of isoparametric elements that deforms and is fitted to the runup tip has a number of advantages over the traditional use of the finite difference method with a fixed grid. Reasonably good results were obtained for the numerical modelling of wave runup on a riprap armoured l:3 impermeable slope indicating that the numerical model may, in conjunction with a physical model, be of practical use in the design of revetments. Wave runup on smooth and Dolos armoured 1:1.5 impermeable slopes was modelled poorly. Therefore the model is more appropriate for wave runup on a revetment than a rubble mound breakwater. The second type of armour layer is permeable and so the flow within the external region and armour layer is modelled simultaneously by coupling numerical models for the respective regions. It is concluded that this approach is unlikely to give acceptable results for the runup of regular waves on a steep, permeable armour layer unless it also accounts for the non-hydrostatic distribution of pressure within the external region. An experiment is described in which continuous time histories of wave runup and dynamic pressure due to regular waves on smooth and Dolos armoured 1:1.5 slopes were measured. The results are used to discuss the assumption of hydrostatic pressure. A method of assessing armour stability requirements which takes into consideration the effects of armour unit interaction is proposed. It is recommended that this is examined further.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2514</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Site response to earthquakes with reference to the application of microtremor measurements.</field><field name="creator">Parton, Ian M.</field><field name="description">It is generally accepted that some areas of the earth's surface are more prone to earthquake occurrence than others. Furthermore, within these earthquake-prone area the distribution of earthquake epicentres is non-uniform. Ttis has led to a system of regional zoning for earthquake resistant design in most countries. Observations of localised damage resulting from earthquakes has only recently led to the general acceptance of the fact that the degree of damage may be influenced by the characteristics of the soils in the affected area. Where the damage is related to gross instability of the soil resulting in large permanent deformations, association of the damage with local soil conditions is readily apparent. A somewhat less obvious effect of soil conditions on building damage is that subsurface soil layering can influence the intensity of ground shaking, and the frequency content of the surface motion, even though the soils underlying structures may remain perfectly stable during an earthquake. The frequency characteristics of the surface motion are important as the existence of a predominant ground frequency may lead to resonance of structures during prolonged shaking. In Chapter 2 a brief resume of existing knowledge of the occurrence, origin and nature of earthquakes is presented. Basic wave models and wave types are outlined.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2535</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A dual channel solar radiometer</field><field name="creator">Wakeman, Philip E.

The system used is a two receiver multiplying interferometer with the addition of phase switching. A computer controlled phase cancelling system is used to make the interferometer fringe track the source (i.e the sun), thereby producing a rectified output. An outline of the design of comb-line filters is given. These low loss transmission filters are used at the receiver inputs to attenuate strong out of band interfering signals. Operational amplifiers are used to gain stabilize the RF preamplifiers. Very low sensitivity of gain to temperature change is shown to result from the use of this technique.

Basecourse saturation results in increased flexural strains in the asphaltic layer and increased rutting leading to cracking of the surface layer. To obtain a physical and quantitative understanding of the deformation characteristics of saturated granular basecourse materials and the associated failure mechanisms of the pavement structure, laboratory testing equipment was developed including an automated kneading compactor, dynamic triaxial apparatus and a constant head permeameter. Tests were carried out on 250 mm diameter compacted samples of a basaltic aggregate having a maximum particle size of 38 mm. Dynamic tests were performed on both unsaturated and saturated samples. Characterisation tests established variations in resilient moduli and Poisson&#8217;s ratio with deviator and confining stress for use in multi-layer elastic analyses. The results of a testing program where samples were subjected to stress states simulating traffic loading, indicated that saturation approximately doubles resilient deformations and increases creep rates by as much as a factor of 10. These changes are caused by loss of capillary stress on saturation and increases in dynamic pore water pressures as a result of applied lateral pressures. A fundamental relationship between the creep rate and the resilient strain amplitude was established, and provides a simple key for the comparative study of different aggregates and the assessment of rut depths in design applications. To assess the effects of dissipation on the magnitude of the dynamic pore water pressures in a pavement structure, a permeability study was carried out on compacted basecourse samples. The permeability characteristics measured were used in a computer analysis to establish the effects of dissipation. Graphs were established showing the effects of permeability and traffic speed on the pore water pressure response. The permeability tests also showed that fines were transported at hydraulic gradients in excess of l resulting in clogging of pore channels and large reductions in permeability. Comparative analyses were carried out to assess the response of saturated and unsaturated pavement sections using the deformation characteristics established in conjunction with a multi-layered elastic computer program. Results of the analyses indicated that the increase in rut depth due to basecourse creep deformation may be 100 times larger for a saturated pavement compared to an unsaturated pavement.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2540</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A finite element for the elastic stability analysis of frameworks.</field><field name="creator">Davidson, B.

The theoretical model treats an off-axis unidirectional ply as an inhomogeneous material, and considers the effect of rigid body rotations of the fibres within the matrix material. Linear analytical, and nonlinear finite element solutions are developed for the model. The differences between the new model and the traditional homogenous orthotropic characterisation are functions of both the strain level, and the relative modulus ratio (Ef/Em) of the constituent materials. For relative constituent moduli typical of most common FRP materials, there are significant differences between the new Rigid Body Motion (RBM) model and homogenous orthotropic characterisations at strains greater than 1%. In a 30&#176; case with Ef/Em = 100 and a strain level of 2%, the RBM theory predicts a longitudinal modulus 11% higher than the linear orthotropic theory. At small strain levels the RBM theory reduces to the homogenous orthotropic approximation. A simple and reliable methodology is developed and verified for the experimental characterisation of off-axis tensile FRP specimens. The method applies a tensile load to a thin walled tubular specimen through a high strength, small diameter length of steel wire. The low torsional stiffness of the wire allows one end of the tube to rotate, thus preventing any torsional constraint. Analytical and experimental verifications both indicate that the required tensile load can be applied to tubular specimens without significant torsional constraint. The wire based testing method is used to measure the off-axis stiffness properties of carbon/epoxy tubular specimens at a range of fibre orientations.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290500 Mechanical and Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2513</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simple shear compaction of basecourse aggregates</field><field name="creator">Peploe, Ross John</field><field name="description">The objective of this research project has been to develop a computer controlled cyclic simple shear apparatus and to investigate the repeated load behaviour of local basecourse aggregates with regard to their shear modulus and volume change properties. A detailed discussion of the construction of the apparatus and the development of the control systems is presented. A review of the litreature regarding cyclic load testing of basecourse aggregates has been undertaken and presented in this thesis. A large number of shear displacement controlled cyclic simple shear tests were carried out using three types of local Auckland aggregate. A comparison of the performance of these materials is presented with particular emphasis placed on the shear modulus, volume change and particle degredation properties. High repitition cyclic simple shear tests have revealed an apparent stiffness recovery for granular specimens between test runs. This behaviour is difficult to explain, however it is thought to be related to the transition from a dynamic to a static state of friction within the specimen. The volume change properties of granular specimens have been found to be equivalent to the 'normally consolidated - over consolidated' behaviour of fine grained soils. This observation is consistent with that reported by Youd (1970) who performed similar tests using specimens of sand. The implications of this result are discussed with respect to the potential application to highway engineering. A number of shear stress controlled cyclic simple shear tests have been performed to investigate the applicability of a stability threshold for basecourse materials. The stability threshold, or shakedown behaviour, has been observed and is incorporated in a philosophy for pavement design. An example of this method has been performed to show the potential merits of including stability threshold data in the pavement design procedure.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2510</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The plug flow of paper pulp suspensions</field><field name="creator">Moller, Klaus</field><field name="description">The investigation reported in this thesis is part of a programme of research concerning the flow behaviour of paper pulp suspensions commenced at the University of Auckland in 1969. A primary aim of the research was to supply the industry with reliable pipe friction data for the pulps manufactured in New Zealand mills. Secondly, it was hoped to increase the fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of flow of the suspensions in pipes and so devise a more satisfactory method of correlation than the one used at present. Pipe friction data were obtained for two N.Z. groundwood pulps, two N.Z. Kraft pulps and one imported Kraft pulp in 1, 2, 3 and 4 inch pipes for a wide range of consistencies and velocities. The data were of the same form as previously reported in the literature, but for a given set of conditions the friction losses were lower for the N.Z. pulps. For Kraft pulps the curves of head loss versus velocity exhibited the usual maxima and minima, but for groundwoods the decrease in head loss from the maximum to the minimum and the subsequent rise were replaced by an approximately level portion. The data in the regime before the maxima in the head loss curves for Kraft pulps were correlated to allow extrapolation to the larger pipes used in the paper mill. This regime incorporates the majority of practical flow situations for consistencies over two per cent. The limits of the regime were approximately defined by values of the dimensionless friction factor. The correlation method used was a slight modification of that employed by previous authors. The data for groundwood pulps were correlated in a similar way. The head losses predicted by the new correlations were consistently lower than those calculated from previous equations. Observation of the flow in perspex pipes confirmed the mechanisms of flow proposed by some previous authors, but disagreed with the mechanisms proposed by others. The mechanisms of flow of groundwood pulps were found to be essentially similar to those of Kraft pulps except that the groundwoods exhibited a plug cleavage phenomenon at very low velocities. The different shapes of friction curve for the two types of pulp were attributed directly to their macroscopic properties. A flow model was developed on the basis of the observed flow behaviour in pipes in which the suspensions move as a fibre/water plug surrounded by a sheared water annulus. The model assumed that the annulus formed as a result of the action of the hydrodynamic shear stress on the fibre network comprising the plug. The analysis resulted in an expression relating the average velocity and the longitudinal pressure gradient in the pipe and also incorporated the pipe radius, the viscosity of the suspending medium &#956; and a pseudo shear modulus for the fibre network G. The plug flow model was found to apply to the data in the regime before the maximum in the head loss curve. The relation between the pressure gradient and the pipe diameter as predicted by the model was slightly erroneous for some pulps, although it was the same as that in the standard empirical correlation used in design by the industry. This led to the conclusion that the deflection of fibre ends on the plug surface also contributed to the formation of the annulus, as proposed by previous authors. The relative importance of the two mechanisms of annulus formation was used to explain the occurrence of the maxima and minima in the head loss curves for chemical pulps. The plug flow model was found to be closely related to both the direct correlation method used in the past and to the standard pseudoplastic model for non-Newtonian pipe flow. The model was also applied to analogous flow in a rotational viscometer. The values of the pseudo shear modulus G calculated from the rotational viscometry data were the same as those calculated from pipe flow data under certain conditions. However, limitations in the equipment and the effect of gravitational settling restricted the results to a narrow range. The behaviour of the pulp suspensions in batch settling tests varied markedly from pulp to pulp. There was a high correlation between the pseudo shear modulus G obtained from pipe flow data and the final height of the suspension in a settling test. Likewise there was a relationship between the effective viscosity of the suspending medium &#956; (as modified by the proportion of fines in the pulp) and the initial settling rate in a batch test. This suggested that a simple and accurate method of determining pipe friction data from batch settling test data is possible. Settling tests also showed that air content and the presence of acidic and basic ions, but not the viscosity of the suspending medium, increased the strength of fibre networks. A further correlation method to incorporate all flow regimes was suggested from the results of the present investigation and from indications in the literature that fibre networks behave like Bingham plastics when they are sheared.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2534</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of soil-pile interaction under static loads</field><field name="creator">Goldsmith, Peter R.</field><field name="description">This model study is concerned with attempting to identify some of the mechanics of pile-soil interaction under the influence of static loads, as a pre-requisite to defining the mechanics of the soil response to pile transmitted dynamic (i.e. seismic) lateral soil loads. The emphasis has been directed at the mechanics of the response of the soil to loads transmitted through the pile, rather than the more usual approach of defining an analytical pile model and assuming a soil response. The work contained herein follows the incremental deformations occurring within a soil mass throughout the process of installation through to the ultimate lateral loading condition. To enable this to be done the comparatively recent developments in soil mechanics involving the application of the techniques of stereophotogrammetry and radiography, have been employed. The study is mainly involved with short rigid models in dry dense sand. A more general aim of the research project has been to attempt to draw the more research orientated and practical aspects of the statically loaded pile problem closer together. To this end, state-of &#8211;the-art reviews of both the axial and lateral loading situations have been conducted and an attempt made to relate them to the mechanics of soil response, as identified both in this research project and from full scale tests reported in the literature. An attempt has been made to apply some of the more general observations resulting from the study, to the Type A prediction, (i.e. before the event), of the ground line displacements of a full scale pile under real site conditions when subjected to various loads.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2549</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The flow behaviour of particulate solids and capsules in wood pulp fibre suspensions</field><field name="creator">Walmsley, Michael Richard Walter</field><field name="description">This thesis describes an investigation into the flow behaviour of particulate solids and capsules in wood pulp fibre suspensions. Emphasis is placed on measuring pipe friction loss and stability of solids-fibre slurries and fibre-capsule mixtures in straight horizontal pipes. It is shown that low concentrations (1-3 %v) of wood pulp fibre form a structured carrier fluid with ability to support particles while behaving like a liquid of low viscosity. At moderate flow velocities fibres damp turbulence and friction losses become lower than water. If solids are preferentially injected into the fibre suspension as a central core, or in a capsule as dry solids, pipe friction loss is reduced further, as is pipe wear. At very low fibre concentrations (&lt;1%v), fibres reduce the friction loss of conventional solid-water mixtures and act as a drag reducing additive. The network strength properties of five wood fibre suspensions are reported and their application to slurry flow is discussed. Settling data for particulate solids, coherent dense-phase cores and capsules are presented and various mechanisms of support are described. Two flow techniques for transporting coarse and dense-phase particle suspensions are proposed, along with strategies for injecting solid particulates into a pipeline. Pipe friction loss data are presented for solids-fibre mixtures of wood chips (7-15 mm), coarse (+2-10 mm) and fine (+0.5-1.0 mm) coal, sand (+0.32-2.0 mm), iron ore (+0.05-0.28 mm), and cylindrical capsules (loaded with dry solids) flowing in 54, 79 and 101.6 mm diameter PVC pipes. Some pipe friction loss data are presented for solids transported as a central core supported by an annulus of fibre suspension. The key flow parameters are also optimized and a preliminary cost comparison is made. Coarse coal suspensions (up to 4O %v) with fibre concentrations of 0.7 to 1.0 percent have been shown to exhibit friction losses about 40 percent below that of the equivalent coalwater slurry. Adding 0.8 percent fibre to water is shown to reduce capsule friction head loss up to 50 percent.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290600 Chemical Engineering</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291400 Materials Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2518</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Outage probability in mobile radio systems</field><field name="creator">Sowerby, K. W. (Kevin W.)</field><field name="description">Outage probability calculations are presented for the analogue land mobile radio situation where in order to obtain satisfactory radio reception both a sufficient CNR and CIR need to be achieved simultaneously. Such calculations can be used in the design and analysis of mobile radio systems and may be particularly useful for investigating the effects of cochannel interference in cellular systems. The outage probability expressions are derived using previously reported statistical descriptions of mobile radio propagation. Attention is generally focussed on situations where signals suffer Rayleigh fading and/or lognormal shadowing. However calculations for Nakagami-m, Rice and Weibull fading are also considered. The rapid growth in cellular mobile radio systems has stimulated the development of outage probability calculations for multiple interferer situations. Previously, while single interferer situations had been treated exactly, multiple interferers had been treated by approximate methods. In this thesis exact multiple interferer outage probability expressions are presented for the Rayleigh fading and the joint 'fading and shadowing' (Suzuki) situations. Similar expressions, but for more limited cases, are also presented for lognormal and Nakagami-m statistics. Using results from these expressions the accuracies of several approximate outage probability methods are assessed. The exact outage probability expressions for multiple Suzuki interferer situations are closely related to those for multiple Rayleigh interferer situations. Indeed, the exact analytic expressions for Rayleigh statistics form an integral part of the corresponding outage probability expressions for Suzuki statistics. These latter expressions can be readily evaluated using Gauss-Hermite numerical integration. In order to demonstrate the use of such calculations for mobile radio system analysis several theoretical examples are presented. Outage probability calculations for multiple interferer systems which employ diversity reception as a means of improving communications reliability are considered. Similarly, the extension of outage probability concepts to digital systems is briefly outlined.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bus crew scheduling and the set partitioning model</field><field name="creator">Falkner, Julie Carolyn</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the development of a bus crew scheduling method, based on a set partitioning model, for the Christchurch Transport Board, New Zealand. It also examines in detail the effects of the high degree of degeneracy in scheduling set partitioning models. Degeneracy can cause severe computational difficulties because it inflates the number of simplex iterations needed to solve the set partitioning linear programme. In this thesis, it is shown that a maximum-pivot leaving variable criterion can considerably improve the performance of the simplex method, but that this alone is insufficient. Experiments with several degeneracy-resolving techniques have been performed on a class of highly degenerate problems arising from an air crew rostering application, and the results are discussed. Before the set partitioning model can be applied to scheduling, the problem size must be heuristically reduced. Therefore the overall Christchurch system is divided into several subsystems which are solved sequentially. Also, a three-stage method has been developed which essentially considers each type of duty individually. At the first stage, meal-breaks are allocated carefully to reduce the effects of the loss of interaction among the subproblems. A further heuristic reduction technique is then applied to each subproblem, not only to reduce its size but also to improve its integer properties. The resulting solution method has been applied to the Christchurch weekday scheduling problem. A special technique for the Sunday scheduling problem has also been developed. The two methods are described and the promising results which have been achieved are discussed.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2517</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Local scour at bridge piers</field><field name="creator">Chiew, Yee Meng</field><field name="description">Local scour at cylindrical bridge piers in both uniform and non-uniform cohesionless sediments was investigated experimentally. The aim of the study was to improve understanding of local scour around bridge piers with sediment transport. Three empirical functions which relate the equilibrium depth of scour with approach velocity, flow depth and sediment size were obtained for uniform sediments. The effects of armouring and sediment sizes were also investigated for non-uniform sediments. The experimental results for the variation of equilibrium scour depth (normalised with the pier diameter) with approach velocity show that the equilibrium scour depth reaches a maximum at the threshold condition of the bed sediment. Above the threshold velocity, the scour depth first decreases and then increases again with increasing velocity to a maximum at the transition flat bed condition. At still higher velocities, the equilibrium scour depth decreases due to the formation of antidunes. Lesser scour depths are recorded with ripple forming sediment at threshold conditions because the bed associated with a ripple forming sediment is unable to remain planar. In live-bed conditions, the effect of rippling diminishes for increasing velocity and becomes negligible for UO/UOC &gt; 2. The experimental results for the variation of equilibrium scour depth with flow depth show that the trend for live-bed scour of increasing scour depth with increasing YO/D until a maximum influence of YO/D is reached, is similar to that for clear water scour as shown by Ettema (1980). A flow depth adjustment factor, K(YO/D), which is related to YO/D with D/d50 as the third parameter is presented which indicates to a designer the sequence of estimation of the effect of flow depth on the equilibrium depth of scour. The effect of sediment size on the eguilibrium scour depth is presented in terms of the relative size of pier to sediment, D/d50. A family of curves, at various values of UO/UOC, which relate dav/D and D/d50 for live-bed scour was obtained. The curves show that the equilibrium scour depth increases almost linearly for increasing values of D/d50 until it reaches the value of D/d50 = 50 after which the scour depth becomes independent of D/d50. A similar trend was obtained by Ettema (1980) for clear water scour. For design purposes, the data for large values of YO/D are presented in terms of a sediment adjustment factor, K(D/d), which is shown to be independent of the flow velocity. Both flow depth and sediment size functions include results by Shen et al (1966), Ettema (1980), Chee (1982), and the present study. Armouring and sediment size play an important role in reducinq the equilibrium scour depth for non-uniform sediments. The latter is particularly significant in laboratory experiments where the size of the pier is generally small relative to the size of the coarse particles in non-uniform sediments. Experiments were conducted under dynamic equilibrium conditions where there is continuous sediment input from upstream of the scour hole such that at equilibrium, the amount of sediment entering the bridge site is equal to that leaving. Both the effects of armouring and sediment size diminish for increasing velocity. At high velocity where all the sediment particles are mobile, the non-uniform sediment behaves like a uniform sediment. Hence, armouring does not occur and the equivalent size used for sediment adjustment is based on the d50 size of the sediment bed. At low velocity, armouring at the base of the scour hole is prominent and adjustment of D/d is based on the d90 size of the original mixture. An alternative condition can exist in natural rivers in contrast to the dynamic equilibrium conditions simulated in this study. This is where the upstream river is armoured such that there is little or no sediment input to the scour hole. It is postulated that, in this case, the equilibrium scour depth can approach the maximum equilibrium scour depth for clear water conditions (i.e. dav/D + 2.3) when the approach velocity is equal to the critical velocity of the non-uniform sediment. Finally, a design flow chart is presented for estimation of the equilibrium depth of local scour for design purposes. In live-bed scour where bed features are present, the results show that half the height of the bed features can be added to the estimated equilibrium scour depth.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2520</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The one dimensional behaviour of sand</field><field name="creator">Alexander, Robert Charles Koch</field><field name="description">This study examines the one dimensional response of sand.

The apparatus is also used to examine one dimensional unloading following horizontal shearing of a vertically loaded sample, which is of special interest for one dimensional behaviour in liquefaction associated phenomena. The one dimensional experimental results obtained from this apparatus are modelled using a mechanistic theory proposed by Dr G. R. Martin.

In heterogeneous media the material parameters may vary with position, dependent variable value and/or time. The governing equation of a physical problem in heterogeneous media is therefore likely to involve variable coefficients. For this reason the solution of variable coefficient partial differential equations (PDEs) is an important engineering problem. In this thesis ways of solving linear variable coefficient PDEs using the boundary element method have been investigated. The application of the boundary element method to these equations is hampered by the difficulty of finding a fundamental solution. In the literature several methods have been proposed to overcome this problem. A survey of these methods has been undertaken in this study from which it is concluded that the most promising approach is the dual reciprocity boundary element method (DR-BEM). The DR-BEM is tested in this thesis for a range of elliptic variable coefficient PDEs. The results of these test problems indicate that the DR-BEM is a promising method for solving elliptic variable coefficient PDEs. However, in some cases, such as problems in highly heterogeneous media, it is found that a large number of internal solution nodes are necessary to ensure accurate results. This can make the DR-BEM computationally expensive. Some new approaches for improving the efficiency of the DR-BEM are proposed. For problems in highly heterogeneous media a subregion approach is recommended. The use of the DR-BEM for linear parabolic variable coefficient PDEs is also investigated. It is found that by combining the DR-BEM with the coupled finite difference &#8211; boundary element method a wide range of parabolic problems can be solved without requiring domain integration. This time-stepping approach can become expensive for variable coefficient PDEs (particularly for large-time solutions) as it requires the solution of a large number of associated elliptic problems with large numbers of internal nodes. Also, it is found that for some problems in highly heterogeneous media the error at each time-step can accumulate leading to poor large-time solutions. To avoid these limitations semi-analytic approaches for solving parabolic equations are investigated. A new semi-analytic method - the separation of variables dual reciprocity method (SOV-DRM) - is proposed which constructs the solution as an eigenfunction expansion. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors are determined using the DR-BEM. This method allows parabolic problems to be solved without requiring time-stepping or domain integration. This method is found to produce accurate results for a range of problems including some problems involving heterogeneous media. Two other semi-analytic methods are also investigated. These methods are implemented and compared with the SOV-DRM. It is concluded that each method has specific strengths and weaknesses and that the choice of method is largely problem dependent.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2551</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Two-phase gas-liquid flow with particular emphasis on holdup measurements and predictions</field><field name="creator">Chen, J. J. J. (John Jiunn Jye)</field><field name="description">The work described in this thesis is an analytical and experimental study of two-phase gas-liquid horizontal flow in a conduit with particular emphasis on holdup measurements and predictions. Holdup and pressure drop, their inter-relationships, and their flow pattern dependence were investigated. A simple method for flow pattern determination was presented so that the appropriate prediction method may be selected for a particular situation. The results were discussed by comparison with a wide range of experimental data and the relevant literature. Two simple devices for holdup measurements were developed in this work and their behaviours were also found to be flow pattern dependent. The results are as follows: In the analytical study, the original Lockhart-Martinelli formulation was treated analytically for ideal stratified flow giving equations which agree with experimental pressure drop and holdup data and the more rigorously derived relationships of Johannessen and Taitel &amp; Dukler. For ideal annular flow, the derived equations predicted pressure drop in large diameter pipes reasonably well giving results which are in agreement with the modified equation of Baker. Poor prediction was achieved for small diameter pipes. The holdup equations derived for annular flow were also in poor agreement with experimental data although a slight modification resulted in an equation that was not only suitable for holdup prediction, but also may be used to represent the original Lockhart-Martinelli holdup correlation over the entire operating range. A correlation was presented for the frictional pressure drop in annular flow based on laboratory air-water data and geothermal steam-water data. The correlation was found to predict pressure loss values which agreed with data from various different sources. The correlation exhibited a point of inflexion which was believed to be due to the transition from a ripple wave type of interfacial disturbance to one of roll wave-droplet entrainment. An extensive literature survey showed that such a transition at high gas rate occurs at all flow orientations and is governed by a critical liquid rate given by a definite value of the Weber number defined in terms of the liquid phase. The Butterworth form of holdup equation was justified by assuming ideal stratified and annular turbulent-turbulent and viscous-viscous flows. A full set of equations for stratified flow covering the cases of liquid-gas, turbulent-viscous and viscous-turbulent were also derived. It was found that the variation in the coefficients and exponential factors in the Butterworth equation was due to at least three factors: the flow pattern, the flow regimes of the phases, i.e., viscous or turbulent, and the range of the value of the ratio of the liquid holdup to the voidage. Furthermore, experimental data were found to behave according to whether the flow pattern was stratified, slug and plug or annular. Equations for determining these flow patterns were presented, based on the derived stratified flow equations, and were checked to be in agreement with the flow pattern maps of Mandhane et al and Taitel &amp; Dukler, and the experimental flow pattern observations of this work. Since the derivation from the original Lockhart-Martinelli formulation did not yield a completely satisfactory relationship for the holdup and pressure drop in annular flow, such a relationship was examined in terms of the film flow equations, Newton's law of viscosity and the Prandtl&#8217;s mixing length. This was also compared with the analysis of Levy of annular-mist flow using the mixing length theory. Throughout the analysis, the results were compared with various sources of laboratory air-water data and geothermal steam-water data, and the discrepancies, if any, were discussed. The rise velocity of Taylor bubbles in conduits was also examined in terms of the film flow equations, the Newton's law of viscosity, the Prandtl&#8217;s mixing length theory and the universal velocity distribution equations. The rise velocity of a Taylor bubble as derived by the Prandtl's mixing length theory has the same form as that derived by Dumitriscu and Davies &amp; Taylor who used the classical potential flow theory. The analysis was extended to justify the Armand equation for holdup for slug and plug flows. Thus, to summarise the analytical work presented in this work, given a set of input conditions, the flow pattern may be predicted as one of three: stratified, slug and plug, annular. From a knowledge of the flow pattern, appropriate methods of holdup and pressure drop prediction may be chosen. The interrelationships between holdup and pressure drop for stratified and annular flow have also been shown. In the experimental study, the application of two simple devices, developed in this work, one of which was subsequently patented, for holdup measurement was investigated. Both devices were found to be flow pattern dependent in their behaviour and require calibrations. During the study of these two devices, pressure drop, holdup and flow pattern data were also generated and were used for the comparison with the analytical part of this work.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2548</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploitation of geothermal reservoirs</field><field name="creator">Krol, Dexter E.</field><field name="description">This work presents a numerical model for simulating the response of a geothermal reservoir to exploitation.

The thrust of this work is towards the reduction of cost by replacing the more conventional synchronous generator by an induction machine and, by eliminating the site-specific fully-governed turbine. An electronic load governor, utilising zero-voltage switching to minimise waveform distortion, is used to regulate the system frequency by controlling the generator loading. The performance of the load governor is analysed in conjunction with both synchronous and induction generators, and the conditions under which the governed system is stable are determined. The induction machine is shown to have better operating characteristics than the synchronous machine and has the further advantages of low maintenance and ready availability making it particularly suitable for isolated applications. A theoretical explanation of the process by which an induction machine self-excites when capacitance is connected across its terminals is developed, and methods of guaranteeing excitation are proposed. It is shown that the remanent magnetism, present in the rotor, plays a significant role in the machine excitation and the conditions leading to loss of remanence are investigated. Once excited, the operation of the induction generator is analysed for both balanced and unbalanced loadings. The practical implications of these results are taken into account in proposals for single phase supplies, these being more desirable in smaller systems. A range of static VAr sources, including a switched capacitor VAr source and an inductively loaded ac-to-dc converter, are considered for controlling the machine&#8217;s excitation. The VAr sources are compared on the basis of harmonic distortion and system stability. The thesis considers the application of these devices to micro-hydro and wind generating systems. Preliminary investigations have been carried out into the use of two-speed induction machines to improve the efficiency of CSCF Constant Speed Constant Frequency wind generating schemes and into the use of centrifugal pumps as ungoverned turbines. Practical results obtained from laboratory experiments and tests on existing micro-hydro installations are included. It is shown that significant reductions in cost are obtainable by employing the methods discussed in this thesis. The resultant systems may incur a reduction in efficiency but there is little reduction in performance and in many respects the quality of supply is improved.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2521</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A separate texture/edge image coding system.</field><field name="creator">Knowles, David John</field><field name="description">Digitised pictures have both cosmetic and scientific image aspects. This thesis presents an image coding system that compresses monochromatic digital image information in such a way that the cosmetic-or viewed-image aspects of a reconstructed picture are indistinguishable from the original to a (human) observer. The coding system is concerned with viewed aspects of digitised images and is based on a simplified 2-channel model of the human eye, with the image information being separated into slowly varying texture information and rapidly changing edge information corresponding to those two channels. Each of the two types of image data is coded using techniques suited to its individual characteristics. Texture information is coded using predictive waveform coding where the predictive filter coefficients are generated by linear predictive coding (LPC) techniques. Since the waveform prediction is not perfect, this thesis evaluates several different methods of differential pulse code modulation (DPCM) coding the residual prediction error. This signal is then used to improve the texture coding quality. Image edges are isolated from the digital image data by an asymptotically optimal edge detector known as the Laplacian of Gaussian (LOG) filter. Using two image edge models, the LOG isolated edges produce contours which are used to define edge position, shape, and "sharpness". The edge position data is then compressed using a chain-coding system. The thesis also considers the effect the edge characteristics have on the coding system and develops two methods for reducing the number of coded edges. Reconstruction of the coded image is in two parts corresponding to the two channels of the coding system. The texture information is reconstructed by predicting texture pixels and adding the decoded DPCM error signal. Edge information not contained in the texture coding channel is reconstructed using only edge information corresponding to the high spatial frequency channels of the human eye. These two channels are added together producing the final coded image reconstruction. Also considered are the effects of varying the original image sampling density. The 2-channel coding system is applicable to a wide variety of images, producing coded images with a high visual quality and coding bitrates as low as 0.6 bits/pixel (256 x 256 pixel images), while maintaining a relatively low computational overhead both at the encoder and the decoder.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2515</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An empirical study of management controls in product development</field><field name="creator">Akroyd, Christopher Lorin</field><field name="description">Product development is critical for many firms, because in many industries the development of products has become a primary source of competitive advantage. To manage this process many firms use management controls, but the effect of those controls on product development is not clear. Recent research in the product development field suggests that the role of management control is to reduce uncertainty rather than the traditionally-assumed focus of promoting goal congruence, and that organisation members use management controls in an interactive style rather than in the traditionally-assumed diagnostic style. The objective of this thesis is to provide empirical insight into management control practices in product development with particular reference to the interface between organisation members across different functions and hierarchal levels within the organisation. It examines both the role of management controls; either to promote goal congruence or to reduce uncertainty, and the style in which management controls are used; either interactively, diagnostically, to set boundaries, or influence beliefs during the activities that take place during the product development process for different types of product development project. To better understand how this takes place this thesis reports on the boundary objects (i.e. numbers, documents and models) that organisation members use during the product development activities to accomplish management control in practice. Empirical field material was collected during a nine-month intensive longitudinal field study, informed by practice theory (ethnomethodology), which was carried out at a large Australasian multinational company within the consumer foods industry. A participant observation approach was used to collect material from a wide range of sources within the company, including interactions and meetings involving executive managers, functional managers, and product development project teams who were members of the technology, marketing, sales, operations and finance departments. The empirical results indicate that the role of management control changes during the product development process alternating between reducing uncertainty and promoting goal congruence. The style in which management controls are used also differs depending on the stage of the product development process and the nature of the product development projects. Finally, management control was accomplished through the use of different boundary objects for each type of product development project.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Management Control</field><field name="subject">Product Development</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2505</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb Adsorption by Iron Oxyhydroxides in SO4-rich Systems Simulating Acid Mine Drainage</field><field name="creator">Swedlund, Peter James</field><field name="description">Acid mine drainage (AMD) typically involves waters with low pH (pH 2-4) and high concentrations of Fe, SO4 and potentially toxic trace metals. Adsorption onto iron oxyhydroxides is the dominant mechanism controlling the transport and toxicity of trace metals in water bodies impacted by AMD. The purpose of this study was to apply the Diffuse Layer Model (DLM) to describe the adsorption of trace metals by iron oxyhydroxides from these systems, using synthetic iron oxyhydroxide minerals, ferrihydrite, pure acicular goethite, SO4-rich goethite prepared from FeSO4 oxidation and a synthetic schwertmannite.  The ferrihydrite adsorption of the trace metals Cu, Zn, Cd and Co from single sorbate systems was accurately described using the DLM with two surface site types (type-1 and type-2) having site densities of 0.005 and 0.2 mol (mol Fe)-1 respectively. The ferrihydrite adsorption of SO4 from single sorbate systems was accurately described using the DLM with adsorption on the type-2 sites. However, the enhanced adsorption of Cu, Zn, Cd and Co in the presence of SO4 was not predicted using adsorption constants derived from single sorbate systems. By including a neutral ternary complex with stoichiometry &#61626;Fe(2)OHMeSO4 (where &#61626;Fe(2)OH is a type-2 surface site and Me is the trace metal) the effect of SO4 on metal adsorption was accurately described for the range of Me, Fe and SO4 concentrations studied. The adsorption of Cu and Zn onto schwertmannite at total metal to iron ratios (MeT:Fe) up to 8 x 10-3 was almost identical to that predicted for ferrihydrite in the presence of 0.01 mol kg-1 SO4. To model the ferrihydrite adsorption of Pb from single sorbate systems a third higher affinity site (type-0) with a site density of 0.00035 mol (mol Fe)-1 was required. The effect of SO4 on Pb adsorption could only be modelled by including a neutral ternary complex on both the type 1 and type 2 sites in the case of Pb. Metal adsorption onto a pure acicular goethite could be accurately described by the DLM with two surface site types. The type 2 site density that provided the best fit to the goethite adsorption data was 0.027 mol (mol Fe)-1 corresponding to 2.3 nm-2. The type-1 site density that provided the best fit to goethite adsorption of Cu, Pb and Cd was 0.00028 mol (mol Fe)-1 corresponding to 0.024 nm-2. For Zn adsorption on goethite the type-1 site density was significantly larger at 0.0015 mol (mol Fe)-1 corresponding to 0.13 nm-2. In all cases studied the presence of SO4 caused an increase in the extent of metal adsorption by goethite. This increased adsorption of metals in the presence of SO4 was accurately predicted by including ternary complex formation at both the high and low affinity adsorption sites. For both ferrihydrite and goethite the values of adsorption constants for ternary complex formation (logKxMeTC) were related to the adsorption constant for metal adsorption in the absence of SO4 (logKxMeINT). This was evident from a plot of logKxMeTC as a function of logKxMeINT for all metals, which showed a linear relationship with slope of 0.69 and intercept of 8.03. This relationship suggests that the enhancement of metal adsorption on both oxyhydroxides due to SO4 occurs by the same process.  When comparing Cu, Zn and Cd adsorption onto ferrihydrite and acicular goethite the effect of the larger goethite adsorption constants are approximately compensated for by the lower goethite site densities. Therefore the Cu, Cd and Zn adsorption isotherms on ferrihydrite and acicular goethite are fairly similar at low adsorption densities. In the case of Pb, the site densities and adsorption constants are both larger on ferrihydrite and there is a large difference between the ferrihydrite and acicular goethite adsorption isotherms.  Sulfate-rich goethite had considerably higher site densities, per mol of oxide, than the pure acicular goethite. Adsorption onto the sulfate-rich goethite could be modelled reasonably accurately using the parameters developed to model adsorption onto the pure acicular goethite but with a higher surface area and a higher ratio of type-1 to type 2 sites. In general, therefore, the parameters developed for pure goethite are apparently similar to those for the sulfate-rich goethite, but are not directly transferable. The difficulty in measuring the surface area of the highly aggregated sulfate-rich goethite makes comparisons between the two goethites more difficult.  The adsorption of Cu, Zn and Cd onto the SO4-rich goethite exceeds that of ferrihydrite because the higher adsorption constants of goethite are combined with the considerably higher site densities of the SO4-rich goethite compared to the acicular goethite. In contrast the higher site densities of the SO4-rich goethite does not completely compensate for the low logKINT values of Pb adsorption on goethite. Therefore SO4-rich goethite adsorption of Pb is lower than that of ferrihydrite.  When applied to literature data from AMD oxides the parameters derived in this thesis have significantly improved the ability of the DLM to predict trace metal adsorption in AMD systems, compared to using ferrihydrite as a proxy for all iron oxyhydroxides and adsorption data derived only from single sorbate systems.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acid mine drainage</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">ferrihydrite</field><field name="subject">goethite</field><field name="subject">sulfate</field><field name="subject">copper</field><field name="subject">cadmium</field><field name="subject">lead</field><field name="subject">zinc</field><field name="subject">AMD</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2553</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Brave New Zealand: the construction of a New Zealand identity</field><field name="creator">Skilling, Peter D.</field><field name="description">In 1999, Helen Clark&#8217;s New Zealand Labour Party came to power at the head of a coalition government. Central to the new government&#8217;s agenda was the strengthening of national identity. In the face of increasing globalisation and individualism, the Government saw national identity as something that should be both internally protected (as the guarantor of social cohesion) and externally projected (as a source of value in global markets). The two orientations were related in crucial ways, as New Zealand identity was increasingly narrated around the attitudes and behaviours - such as creativity, innovation and entrepreneurialism - deemed necessary for global economic competitiveness. Drawing on elements of both liberal and critical political theory, and paying particular attention to the discourses deployed by political actors, I describe and critically analyse Labour&#8217;s nation-building project, situating it within a broader project of economic transformation, which was itself a response to a reading of globalisation. Through a detailed examination of the Government&#8217;s political practice in its main statements of intent and in three key policy areas &#8211; cultural, food production and immigration policy - between 1999 and 2007, I ask two questions. Firstly, what constraints were imposed on the assertion of a unique national identity by the Government&#8217;s simultaneous embrace of global economic liberalism? And, secondly, what have been the implications of this assertion for the rights and liberties of individuals and groups within and beyond the state?  Implicit in the nation-building project was an attempt to manage internal difference for the sake of &#8220;the nation&#8221;. Internal diversity could be accepted &#8211; even celebrated &#8211; in the Government&#8217;s project, but only insofar as it was willing and able to contribute to an officially sanctioned vision of a shared national purpose. On this corporate conception of the state, individuals were no longer seen as subjects related by the common recognition of rules of conduct, but as role-performers related in the pursuit of a putative common purpose. The emphasis placed on the trope of the nation asserted a commonality of vision and interests that elided questions of the distribution of costs and benefits, and that marginalised dissenting ideas and perspectives.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2577</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Not just &#8216;old men in raincoats&#8217;: effectiveness of specialised community treatment programmes for sexually abusive children and youth in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Fortune, Clare-Ann Gabrielle</field><field name="description">This study addresses the hitherto limited research on sexually abusive children and youths in New Zealand (NZ). It encompasses children (12 years or younger) and youths (13 to 19 years) referred to the three largest specialised community sexual offender treatment programmes in Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch over a 9&#189; year period. Additionally, three special populations are considered: female sexually abusive youth, youth with &#8216;special needs&#8217; and children (12 years and under).  To increase our understanding of the individual, offending and family characteristics of these children and youths in specialised community treatment programmes in New Zealand Study One audited client&#8217;s clinical files (N = 702). Consistent with international research, New Zealand children and youth who engaged in sexually abusive behaviours not only presented with sexually abusive behaviour(s) but also had other psychological and behavioural issues. These included a history of childhood sexual and physical abuse (38%, n = 263 and 39%, n = 272 respectively), behavioural (63%, n = 442) and mental health problems (65%, n = 457), drug and alcohol misuse (22%, n = 156) and a history of suicide ideation or deliberate self-harm (27%, n = 187). They often had poor social skills (46%, n = 326) and had struggled to establish appropriate peer relationships (44%, n = 306).  Many of the children and youth came from multi-problem and chaotic family backgrounds (e.g., 55%, n = 387 of parents were divorced or separated, 38%, n = 267 were exposed to domestic violence and 32%, n = 222 had family member(s) with a substance abuse problem) and had experienced numerous out-of-home placements (57%, n = 389). Factors associated with resiliency were also investigated. It was found that children and youth primarily victimised male and female children (12 years or younger) (70%, n = 1407), who were acquaintances (57%, n = 1295) or relatives (32%, n = 730). Very few victimised strangers (7%, n = 86 of victims were strangers). They engaged in both &#8216;hands on&#8217; (e.g., penetrative acts) and &#8216;hands off&#8217; offences (e.g., voyeurism). Study Two was a naturalistic treatment outcome study to explore treatment outcomes and involved 682 sexually abusive children and youth who attended three specialised community treatment programmes in New Zealand. The main outcome of interest was sexual recidivism (prevalence rate of re-offending during the follow-up period) with secondary outcome variables of general and violent recidivism. The follow-up period ranged from 1 year to 10 years (mean 4.5 years, SD = 2.2). Three groups were compared: the &#8216;Comparison&#8217; group (referral or assessment only, n = 300), &#8216;Treatment Dropout&#8217; group (those who prematurely terminated their involvement in treatment, n = 165) and the &#8216;Treatment Completer&#8217; group (those successfully completing treatment, n = 217). To allow for triangulation of offences that were dealt with through the youth and adult justice system&#8217;s recidivism data were collected from multiple sources (Child, Youth and Family , Youth Court, and Police criminal charges and convictions data). Post-treatment sexual, general (nonsexual and non-violent) and violent recidivism are reported from each data source as well as overall sexual, general and violent recidivism. Sexual, general and violent re-offending that occurred while the children and youths were attending treatment are also presented. Changes in behavioural problems and the psychological functioning of sexually abusive children and youth between assessment and the end of treatment (as assessed by the Child Behavior Checklist, Youth Self Report and Millon Adolescent Clinical Inventory) contribute additional outcome measures. This naturalistic outcome study found that the treatment programmes were effective in reducing sexual recidivism amongst sexually abusive children and youth who completed treatment compared with those who did not complete treatment. Less than 3% (2.8%, n = 8) of Treatment Completers sexually re-offended compared with 6% (n = 17) of the Comparison group and 10% (n = 16) of the Treatment Dropout group. Treatment Dropouts were found to be at highest risk of sexual, general and violent recidivism. Recidivism for the three special populations (children, females and &#8216;special needs&#8217; youth) are also presented. The results from the psychological measures indicate a general pattern of reduction in behavioural and psychological problems between assessment and end of treatment. Logistic regression analysis was used in Study Three (N = 682) to explore factors associated with the risk of sexual and nonsexual (violent and general offending) re-offending post-treatment and dropping out of treatment. The factor predictive of sexual recidivism risk was having three or more victims and was associated with a decreased risk of sexual recidivism. Older age at first known sexual offence was associated with increased chance of nonsexual recidivism. Dropping out of treatment and having a history of nonsexual offending were associated with a decreased risk of nonsexual recidivism. Older age at referral and having no external mandate to attend treatment were associated with increased risk of youth dropping out of treatment. A history of mental health problems was associated with a decreased risk of treatment dropout. Conclusions This is the first study of the characteristics and treatment outcomes of sexually abusive children and youth in New Zealand. Its strengths include the large sample size, length of the follow-up period, use of a comparison group and data triangulation to determine recidivism. This study, therefore, compares favourably with international studies. This research enhances understanding of the individual, family and offending characteristics of sexually abusive youth in New Zealand as well as children, females and special needs youth. The Cognitive Behavioural Theory (CBT) based approach of the community programmes in New Zealand was found to be effective in reducing recidivism amongst children and youths who completed treatment. Specific recommendations relevant to treatment programmes and statutory agencies around programme development, referral processes and identification of sexually abusive children and youth are made. Directions for future research are also discussed. These include research exploring outcomes, other than recidivism, for those attending the Maori programmes, possible exploration of typologies within New Zealand sexually abusive children and youth, and subsequent follow-up research.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Youth offending</field><field name="subject">Recidivism</field><field name="subject">Sexual offending</field><field name="subject">Sexually abusive behaviour</field><field name="subject">Children and Youth</field><field name="subject">Outcome study</field><field name="subject">Treatment</field><field name="subject">Adolescence</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2609</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic pricing of wireless network resources in a competitive provider setting</field><field name="creator">Roggendorf, Matthias</field><field name="description">The ongoing convergence of cell-based wireless systems, from proprietary standards for data transmission toward a unifying approach based on the Internet Protocol (IP), as well as the increasing ability of wireless computer networks to support Quality-of-Service, opens up a tremendous potential for new business models and is expected to significantly alter the way mobile and wireless services are provided. An important field of study is about understanding the implications on the competitive structure of the wireless market. With the technical barriers between di erent technologies more and more diminishing, it becomes possible for customers to select network access on-demand instead of entering long-term contracts with a single wireless network provider based on factors such as connection speed, level of mobility and prices. In such a setting, wireless network providers, but also the regulatory bodies designing the principle market rules, need to learn about new ways of allocating resources among customers to reach their objectives. With resources being available on-demand, pricing becomes an important factor for controlling demand and distributing resources among users. Instead of being fixed over longer periods, pricing can be used for signalling the congestion levels in di erent wireless networks and to let users communicate their willingness-to-pay to the market. Besides presenting a classification framework for pricing in wireless networks and providing a comprehensive review of the relevant literature, the main contributions of this thesis are on the development of behavioural strategies, which di erent entities can follow in the described scenarios. In the first scenario we regard wireless resources as a public good, which should be efficiently allocated among active customers. By letting each provider use a second price auction, with each customer being able to bundle resources from multiple providers, we develop a bidding strategy, which allows customers to distribute their demand among providers. The bidding strategy resembles truth-telling in such a market and is shown to be the best strategy a user can follow to fulfill his demand. We examine the properties of the system analytically and present the results of an extensive simulation study. In the second scenario we model a free market for wireless resources on which prices are determined at the time of request. With customers having more than one option to obtain resources, the task of a provider becomes setting prices so that it maximises revenue under partial or full competition. We discuss the constrained maximisation problem and analyse the situation of a two-provider setting as a game. Simulation is used to analyse the game under uncertainty and to understand if a steady-state situation arises. While the results make use of multiple simplifications to allow us to understand the main model variables, the findings can potentially be of interest for providers and market authorities to develop new ways for resource allocation using dynamic pricing as a tool for reaching their design objectives.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wireless</field><field name="subject">Pricing</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2880</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Primary-school children's conceptions of light and their relation to the historical progression of optics</field><field name="creator">Noble, Ann-Marie</field><field name="description">The current study assessed children&#8217;s ideas on light and optics using a cross-sectional design.  Given current literature and theory within cognitive psychology, history of science and science education, it was expected that (i) older children would be more likely than younger children to have a modern scientific understanding of light concepts; (ii) for many of the light concepts, there would be a parallel between the pattern of progression and change in children&#8217;s conceptions of light and scientists&#8217; conceptions of light throughout history, and, finally; (iii) employing a historical lens would allow for a better understanding of not only the age-related patterns in children&#8217;s ideas of light but also children&#8217;s age specific alternative conceptions of light. A Light Core Concepts Questionnaire (LCCQ) was administered to participants (N=757) from across a wide age group (6 to 12 years).  The participants were representative of ethnic groups attending a range of primary schools situated in a large New Zealand city.  None of the participants had received classroom instruction in light and optics.  The verbally delivered LCCQ was used to elicit children&#8217;s responses about prerequisite concepts necessary for a scientific understanding of the physics of light and employed two-choice, multi-choice and open-ended questions.  Some questions were specifically designed to compare children&#8217;s conceptual understanding on light and optics with ideas adopted throughout the history of science. The results of the current research found that with increasing age (6 to 12 years old) children&#8217;s modern scientific understanding for many concepts on the physics of light increases.  In comparison with other research, a higher proportion of children participating in the current study held correct views at younger ages.  On easily observable phenomena, children as young as 7 years could identify common light sources and knew that some objects are reflectors of light.  By age 12, the majority of children could correctly identify more abstract concepts such as what causes colours in rainbows. Results of the present research indicate there is a parallel between the age-related patterns of children&#8217;s ideas on light and the historical progression of scientific knowledge of the physics of light.  With regard to light and vision, both early scientists and children held a similar range of alternative beliefs, that is, extramission, intromission or Eastern Islamic theories.  Similar beliefs were shared about other concepts that were accepted as true theories in the history of science.  For example, colour is the property of the object and when an object is placed in water it becomes distorted because water is less perfect than air. The results indicate that the pattern of alternative conceptions held by children as they relate to history provides further understanding of why there are differences in children&#8217;s beliefs about light and optics across age groups.  For more difficult concepts, children and early scientists initially formulate similar theories based on their observations and what appears to be commonsense.  As they reconceptualise their ideas, children and scientists formulate similar more abstract theories.  In addition to discussing the value of the history of science as a lens to better understand children&#8217;s conceptions, the implications of these results are discussed as they relate to specific kinds of interventions or instructional approaches to elicit successful conceptual change in the classroom.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">science education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2626</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative morphological, anatomical and embryological studies of Prumnopitys taxifolia and P. ferruginea (Podocarpaceae), and the hydrodynamics of their saccate pollen grains</field><field name="creator">Salter, Joshua</field><field name="description">Prumnopitys taxifolia (Banks et Sol. ex D. Don) de Laub. (matai) and P. ferruginea (D. Don) de Laub. (miro) are two New Zealand podocarps with morphologically very different reproductive structures. In P. taxifolia the pollen cones are sessile on spicate fertile branches, whereas in P. ferruginea they are solitary on short scaly peduncles. Likewise, in P. taxifolia the ovulate strobilus is an attenuated spicate structure bearing globose seeds, whereas in P. ferruginea the reduced ovulate strobilus bears a dorsi-ventrally flattened, usually solitary seed on a slender scaly peduncle. Such differences throw doubt on the validity of the current delimitations of the genus Prumnopitys. A comparative embryological study of these two species was done in parallel with a morphological and anatomical study of the reproductive structures to fill gaps in their known reproductive life cycles, and to determine whether there are any differences in the male and female cones or in their embryogeny that are of taxonomic significance at the generic level. In addition the hydrodynamic properties of their saccate pollen grains were compared with that of the pollen of several other conifers and the spores of three ferns and one lycopod. Morphology and Embryology Embryologically these two species are shown to be more similar to each other and to the Chilean Prumnopitys andina than to other podocarp genera. For instance, in both species: the long tapered archegonia have prominent neck cells with a thickened cap overlying them; five free nuclear mitoses occur before cell formation in the proembryo; meiosis can result in both linear and non-linear tetrads of megaspores; the microgametophyte typically forms 7 or 8 prothallial cells before dispersal. However, new morphological and anatomical differences have emerged from this study. In the pollen cones of P. taxifolia, the microsporangia are free with a transverse stomium located close to the cone axis; in P. ferruginea they are fused with the transverse stomium located basally. In P. taxifolia ovules, a tanniniferous layer develops in the epimatium and not in the integument, and fusion of epimatium/integument/nucellus is greatest dorsi-ventrally; in P. ferruginea ovules a prominent tanniniferous layer develops only in the integument, and fusion of epimatium/integument/nucellus is greatest laterally. Furthermore, observations of insect predation point to biochemical differences between P. taxifolia and P. ferruginea. An undescribed species of gall midge appears to be specialized exclusively for the P. taxifolia life cycle, and several other insect larvae prey on the developing and mature seeds, whereas the ovules/seeds of P. ferruginea appear to have almost no insect predators. Morphologically, anatomically and biochemically, P. taxifolia and P. ferruginea may therefore be sufficiently different to warrant being two separate genera; comparable differences have been used to distinguish other genera in the Podocarpaceae. Since embryogeny is likely to be under less evolutionary pressure than morphology and anatomy, and since P. taxifolia (along with P. andina) is regarded by some as basal in the conifers, with P. ferruginea less so, their embryological similarity does not necessarily indicate close relationship, only that they are closer to each other than to the other podocarps. Although their morphological and anatomical differences may be of taxonomic significance, a better understanding of the other species currently in Prumnopitys is necessary before the relationships within the genus can be clarified. Pollen Hydrodynamics Despite the morphological differences in their ovulate cones, P. taxifolia and P. ferruginea have very similar pollination mechanisms involving an inverted micropyle, a pollination drop and saccate pollen. Saccate grains have sometimes been referred to as 'non-wettable' due to their buoyant properties, while non-saccate pollen grains have been described as 'wettable'. The hydrodynamic properties of saccate pollen grains of seven podocarp species in five genera, Dacrydium Sol. ex G. Forst., Dacrycarpus (Endl.) de Laub., Manoao Molloy, Podocarpus L'H&#233;r. ex pers. and Prumnopitys Phil. have been tested in water, together with saccate and non-saccate pollen of four other conifer genera, Cedrus Trew (Pinaceae), Cephalotaxus Siebold &amp; Zucc. ex Endl. (Cephalotaxaceae), Cupressus L. (Cupressaceae) and Phyllocladus Rich. ex Mirb. (Phyllocladaceae), and spores of three fern species and one lycopod species. All four spore types studied were non-wettable, whereas the bisaccate and trisaccate pollen types, like all the other conifer pollen types, were wettable, enabling the grains to cross the surface tension barrier of water. Once past this barrier, grain behaviour was governed by presence or absence of sacci. Non-saccate and vestigially saccate grains sank, whereas saccate grains behaved like air bubbles, floating up to the highest point. In addition, the grains were observed to float in water with sacci uppermost, consistent with the suggestion that distally-placed sacci serve to orientate the germinal furrow of the pollen grain towards the nucellus of an inverted ovule. Observations of pollen grains in the pollen chambers of naturally pollinated Prumnopitys ovules confirmed this. The combination of buoyancy and wettability in saccate pollen has implications for the efficiency of the typical podocarp pollination mechanism. Since saccate pollen, inverted ovules and pollination drops are also characteristic of the Pinaceae, the similarities in the pollination mechanisms and the pollen grains of P. taxifolia and P. ferruginea have no taxonomic significance at the generic level.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2566</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In a different voice: a case study of Marianne and Jane Williams, missionary educators in northern New Zealand, 1823-1835.</field><field name="creator">Fitzgerald, Tanya G.</field><field name="description">This thesis is a case study that examines the educative activities of two Church Missionary Society (CMS) women, Marianne Coldham Williams and her sister-in-law Jane Nelson Williams, during the period 1823-1835. This study examines the role and status of these two missionary women in the early CMS mission station at Paihia in northern New Zealand. Marianne and Jane Williams were missionary educators whose primary task was to establish schools for local Maori pupils and resident missionary pupils. These first mission schools were established according to a perceived hierarchy of "need." Consequently, the first schools, established in 1823 were for Nga Puhi women and girls followed by a school for the missionary daughters in 1826. A school for Nga Puhi men and boys was not established until 1827 and a school for the missionary sons was delayed until 1828. Through the re-formation of Maori women as Christian women, Maori society was to replicate the "pleasantries" of (Pakeha) "Christian society." The schoolroom, not the pulpit became the central site to instigate changes in Maori society and the CMS initially charged Marianne and Jane Williams with the responsibility for this task. One of the strategies developed by Marianne and Jane Williams to survive in a frontier society was to form a network based on their sister-hood. Through the exchanging of letters between the two women in New Zealand and their "sisters" in England, a reciprocal friendship was created that provided Marianne and Jane with the support they sought. These letters and diaries provide valuable autobiographical accounts of the daily lives and missionary activities of Marianne and Jane. This study, therefore, presents a challenge to prevailing historical narratives that position men at the centre of missionary activities. Missionary policy documents and manuscript material written by early nineteenth century missionary women and men reveal that in New Zealand women played a critical role in the "Christianising" and "civilising" policies and practices. In placing women at the centre of historical inquiry and as historical agents, this study re-presents the historical narrative in a different voice.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2568</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Le Matuamoepo: competing 'spirits of governing' and the management of New Zealand-based Samoan youth offender cases</field><field name="creator">Suaalii, Tamasailau M.</field><field name="description">This thesis considers the 'spirits of governing' that currently frame youth justice approaches to Samoan youth offending in New Zealand, today. It claims that, in the current management of Samoan youth offending cases, three main spirits of governing are in play. These are the spirits of neo-liberal risk management cultural appropriateness, and faaSamoa. All three spirits operate simultaneously, in multilayered and intersecting ways. Gaining insight into this complexity is critical to building an understanding of the points of tension that may arise in the operationalisation of 'culturally appropriate' youth justice policies in the case of Samoan youth offenders. To highlight the complex character of these spirits of governing and their relationships, the thesis first describes each spirit of governing and then considers how they compete, intersect and/or diverge through a close analysis of seven youth justice cases. Analysis of each of the seven cases is based on interviews with a Samoan youth offender, a family representative, their CYFS social worker, police youth aid officer, Youth Court youth advocate and a community intervention programme worker. The key sites of government examined in this work are those of the family, the Youth Court, the youth justice family group conference and a community intervention programme service. The thesis reveals that to gain nuanced understanding of the complexities of managing a Samoan youth offender case, it is not simply a question of knowing what 'spirits of governing' are at play, one also needs to examine how they play. I contend that these three 'spirits' have specific relationships with each other. In youth justice, neo-liberalism opened up space for cultural appropriateness which, in turn allowed for the circulation of the faaSamoa. These three 'spirits', however, can not be reduced to each other because of their differing understanding of governmental strategies, techniques and subjects. In particular, they differ on their understanding of the role of families, of collaboration and of cultural expertise. Consequently, for example, while these three 'spirits of governing' 'agree' on the value of cultural appropriateness, they do not 'agree' on how it should be defined and measured. Too often when politically sensitive programmes or policies, such as those involving ethnic-specific cases, do not work, the response from politicians and programme personnel alike is to couch their failures in overly simplistic terms. This work seeks to indicate the importance of developing culturally nuanced models of analysis that can engage in the complexities of governing across cultural divides, in the improvement of practice in the field and in the development of a sociology capable of enhancing cross-cultural understanding.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2570</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand defence acquisition decision making: politics and processes</field><field name="creator">Greener, Peter</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2569</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of near-surface ozone concentrations in the city of Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Adeeb, Farah</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2571</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A theory for schooling improvement: consistency and connectivity to improve instructional practice</field><field name="creator">Annan, Brian</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the problem of how to speed up the process through which professional educators learn how to significantly improve disadvantaged students&#8217; academic achievement. The problem is addressed through three questions: (i) What are the most effective national and international examples of school improvement? (ii) What is the condition of the evidence base for making claims of effectiveness? (iii) What can be learned about developing and implementing effective school improvement from those national and international examples? The thesis begins by searching international and national school improvement literature to find those initiatives with the strongest evidence of effectiveness. One initiative in England (the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategies) and four initiatives in the United States (Success For All, Direct Instruction, The School Development Programme &amp; a district-wide reform in New York District #2) were considered to have strong evidence of effectiveness. Two initiatives in New Zealand (the Numeracy Development Project &amp; the Strengthening Education in Mangere and Otara project commonly called SEMO) had evidence that showed promise. It is argued that patterns of investment in different types of evaluation and ease of access to achievement information account for the difference between the strong international evidence and promising evidence in New Zealand. A series of investigations in the middle of the thesis focus on the processes set up in the initiatives to help practitioners learn effective reform practices. Three models of learning processes are developed which reveal a strong preference for vertical learning in England and the United States and a more balanced vertical-horizontal learning preference in New Zealand. Despite those contrasts, three characteristics were found to be common to all seven effective initiatives. They are a sharp focus on instructional improvement, a set of standardised practices, and, learning connections to transfer the reform ideas into practice. The latter part of the thesis transforms those three characteristics into a theory for schooling improvement which contribute to a faster and more effective reform process.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2575</field></doc><doc><field name="title">TV love: television and technologies of intimacy</field><field name="creator">Crozier, Susan</field><field name="description">TV Love is a study of the emotional and imaginative possibilities summoned and sustained by television programmes, possibilities that are here gathered under the rubric of love. By taking seriously a vernacular claim to love particular television programmes, this thesis intervenes in conventional practices of academic television criticism. It does so in order to develop an approach that would allow a focus on what television programmes make possible for the viewers who love them. I argue that the transactions between viewers and television texts constitute forms of emotional training that not only reproduce social subjectification, but also enable diverse forms of intimate experience. This is especially important for those subjects who struggle to find forms of psychic sustenance in an off-screen context. The critical approach taken in this thesis is termed reparative, following the work of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, in so far as it describes a process of restoring value to much maligned cultural objects. As a rationale for critical practice, reparation recognises the inadequacy of the social context in which diverse subjects must make a possible world for themselves. In particular, reparation describes the processes by which queer subjects have been able to mark out the terms of their own possibility in the face of difficult social or psychic conditions. The value of reparative criticism is not limited to queer readers or viewers, although queerness frequently demonstrates what is at issue between the conventions of academic television criticism and the alternate mode developed in this thesis. While academic criticism most often focuses on the ideological lessons presumed to be delivered by television programmes, this frequently overlooks the smaller scale emotional work that subjects carry out every day. Television programmes can both enable this emotional work and be the subject of its labours. In order to develop a fuller and more useful practice of television criticism than currently exists, TV Love contends that it is necessary to attend to the affectively enlivening potential of television for its viewers. The first chapter considers television as a technology of intimacy in terms of its domestic location and critically analyses television scholarship that has sought to address the specificity of that context. The second chapter further develops this theoretical overview by examining approaches that more explicitly deal with the affective engagements television allows. It then moves on to outline the particular reparative approach taken in this thesis. Chapter Three considers the series of documentaries that began with Seven Up in 1964 and, in a departure from the conventional discussion of class associated with the documentaries, this chapter focuses on the affective training the series carries out over its four decade history. The situation comedy Bewitched is the focus of the fourth chapter, which explores the way in which sitcoms can be profoundly imbricated in the very experience of childhood and family life. The repetition of a favourite programme from childhood, even years later, can generate emotional returns that demonstrate this intimate connection. Chapter Five continues the discussion of situation comedy with an analysis of the seventies hit The Mary Tyler Moore Show. In particular this chapter attends to the reiterations of the Mary Richards character across other textual contexts in order to identify the emotional competencies the Mary character makes possible beyond her seventies context. Chapter Six takes on the heritage criticism that has framed academic thinking about the serial drama Brideshead Revisited and presents an alternate reading in which high-cultural forms serve to connote homosexuality. The final chapter examines a series of programmes about the late Diana, Princess of Wales in order to identify the affective politics those programmes might be seen to enable.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::379900 Other Studies In Human Society::379901 Gender specific studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2567</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Foraminifera from the Mahoenui Group North Wanganui basin</field><field name="creator">Topping, Robert Mark</field><field name="description">The Mahoenui Group is a body of Oligocene and early Miocene marine clastic sedimentary rock in which two formations are recognized. The first, the Taumatamaire Formation (Happy, 1971) consists of up to 1000m of blue grey calcareous mudstone together with two minor limestones, the Awakino Limestone Member (Hay, 1967) and the Black Creek Limestone Member (new name). The second Formation, the Taumarunui Formation (Nelson &amp; Hume, 1977) is made up of 1000m of flysch. Two facies types are seen in the flysch, the proximal and distal flysch facies. 350 species of Foraminifera are recorded in 167 samples from 47 sections. Their systematics are discussed and many are illustrated using scanning electron photomicrographs. 11 new species are recognised in the genera, Almaena, Anomalina, Epistominella, Gavelinopsis, Globocassidulina, Guttulina, Lamarckina, Lenticulina, Melonis and Verneuilina. One new subspecies of Bolivina reticulata is also recognised. These are not formally named here but will be described in papers to be published later. An appraisal of numerical techniques in taxonomy is made while considering the Globigerina woodi "group" from the Mahoenui. This supports the validity of 5 species of planktonic Foraminifera from New Zealand and illustrates the advantages and disadvantages of numerical classification. The paleoecology and paleobathymetry of the samples is investigated using both conventional and numerical methods. These two approaches are compared, contrasted and then integrated to form a paleogeographic reconstruction.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2574</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Internationalizing the entrepreneurial high technology, knowledge-intensive firm</field><field name="creator">Coviello, Nicole Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2581</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Whakapapa and the state: some case studies in the impact of central government on traditionally organised M&#257;ori groups</field><field name="creator">Carter, Lynette Joy</field><field name="description">This thesis examines modern iwi governance systems and their effect on whakapapa as an organisational framework in M&#257;ori societies. The main question addressed was; can whakapapa survive as an organisational process, or will it be stifled, as M&#257;ori societies struggle to establish a strong identity in contemporary New Zealand. As an organisational framework for M&#257;ori societies, whakapapa works through a series of principles that function through relationships between people, and between people and other elements that make up the world. Contemporary M&#257;ori groups continue to claim that they are whakapapa-based societies. This thesis examines that claim by investigating to what extent of "being M&#257;ori" today is about adherence to those principles and to whakapapa-based processes and relationships, and how much is it about being shaped by non-M&#257;ori constructs that have been formed by state-intervention and legislated changes to M&#257;ori social organisation. If being Maori today has as much or more to do with the latter, what place does whakapapa have in contemporary M&#257;ori society, and to what level and to what extent can the principles of whakapapa be upheld as the basis for contemporary M&#257;ori societies. A series of stories and case studies were used to answer the questions posed in the thesis. The case studies demonstrated the ways in which whakapapa worked in everyday situations, and how the people who take part in whakapapa-based relationships understood them to work. They also demonstrated how state intervention through legislation has challenged the way M&#257;ori groups structure themselves when new circumstances have required compromise and change. The institutionalised evolution of M&#257;ori societies is examined in more detail using one example of a modern tribal structure, Te R&#363;nanga o Ng&#257;i Tahu. The Ng&#257;i Tahu example typifies the implications for M&#257;ori if they choose to move from a whakapapa-based organisational model of governance to a centralised legalbureaucratic model of governance. The adoption of the new centralised governance structures, such as Te R&#363;nanga o Ng&#257;i Tahu, will mean that M&#257;ori hap&#363; and iwi societies are in danger of disappearing to be replaced by a generic group,shaped by legislation and integrated into the wider nation-state of New Zealand. Whakapapa can only remain at the core of M&#257;ori societies, if M&#257;ori allow it to, but when M&#257;ori adopt centralised "generic" system of governance, hap&#363; and iwi societies, become censored versions of their former selves.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2573</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Model-based strategies for automated segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance images</field><field name="creator">Lin, Xiang, 1971-</field><field name="description">Segmentation of the left and right ventricles is vital to clinical magnetic resonance imaging studies of cardiac function. A single cardiac examination results in a large amount of image data. Manual analysis by experts is time consuming and also susceptible to intra- and inter-observer variability. This leads to the urgent requirement for efficient image segmentation algorithms to automatically extract clinically relevant parameters. Present segmentation techniques typically require at least some user interaction or editing, and do not deal well with the right ventricle. This thesis presents mathematical model based methods to automatically localize and segment the left and right ventricular endocardium and epicardium in 3D cardiac magnetic resonance data without any user interaction. An efficient initialization algorithm was developed which used a novel temporal Fourier analysis to determine the size, orientation and position of the heart. Quantitative validation on a large dataset containing 330 patients showed that the initialized contours had only ~ 5 pixels (modified Hausdorff distance) error on average in the middle short-axis slices. A model-based graph cuts algorithm was investigated and achieved good results on the midventricular slices, but was not found to be robust on other slices. Instead, automated segmentation of both the left and right ventricular contours was performed using a new framework, called SMPL (Simple Multi-Property Labelled) atlas based registration. This framework was able to integrate boundary, intensity and anatomical information. A comparison of similarity measures showed the sum of squared difference was most appropriate in this context. The method improved the average contour errors of the middle short-axis slices to ~ 1 pixel. The detected contours were then used to update the 3D model using a new feature-based 3D registration method. These techniques were iteratively applied to both short-axis and long-axis slices, resulting in a 3D segmentation of the patient&#8217;s heart. This automated model-based method showed a good agreement with expert observers, giving average errors of ~ 1&#8211;4 pixels on all slices.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">medical</field><field name="subject">image</field><field name="subject">segmentation</field><field name="subject">automatic</field><field name="subject">cardiac</field><field name="subject">MRI</field><field name="subject">registration</field><field name="subject">atlas-based</field><field name="subject">model-based</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2641</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Revisioning evangelical theology: an exploration, evaluation and extension of the theological method of Stanley J. Grenz</field><field name="creator">Harris, Brian S.</field><field name="description">In spite of the rapid growth of evangelicalism there is a paucity of reflection on its theological method. The transition from modernity to postmodernity, with the accompanying call for a postfoundationalist rather than a foundationalist method, has provided additional challenges to evangelicalism. Canadian theologian Stanley J. Grenz has proposed a model for evangelical theological construction that utilizes scripture, tradition and culture as the sources for theology, and the Trinity, community and eschatology as its focal motifs. He supplements these with the belief that the Spirit guides the church, and that the community of faith will therefore be pneumatologically guided as it communally attempts to discern truth in a changed context. Grenz believes that his theological method moves beyond foundationalism as it appeals to a trio of interacting sources, rather than to the single source of scripture. In exploring and evaluating Grenz' theological method, this thesis tests the research proposition "that Stanley Grenz' theological method effectively revisions evangelical theology." To ascertain the validity of the proposition, it utilizes four evaluative questions which explore the originality, theological coherence, appropriateness and effectiveness of Grenz'method for evangelical theology. The application of his model in his text, Welcoming but Not Affirming, serves as a test case to determine the implications of his method. Concluding that Grenz' model makes only a modest contribution towards revisioning evangelical theological method, the concluding chapters of the research explore ways to supplement Grenz' model to allow a stronger affirmation of the research proposition. Utilizing Wolterstorff's concept of control beliefs, it proposes that Grenz' model would be more effective if he added a control belief to guide his theological construction, and motivates for adopting the control belief the gospel liberates.ln addition, it argues that Grenz' three focal motifs for theology need to be preceded by the gathering motif of the cross, arguing that if seen outside of this gathering motif, the motifs of Trinity, community and eschatology lack adequate substance. Noting the often acrimonious context in which theological revisioning takes place, the research ends with a plea for the empowerment of imagination in theological construction.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::440000 Philosophy and Religion::440200 Religion and Religious Traditions::440204 Christian theology (incl.

This group is established to contain the igneous and proximal sedimentary products of the lower to mid Miocene west Northland volcanic arc and is divided into three subgroups. The northern, Waipoua, Subgroup (new), consists of the Waipoua Basalt and associated volcaniclastic sediments of the Hokianga - Kaihu area. The central, Hukatere, Subgroup (new), contains volcaniclastic and igneous rocks of the Tokatoka &#8211; okahukura Peninsula area, Kaipara. The southern, Manukau, Subgroup, contains igneous rocks and associated volcaniclastic sediments of the Waitakere Hills and adjacent areas. The Waitakere Hills and their northern extension to Helensville (c.500 km2) have been systematically mapped at a scale of 1:25000 and found to consist of a number of tilted or gently folded blocks of Manukau Subgroup having a low, overall, west to north-west tilt. Five formations and thirteen members are established. The oldest sediments are volcanic-rich proximal turbidites (Cornwallis Formation, upper Po, lower Miocene) that overlie and interfinger with the more distal flysch of the Waitemata Group to the east. Cornwallis Formation, and many of the overlying sediments, accumulated at bathyal depths (800 &#8211; 3000 m+) on the western side of the Waitemata basin. The proximal turbidites were deposited by south-east flowing turbidity currents that passed down submarine canyons from the neritic Kaipara shelf in the north and north-west. Lenticular conglomerates (Albany Conglomerate, Helensville Conglomerate) accumulated in these canyons and distributary channels of the upper and mid fan regions. In uppermost Otaian to mid Altonian times (late lower Miocene), an apron of coarse volcaniclastic sediments (Piha Formation) spread eastwards over the Waitakere Hills area from a growing volcanic pile centred west of the present coastline. Piha Formation contains well-stratified rudites, subsidiary lenticular, cross-bedded and massive rudites, large slump deposits and peripheral submarine extrusions of and site flows, pillows and hyaloclastite. This coarse volcaniclastic belt was deposited on the neritic and upper.bathyal slopes of the volcanic pile and grades eastwards towards the centre of the basin into a fine volcaniclastic belt (Nihotupu Formation) containing well-bedded arenites and lutites, cross-bedded arenites, lenticular conglomerates, slump units and small piles of pillowed andesite. These were deposited at mid to lower bathyal depths. Substantial mid Altonian uplift in the Waitakere Hills was probably connected with eastwards advancing volcanism. The northern area around Muriwai remained marine for a time and several submarine canyons were eroded through the uplifted shelf and filled with pyroclastic-rich sediments (Tirikohua Formation). An extensive, predominantly terrestrial sheet of andesite flows and pyroclastics (Lone Kauri Formation) was erupted over the uplifted central Waitakere Hills area. This sheet vras possibly erupted from the two north-north-west trending, fault-controlled lineations of volcanic necks, craters, plugs, dyke swarms and intrusions that outcrop today along either side of the hills. Volcanian, strombolian and rare pelean eruptions from these centres produced mostly andesitic products plus one dacite dome (watchman Dacite); these were the last known phases of volcanism in the area (upper Pl - ?Sc, lower to mid Miocene). Macrofaunas have been collected from seventy-six localities in the Waitakere Hills. These can be divided into undisplaced bathyal biocoenoses and displaced thanatocoenoses in which neritic and bathyal faunas were mixed during subaqueous mass flow transport. Analysis of these faunas allows recognition of ten neritic and three bathyal macrofaunal biofacies. Remains of the crustacean Callianassa are recorded. From burrow networks (Thalassinoides) developed in bathyal sediments. Sparse ichnocoenoses composed entirely of feeding and dwelling structures produced by burrowing polychaetes, echinoids and possibly sipunculids occur in basin (mid - lower bathyal) and submarine canyon (outer neritic - upper bathyal) sediments around Maori Bay. A canyon wall ichnocoenosis (outer neritic &#8211; upper bathyal), produced in semi-consolidated sediments by burrowing polychaetes, decapod crustacea and possibly amphipods and other organisms, occurs south of Maori Bay. Twelve species from nine genera of hermatypic (reef-building) corals occur in mass flow deposits. They are inferred to have come from sporadically developed communities growing on shallow-water boulder banks around volcanic islands. Comparison of the total lower Miocene hermatypic coral fauna of Northland with present day reefs indicates that seasonal sea termperatures were 5 - 7&#176;c warmer than now. Taxonomic descriptions of fossil corals, molluscs, polychaetes, benthonic foraminifera and trace fossils are given. Archesabella bartrumi gen. et sp. nov. is proposed for fossil tubes containing the body casts of sabellid-like worms. The hermatypic coral genus Goniastrea, trace fossil genus Rhizocorallium, and molluscan subgenera Dentalium (Gadilina), Solariella (Solaricida) and Turbo (Marmarostoma), are recorded from New Zealand for the first time. A new subgenus and species of the gastropod Monilea and new species of the gastropod genera Conacmea, Notoacmea (Parvacmea), Tecticrater, solariella (Solaricida), Turbo (Marmarostoma), Agathirses, "Bartrumella" and Vaqinella are described. A new genus and species of nuculanid bivalve, and new species of the mollusca Nucula, Saccella, Dentalium (Gadilina), Turbo (Marmarostoma), Agathirses, Argobuccinum (Ratifusus), Uttleya and Concholepas are but not named. The New Zealand species of the pteropod Vaginella are redescribed and figured, and the ontogeny of the oyster Crenostrea, discussed. The foraminiferal genus Sherbornina is recorded from New Zealand for the first time, together with thirty-nine overseas species. A further seventeen unnamed foraminiferal species are described. Planktonic foraminifera allow division of the Manukau Subgroup into three biostratigraphic units: upper otaian, lower altonian and mid Altonian. Three-fold subdivision of Scott's Altonian is shown to be possible in northern New Zealand. The lower - middle Altonian boundary is based on the Globorotalia (T.) zealandica zealandica datum, supported by both the temporary absence of Globoguadrina dehiscens and the measurements on the rate of chamber expansion in Globigerinoides t. trilobus populations. The middle &#8211; upper Altonian boundary is taken as the Globorotalia (G.) miozea miozea datum, supported by both the reappearance of G. dehiscens and the rate of chamber expansion measurements. Uniformitarian and computer approaches allow the thirty-one richest benthonic foraminiferal samples to be grouped into eight neritic and bathyal thanatotopes. Separate analysis of each thanatotope enables approximate depth limits to be placed on each and gives basin depths of 1500 - 3000 m+. Multidimensional scaling technique using Edwards Great Circle distances was found to be the most useful computer method in clustering the samples. Formations of the Waipoua Subgroup are summarised, and the paleogeography and eruptive history of the Waitakere Group is inferred.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::269900 Other Earth Sciences::269901 Physical geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2597</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular genetics of restriction fragment length polymorphisms linked to the Huntington disease locus</field><field name="creator">Stapleton, Patricia M. (Patricia Mary)</field><field name="description">New Zealand families segregating the Huntington disease (HD) phenotype were investigated for linkage of the HD locus to the anonymous DNA locus G8, from chromosome 4p16.3. Linkage of the two loci was indicated in the largest family assessed. The results from this family together with those from 10 other smaller families were consistent with the existence of a single locus (that is, genetic homogeneity for HD). One crossover between the HD locus and the G8 marker locus was detected. Overall, the results of the linkage analysis indicate a distance of 4cM separating HD from G8. The usefulness of G8 as a marker in predictive testing for HD was examined in the New Zealand families. In agreement with overseas findings, G8 and DNA contiguous with G8 are useful for predictive testing in some families. The main limitation for predictive testing is the family structure which often results in the unavailability of key individuals for testing and thus prevents prediction in others. Sequence analysis of three sites which produce restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) detected by G8 revealed that single point mutations were responsible for the presence or absence of the polymorphic sites *H1, *H2 and *E. The sequences were highly conserved between individuals in the regions investigated. The conservation of sequence provided the potential for the use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify each polymorphic region for more rapid assessment of these RFLPs. The three regions were amplified successfully from genomic DNA. In addition, amplification of the three regions was possible with template DNA which was degraded or crude or isolated from tissue which had been fixed in formalin. However, the results of the subsequent analyses of the amplified products by restriction enzyme digestion showed that there are problems that can render the PCR unreliable. The presence of non-target sequences hindered detection of the genotype in the *H1 and *H2 regions and masked the true genotype of a person in the *E region. Thus, the potential of the PCR for presymptomatic diagnosis of HD remains to be realised. However, when the problems are overcome a very rapid analysis of RFLPs linked with HD using the PCR will be possible, as will be retrospective analyses.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2601</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polarographic studies in the anthraquinone series</field><field name="creator">Sprott, Thomas James</field><field name="description">Polarographic chemical analysis, although invented only twenty-five years ago, has already become a standard method ror the research worker and industrial analyst alike.

R. (Paul R.)</field><field name="description">Several ecological aspects of the Manukau Harbour related to its benthic flora end fauna, water chemistry, sedimentology, and bacteriology were investigated. Vertical colour aerophotographs were taken of all vegetated tidelands within the Harbour and six vegetation types were indentified, mapped, and discussed in terms of their ecological significance. Meadows of the intertidal seaweed Gracilaria secundata var. pseudoflagellifera near the Manukau Sewage Oxidation Ponds were found to have increased virtually logarithmically in extent since the commencement of operations of the Manukau Purification Works. The possible relation of this increase to contributions of mutrients and fine sediments from the Ponds is considered. The effects of stress, sediment type, and the presence of macrovegetation on benthic faunal community structure are studied. The majority of the findings are somewhat inconclusive; however it is found that mangrove swamps and eelgrass flats clearly appear to increase faunal species diversity. Water and sediment nutrients were examined and found to be at high levels in the north-east region of the Harbour. It is concluded that sediments probably undergo less temporal variation in nutrient levels than do overlying waters and might therefore provide a more cost-effective method of studying cultural eutrophication in the Manukau and similar harbours. Sediment particle size distribution was looked at and it was determined that sediments are extremely fine near the Manukau Sewage Oxidation Ponds, coarser but still muddy in most of the inlets of the Harbour, and sandy in most of the open Harbour intertidal flats remote from pollution sources. Counts of coliform bacteria were made and levels in intertidal sediments were found to be generally higher than in overlying waters but not less temporally variable. It was also determined that waters and sediments of the north-east region of the Harbour are of poor sanitary quality. Several management considerations are discussed in relation to the results of the study. Further research needs are outlined terms of 22 research projects addressed to waste water management, land erosion control, and tidelands managements.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2598</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perfumes related to ambergris.

This Introduction therefore considers the structures, interrelationships, and biogenesis of cyclopentanoid monoterpenoids possessing the 1,2-dimethyl-3-isopropylcyc clopentane carbon skeleton (1). Cyclopentanoid Monoterpenoids: Although acyclic and cyclohexanoid monoterpenoids have been characterised for nearly eight years, naturally occurring compounds possessing the carbon skeleton (1) have been defined relatively recently. Despite their frequently unusual chemical behaviour and physiological actions, which have often been recorded in the early literature, progress in the elucidation of their structures has awaited the application of modern physical techniques. The carbon skeletons are frequently highly oxygenated, and the characteristic chemistry of the compounds arises from the interactions of contiguous functional groups. Since the chemistry of the type compounds, nepetalactone (2), iridomyrmecin (3), and iridodial (4) has been reviewed, only more recent work will be discusse below.</field><field name="date">1963</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2591</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Time variations in cosmic ray extensive air showers.</field><field name="creator">Storey, John Richard</field><field name="description">Two motives are responsible for the investigation of cosmic rays. Firstly they provide the only source at present availabe of particles with extremely high energy. To study interactions between fundamental particles at energies greater than about  6 x 109 ev. therefore, one must turn to cosmic rays. Interest in geophysics and astrophysics provides the other motive. For example, a theory of the origin of cosmic rays must form an integral part of the astronomer's explnation of the universe. The  prob1em of the origin of the cosmic radiation is still looking at satisfactory solution. Further, much information about the physics of the solar system and the earth may be obtained from a world wide distribution of cosmic ray observatories.</field><field name="date">1957</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2582</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tui sociodynamics: foraging behaviour, social organisation, and use of song by tui in an urban area.</field><field name="creator">Bergquist, Carol A. L. (Carol Anne Lillias)</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the behavioural ecology of the tui, Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae, a member of the Meliphagidae (honeyeaters), in the suburban Auckland region of the mainland of New Zealand. Tui are highly nectarivorous but observations show differences in degree of importance between the three food categories; nectar, fruit and insects according to season. when foraging for nectar tui are not responsive to flower colour but use all flowers with nectar concentrations greater than 7% (wt. per wt.) and use fruit when nectar availability falls. Foraging observations are significantly different for male and female tui with males taking more nectar and females taking more insects, in response to greater protein requirement as well as a result of status affecting foraging. There is also a seasonal difference in method of prey capture with the more energetically expensive hawking occurring in times of greater nectar availability or when very few insects in relation to nectar are taken. Colour-banded tui are shown to move in family groups over distances ranging from 5 to 35km in search of nectar for much of the year, but are localised into small foraging areas during breeding when nectar is abundant. Group members remain together and nest near each other, female offspring nesting closer to parents than male offspring. There is differential access to both natural and artificial food resources and the various asymmetries of sex, age and residency determine relative status at food sources but are not absolute. Loud song is the most conspicuous behaviour and is used to mediate avoidance between individuals and between groups. An artificial food source is partitioned temporally and spatially during breeding with the local higher status birds that use the feeders having significantly greater breeding success. Unlike results published for most passerines, both sexes of tui sing throughout the year and songs in their repertoire show sexual, seasonal, behavioural and individual variation. Pairs duet and both sexes will match songs with mates and with neighbours; resulting in apparent dialect areas corresponding with group boundaries. Avian spirochaetosis is identified as one of the causes of death in a population with 13-30% annual loss. Losses are readily compensated for as the nesting cycle is short and the breeding season is long. This, together with an opportunistic foraging strategy, great mobility and prolonged association in family groups explains the continued presence of tui in suburban areas.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2576</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of geomagnetic micropulsations</field><field name="creator">Fraser-Smith, A.

A particular study is made of the hydromagnetic wave theory and of the probability of these waves being produced by gyrating charged particles in the magnetosphere. The conditions are discussed under which gyration-induced hydromagnetic waves have frequencies within the micropulsation range. Assuming the production of Alfv&#233;n waves by some process in the magnetosphere, a layer model is developed to investigate the transmission of these waves down along the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field lines to the ionosphere. One feature of this model is a realistic ionospheric termination, in which a phase shift and amplitude reduction may be introduced into back reflected waves. Calculations using the model indicate a definite harmonic structure associated with micropulsations and only a small variation of frequency with geomagnetic latitude; they also provide a good explanation of the frequency structure and diurnal variation of &#8216;pearls&#8217;.</field><field name="date">1965</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260200 Geophysics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2592</field></doc><doc><field name="title">X-ray structural investigations of bromo-oxoditerpenoids and the nickel (II) chelate of a pyridoxal-amino acid intermediate</field><field name="creator">Cutfield, John Franklin</field><field name="description">The crystal structure of bis-(pyridoxylidene-L-valine)nickel(II) hydrate (referred to as nickel(II) pyridoxylidene L-valine) has been determined but the difficulty in detecting small deviations from body-centred symmetry, and in locating all solvent molecules, has precluded an accurate analysis.

Subjects were placed in small for gestational age, pre-term appropriate for gestational age, control, pre-term small for gestational age, low birth weight with gastroenteritis and very low birth weight groups. Assessment was blind and, where necessary, groups were randomly selected. Data were gathered from four stages of the subjects&#8217; development; the pregnancy, the newborn period, pre-school and school age. Analysis of pregnancy data showed that some aspects of the intrauterine environment provided by a number of mothers was less than optimal. In the neonatal period, the low birth weight groups were at some disadvantage and, further, there were aspects where there was some evidence that either the treatment or the condition for which it was required could possiblY influence subsequent development. The pre-school period was marked by sex differences, particularly in cognitive functioning. Disadvantage in all instances was confined to the low birth weight male groups. Some events in the prenatal, perinatal and neonatal periods appeared to be associated with poorer performance on intelligence tests more than four years later. Among these influences were mothers' smoking habits, temperature, duration of tube feeding and gastroenteritis while in hospital. Assessment at school revealed the same pattern of cognitive development among the subgroups that had been apparent at the pre-school stage. The pre-term males found adjustment to school difficult and made slow progress in reading in comparison with the females belonging to the same group. At this age the term - small for gestational age group was still lagging behind in physical development. It was concluded that the low birth weight males constituted a group who were &#8216;at risk&#8217; because of slower cognitive development. This was particularly evident in so far as the pre-term males were concerned.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2599</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The arts in the New Zealand curriculum: from policy to practice</field><field name="creator">Mansfield, Janet Elaine</field><field name="description">In this thesis I portray through a history of music and art education in New Zealand the forms knowledge production took in these subject and the discourses within which they were embedded. This enables a more comprehensive understanding of curriculum and unearths connections with what Lyotard (1984) described as 'grand narrative' used to legitimate knowledge claims and practices at certain historical moments. Through such histories we may chart the progress of European civilization within the local context and provide the historical raison d'&#195;&#170;tre for the present state of affairs in music and arts areas of the New Zealand curriculum. Curriculum and its 'reform' representing in part the distribution of public goods and services, has been embroiled in a market project. I seek to expose the politics of knowledge involved in the construction of the notion of The Arts within a neo-liberal policy environment. This environment has involved the deliberate construction of a 'culture of enterprise and competition' (Peters, 1995: 52) and, in the nurturing of conditions for trans-national capital's freedom of movement, a withdrawal from Keynesian economic and social policy, an assault on the welfare state. The thesis delves beyond the public face of policy-making. It follows and scrutinizes critically the birth of The Arts in the New Zealand Curriculum to the production of the first draft of the proposed policy presented by the Ministry of Education in 1999. I examine it as a site of the 'accumulation of meaning' (Derrida, 1981: 57) through a discussion of the history of meaning of 'art' and 'art' education. There is much of value in the Draft document. In particular, the arts have been invested with a new intellectual weight and the professionalism, passion and dedication of those involved in its writing shines through in each of the subject areas within the arts. However, through a process of analysis, I will show that there has been, in fact, a fashioning of a new container for the isolation of artistic knowledge. This is despite official sentiments mentioning possibilities within the document for flourishing separate Music, Art, Dance, and Drama education that implies increased curriculum space. The Draft Arts (1999) document both disguises and rehashes the 'master narrative' of universal rationality and artistic canons and is unlikely to work towards revitalising or protecting local cultural identities though not through lack of intention. I use Lyotard's notion of 'performativity' to critique notions of 'skills' and their 'development' which are implicitly and explicitly stated within the 'levels' of development articulated in the Draft Arts (1999) document. It is argued that this conflation works to enforce cultural homogeneity. There are clear dangers that the Draft Arts' (1999) conception of 'Arts Literacies' might operate as mere functional literacy in the service of the dominant culture's discourse of power and knowledge-one which celebrates the art-as-commodity ideal. It is argued that the Education Ministry's theoretical and epistemological construction of The Arts as one area of learning is unsound, and in fact represents a tightening of modernism's hierarchical notion of culture. New Zealand, now post-colonial or post-imperialist, both bi-cultural and multi-cultural, is situated on the south-western edge of the Pacific Rim. Culturally, it now includes Pacific Island, Asian, and new immigrants, as well as Maori and people of European descent. This therefore necessitates aesthetic practices which, far from promoting a set of universal principles for the appreciation of art - one canonical rule or 'standard' - recognise and reflect cultural difference. Merely admitting cultural difference is inadequate. By working away critically at the deeply held ethno-centric assumptions of modernism, its selective traditions concerned with 'practices, meanings, gender, "races", classes' (Pollock, 1999: 10), its universalising aesthetics of beauty, formal relations, individuality, authenticity or originality, and self-expression, of 'negativity and alienation, and abstraction' (Huyssens, 1986: 209), it is possible to begin to understand the theoretical task of articulating difference with regard to aesthetics. The development of the arts curriculum in New Zealand is placed within the modernism/postmodernism and modernity/postmodernity debates. These debates have generated a number of questions which are forcing us to re-examine the assumptions of modernism. The need for the culture of modernism to become self-critical of its own determining assumptions in order to come to understand its cultural practices, is becoming an urgent theoretical task, especially in disciplines and fields concerned with the transmission of acquired learning and the production of new knowledge. The culture of modernism is often taken as the historical succession of twentieth century avant-gardes (B. Smith, 1998) yet the culture of modernity, philosophically speaking, strictly begins with Ren&#195;&#169; Descartes several hundred years earlier, with a pre-history in the Florentine renaissance and the re-discovery of Graeco-Roman artistic and literary forms going back to the thirteenth century. Aesthetic modernism identifies with consumer capitalism and its major assumptions are rationalist, individualist and focus upon the autonomy of both the 'work of art' and the artist at the expense of the artwork, its reception and audience within its localised cultural context. The ideological features of humanism/liberalism - its privileging of the individual subject, the moral, epistemological and aesthetic privileging of the author/artist - are examined as forces contributing to modernism's major values (or aesthetic). Such approaches, it is argued, were limited for dealing with difference. The security and reproductive nature of modernistic approaches to curriculum in the arts areas are destabilized by thinking within the postmodern turn, and the effects of the changes questioning the basic epistemological and metaphysical assumptions in disciplinary fields including art/literature, artchitecture, philosophy and political theory, are registered here, within the field of the education in and through the arts. In a seminal description or report on knowledge, Jean-Fran&#195;&#167;ois Lyotard defines postmodernism as 'incredulity towards metanarratives' (1984: xxiv). Postmodernism, he argues, is 'undoubtedly part of the modern', 'not modernism at its end but in its nascent state and that state is constant (1984: 79). After Lyotard, postmodernism might be seen, therefore, not just as a mode or manner or attitude towards the past, but also as a materializing discourse comprising a dynamic reassessment and re-examination of modernism and modernity's culture. The thinking subject (the cogito) seen as the fount of all knowledge, its autonomy, and transparency, its consideration as the centre of artistic and aesthetic virtuosity and moral action, is subjected to intellectual scrutiny and suspicion. The need for an aesthetics of difference is contextualised through an examination of western hierarchies of art and the aesthetics of marginalized groups. I use the theories of poststructuralist, Jacques Derrida and Jean-Fran&#195;&#167;ois Lyotard, to examine the concept of difference. These theoretical inspirations are used as methodological tools for offsetting the privileging of the liberal individual and individualism. Rather than the mere consideration of difference in curricula, I seek to insert and establish the principle of an aesthetics of difference into relations of pedagogy and curricula. The implications for professional practice resulting from a recognition of a politics of representation are examined and a politics of difference. I argue that art education in all its manifestations can no longer avoid the deeper implications of involvement with representation, including forms of gender, ethnicity and class representation as well as colonial representation. The Western canon's notion of 'artists' and their 'art', often based upon white bourgeois male representations and used in many primary school classrooms, are part and parcel of 'social and political investments in canonicity', a powerful 'element in the hegemony of dominant social groups and interests' (Pollock, 1999: 9). Difference is not appreciated in this context. School art, music, and drama classrooms can become sites for the postmodern questioning of representation of 'the other'. In this context, an aesthetics of difference insists upon too, the questioning of images supporting hegemonic discourses, images which have filled the spaces in the 'chinks and cracks of the power/knowledge-apparati' (Teresa de Lauretis, 1987 cited in Pollock, 1999: 7-8). What would an 'eccentric rereading', a rediscovery of what the canon's vicarly cloak disguises and reveals, mean for music, and for the individual arts areas of the curriculum? I hope to reveal the entanglements of the cultural dynamics of power through an examination of the traditions of Truth and Beauty in imagery which are to be disrupted by inserting into the canon the principle of the aesthetics of difference. Art education as a politics of representation embraces art's constitutive role in ideology. This is to be exposed as we seek to unravel and acknowledge which kinds of knowledges are legitimised and privileged by which kinds of representations. Which kinds of narratives, historical or otherwise, have resulted in which kinds of depictions through image? A recognition of the increasing specification of the subject demands also the careful investigation of colonial representation, the construction of dubious narratives about our history created through visual imaging and its provision of complex historical references. How have art, music, dance, drama been used in the service of particular political and economic narratives? Through revisioning the curriculum from a postmodern perspective, suggestions are made for an alternative pedagogy, which offsets the ideological features of humanism/liberalism, one in which an aesthetics of difference might pervade cultural practices - 'systems of signification', 'practices of representation' (Rizvi, 1994). I draw upon Lyotard's notion of 'small narratives' (1984), and present an investigation of what the democratic manifestation of 'the differend', and multiple meaning systems, might indicate in terms of 'differencing' music education as a site in which heterogenous value systems and expression may find form.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2585</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The geography of power resources in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Farrell, Bryan H.</field><field name="description">For a century the development of power resources has contributed much to the geography of New Zealand.

Nor is the situation static.  Large dams and associated villages stand in areas which only a decade ago were remote and uninhabited, lakes are being drained and swamps reclaimed in the search for coal, and a man-made thermal area has been created, as spectacular as any natural one.

Whale and others at the Seagrove Radio Research Station (now the Radio Research Centre, University of Auckland), to the examination of some of the problems involved in HF radio propagation. Among these were the evaluation of the effects of large-scale ionospheric tilts, the scattering which occurs at the earth and ionosphere, and the measurement and prediction of incoming bearing and elevation angles of signals from distant stations. In the latter stages of this work it became obvious that little was known about effects occurring at antipodal distances, so attempts were made to examine these and to postulate a propagation model consistent with the effects observed. The results presented in this thesis are a logical extension of this early work, and comprise investigations in three main areas: (1) The shape and size of the antipodal focussing area, (2) The development of a more general and less idealised propagation model, (3) The shape of the incoming angular power spectrum at antipodal distances.

As is usual with this class of compound its occurrence is confined almost entirely to the native New Zealand flora and although only two types of tree have been used as sources, it has been identified, often only in small amounts, in at least ten different species. Its co-occurrence with other diterpenes of similar chemical and physical properties has often made it hard to isolate and this, together with its geographic distribution has probably tended to limit its availability for research purposes, and hence delayed the elucidation of its structure. The awareness of the existence of this compound of undetermined structure has, therefore, caused a noticable gap in the knowledge of the diterpenoids, and this hiatus has been accentuated by Wenkert who, believing it to have a pimarane skeleton, suggested that it might be the important biogenetic precursor of a number of tetracyclic diterpenoids. Recent work, confirmed by the present investigation has, however, shown that previous structural predictions were incorrect and in actual fact rimuene has a rosane skeleton. As Ruzicka has shown for this class of compound, it has probably been formed from a pimarane diterpenoid and therefore represents a later biogenetic step than the other diterpene hydrocarbons which are always found with it in nature.</field><field name="date">1967</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2593</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The crystal structures of the bromo and chloro derivatives of picrotoxinin / Bryan Maxwell Craven</field><field name="creator">Craven, Bryan Maxwell</field><field name="description">Picrotoxin is the bitter tasting convulsive poison, obtained from the cocculus berries, the fruit of  the East Indian creepers, Menispermum cocculus and Anamirta paniculata.

From this analysis 20 taxa are recognised as constituting the New Zealand Monotis fauna, with the future possible addition of two further taxa. M. richmondiana Zittel, claimed by some overseas workers as a junior synonym of M. ochotica (Keyserling), is established as validly separable and is seen to include Trechmann's (1918) Pseudomonotis ochotica var. acutecostata as a subspecies. The presence of the New Caledonian M. routhieri and M. ochotica gigantea (Avias, 1953) is confirmed and the latter is transferred to M. subcircularis Gabb. Monotis salinaria var. hemispherica and var. intermedia (of Trechmann, 1918) are reinstated as valid taxa and given full specific rank. M. calvata Marwick (1953) is retained as a full species. In addition, the following species and subspecies are proposed: awakinoensis, kiritehereensis, maniapotoi, marwicki, murihikuensis, murihikuensis taringatura, pinensis aotearoa, rauparaha, rauparaha aries, rauparaha mokaui, subcircularis discordans, wairakae, and warepana. Only Pseudomonotis richmondiana var. truncata Frech (1908) amongst names previously proposed for New Zealand Monotis is rejected as a nomen dubium; it is probably synonymous with M. richmondiana acutecostata (Trechmann). The species-group concept of Westermann (1973b) is formalised by the proposal of five subgeneric divisions to accommodate the 55 definite and up to 5 possible taxa included in the genus. The subgenera Monotis, Entomonotis Marwick (type: M. richmondiana), Eomonotis n.subgen. (type: Pseudomonotis scutiformis var. typica Kiparisova), Inflatomonotis n.subgen. (type: Monotis salinaria var. hemispherica Trechmann), and Maorimonotis n.subgen. (type: Monotis routhieri) are differentiated on the basis of adult size, prominence and sculpture of the posterior auricle, the degree to which it is separated from the disc, shell inflation, radial ribbing and shell thickness. Eomonotis is the oldest subgenus and the stem-stock for the others; it probably evolved from Otapiria. It is unclear from morphologic evidence whether Monotis (s.s.) and Entomonotis developed one from the other or both from Eomonotis independently. Maorimonotis is confidently believed to have sprung from an Entomonotis similar to M. pachypleura (Teller) and Inflatomonotis is most likely to have evolved from an Eomonotis with strongly inflated left valve (e.g. M. jakutica (Teller) or M. iwaiensis Ichikawa). Eomonotis and Entomonotis are geographically the most widespread, the former being absent only from the Andean area of Monotis distribution and Entomonotis not having been recorded in the western or central Tethys. Monotis (s.s.) is common only in the western Tethys. Inflatomonotis and Maorimonotis are confined to New Zealand-New Caledonia except for one record of the former in British Columbia. In many regions the stratigraphic sequence of Monotis is too inadequately known for evolutionary sequences to be deduced but some examples of chronologic and geographic subspeciation are pinpointed. The only clearly defined lineage is that within Maorimonotis from maniapotoi through awakinoensis and routhieri to calvata. The genus can be seen to have a high taxonomic diversity and rapid rate of evolution. Apart from three questionable lower Triassic and lower Jurassic species, Monotis is confined to the Norian Stage, and possibly to the Columbianus and Suessi Zones of the mid and upper Norian. Monotis is postulated as having been epibyssate throughout life and normally epiplanktonic on drifting or floating marine vegetation, with coexisting taxa occupying different microenvironments on different parts of the plants. A serious objection to this mode of life is the massive algal production necessary to provide a substrate for the tremendous numbers of individuals involved in Monotis shellbeds. Reduction of the byssal ear in Maorimonotis is seen as a significant event and coupled with the trend to an equivalved condition is interpreted as indicating change to an endobyssate benthic existence for M. routhieri and calvata; this adequately explains the restricted distribution of this subgenus. Detailed stratigraphic analysis of Monotis in Murihiku sequences necessitates rejection of the Rocky Dome section as stratotype for the Warepan Stage on the grounds that although M. richmondiana has been cited as the marker fossil for the stage, past usage has clearly equated the base of the stage with the incoming of the genus, and richmondiana is not the oldest member of the genus to be found in Murihiku sections. Earlier members are absent from the stratotype which therefore must be relocated in order to retain the stage in its accepted scope. The Kiritehere coastal section suffers the disadvantage of penecontemporaneous submarine slumping, but is proposed as stratotype for a new Marakopan Stage because it is the thickest, best exposed, clearest and best known sequence of Monotis beds and adjacent strata in New Zealand. Within this stage a sequence of five formal and three informal chronozones is defined. The lower Marakopan Mokaui and Murihikuensis Chronozones can be grouped together as an Eomonotis chronozone when faunas are too poor for better correlation, and similarly the overlying Acutecostata, Richmondiana and Calvata Chronozones can be grouped as an Entomonotis chronozone. In addition a topmost Marakopan chronozone can be recognised from the absence of Monotis and basal Otapirian indicators and the presence of a fauna which at present seems common to the two stages. Monotis is the most common fossil in the Torlesse Super-group and the lower four Chronozones, and probably also the Calvata Chronozone, are all represented. Most forms present in Murihiku rocks are also present in Torlesse, but two common Torlesse forms are unknown in Murihiku sequences and this is believed to indicate both communication and barriers between the two regions in Marakopan times. Monotis-bearing Torlesse lithologies are more varied than Murihiku and indicate different depositional regimes. Whilst Murihiku Marakopan strata are all of normal clastic lithologies and show a southwards increase in grain-size, the Torlesse picture is more complex. Firstly, an increasingly deeper and offshore situation is suggested by some deposits with Murihiku faunas: inner or middle neritic origin for Monotis-bearing clasts in a (?) late Jurassic conglomerate at Morrinsville which possibly accumulated in the outer neritic zone or slightly deeper, outer neritic for in situ strata near Aria, slightly further offshore accumulation for ? middle Jurassic m&#233;lange in the Oroua Valley and Marakopan slump deposits in the Otaki Gorge, and bathyal or even abyssal deposition for argillites with scattered Monotis in the Mt Arthur-Bealey area. The Aria Monotis beds lie west of the Waipa Fault, yet fit best into Kear's (1967, 1971) Morrinsville Facies, and indicate that the Hakarimata Anticline, Waipa Fault and the facies relations postulated by Kear date from the mid-Jurassic and that there was no feature like the modern continental edge and slope during upper Triassic times in the region. Close paleogeographic relations between these areas and the Murihiku region in Marakopan times is indicated and is not disproven by any sedimentologic evidence yet known. One lithologic association not represented in and showing distinct geographic separation from the Murihiku area is the shell limestone-submarine lava-chert association, which is that containing Monotis species endemic to the Torlesse. This is postulated as having been formed in localised offshore shoal areas (guyots) formed by submarine volcanism; even these regions had some connection with Murihiku seas.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2580</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ocular delivery of antisense oligonucleotides using colloidal Carriers: improving the wound repair after corneal surgery</field><field name="creator">Rupenthal, Ilva Dana</field><field name="description">Background and Aim: Clinical outcomes of refractive surgeries are variable due to individual wound healing responses, but might be improved by effective delivery of anti-inflammatory agents. Knockdown of connexin proteins, using an antisense oligonucleotide (AsON) approach, has been shown to significantly reduce the inflammatory response and increase the rate of wound closure after corneal laser surgery. The challenge remains to find delivery systems that are easy to apply, but can still effectively deliver the AsONs to the target site. This thesis aimed to evaluate the efficacy of several in-situ gelling formulations to deliver Cx43 AsONs to the wounded tissues of a rat corneal scrape wound model. Methods: Formulations were characterised in terms of their rheological behaviour, microstructure and spreading ability. They were then evaluated for their irritation potential, precorneal retention and ability to control the release of the model hydrophilic drug pilocarpine hydrochloride both in vitro and in vivo. The stability of the AsONs in these formulations was assessed using Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer. Finally, formulations containing the stable AsONs were applied to a rat corneal scrape wound model and penetration depth, wound size after 12 hours and cellular dynamics underlying the wound healing response were analysed. Results and Discussion: Systems based on gellan gum, xanthan gum, carrageenan and alginate underwent sol-to-gel phase transition upon addition of the cations present in tear fluid. All tested systems exhibited favourable contact angles and were found to be non-irritant. Systems based on gellan gum, xanthan gum and carrageenan showed the longest ocular retention and exhibited the slowest release characteristics both in vitro and in vivo. AsONs were found to be stable in all formulations apart from the chitosan system, where precipitation occurred. This formulation also exhibited the slowest wound healing rate due to induction of a pro-inflammatory response. Conversely, delivery of the AsONs by gellan gum and carrageenan formulations resulted in significant reduction in wound size, inflammatory response and Cx43 levels. Conclusion: In-situ gelling systems based on gellan gum and carrageenan are able to successfully deliver Cx43 AsONs to the wounded tissues and therefore improve the healing response after corneal surgery.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2606</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis of DFO derivatives and their application to fingermark detection</field><field name="creator">Ramachandran, Sumankalai</field><field name="description">1,8-diazafluoren-9-one (DFO) is one of the most common reagents used to enhance latent fingermarks on porous substrates. However, this compound is slower to react than similar reagents, and also does not always react to completion. This thesis investigated methods to address these problems. The reaction of DFO with fingermarks has been widely studied phenomenologically, but there are few studies focusing on the chemistry of the reaction. Since the accepted mechanism for the reaction of DFO with amino acids shows that DFO reacts in a 2: 1 stoichiometry with primary amino acids, linking two DFO moieties into one molecule could provide the following advantages: First, the two DFO moieties are maintained in close proximity thus increasing the chance that both can react with a single amino acid. Second, fluorescence is dependent on the overall flexibility of the molecule, so a bridged DFO dimer could lead to a more rigid product exhibiting greater fluorescence. Finally, a cyclic product should be less susceptible to hydrolysis. The synthetic route taken to synthesise DFO dimers involved five steps. The first step, synthesis of the mono-N-oxide of DFO, proceeded cleanly and in good yields. The second step involved the introduction of a halogen (chlorine and bromine) at the 2-position of the N-oxide. The 2-chloro DFO was prepared cleanly and in good yields from the N-oxide, while the 2-bromo derivative was prepared from the 2-chloro derivative via 2-amino DFO. After protection of the carbonyl functional group (using acetals) the 2-halo DFO intermediates were reacted with selected diols in basic conditions to form bridged dimers. The final step involved deprotection of the acetal to give the carbonyl functional group. Four bridged DFO dimers were synthesised. Crystal structures supporting two of these compounds were obtained, while most of the intermediate compounds in the synthetic route were characterised by NMR and mass spectrometry. Reaction of alanine with the dimer synthesised with a 2,2'-dimethyl-propane-1,3-diol bridge leads to a colour change similar to that seen with DFO. This suggests that the bridged analogues do react with amino acids and can therefore potentially be used as alternatives to DFO. Characterisation of the product with L-alanine was difficult as mass spectrometry indicated that it was polymeric. Attempted reactions at low concentrations of both the dimer and the amino acid did not lead to the formation of the desired cyclic product and in most instances, no reaction occurred. Attempts at metal ion templating also were unsuccessful, possibly since metal ions can catalyse hydrolysis of the product and intermediates during the reaction with amino acids. The products obtained from the reaction of L-alanine with a series of 2-substituted monomeric DFO compounds had similar absorbance and fluorescence spectra to the unsubstituted product, although they showed decreased fluorescence intensity in solution. Studies on porous substrates also indicated that none of the derivatives showed higher fluorescence than DFO upon reaction with fingermarks. However, the halo- derivatives appeared less susceptible to hydrolysis. The imine of DFO is stable in ethanol: acetic acid and reacts about 10 times more rapidly with L-alanine than does DFO at 60 oC and 78 oC, suggesting that the imine might allow development of fingermarks at lower temperature than required for DFO. However, when a fingermark on paper was treated with DFO and DFO imine, the DFO imine treated fingermark did not show significantly more colour or fluorescence than that with DFO treatment.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2610</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multi-scale effects on deformation mechanisms of polymer nanocomposites : experimental characterisation and numerical study</field><field name="creator">Dong, Yu, 1977-</field><field name="description">In order to make much stiffer, light weight and high performance material products, polymer nanocomposites play an emerging role in the material innovation. Unlike other thermoplastics, polymer nanocomposites are fabricated by introducing a small amount of solid nano-scale fillers (normally less than 5 wt%) such as nanoclay, carbon nanotubes or nanofibres into a plastic resin to dramatically enhance its stiffness, strength and thermal properties. The difference between nanocomposites and conventional fibre composites is that the added fillers are extremely small, only one-millionth of a millimetre thick, and provide a much larger interface area per unit volume for greatly improving the interfacial bonding effect between nanofillers and the polymer matrix.      More importantly, polypropylene (PP)/clay nanocomposites have quite a high potential to form such innovative materials and replace the conventional plastics in many automotive and packaging applications. Nevertheless, the growth of PP/clay nanocomposites faces an obstacle of hydrophobic polymer&#8217;s low interactions with hydrophilic clay. Maleic anhydride (MA) grafted PP (MAPP), commonly used as a compatibiliser, has been proven to facilitate a good clay dispersion within the PP matrix through its functionalised MA groups. But despite the great attention from the manufacturers and researchers in recent years,commercial PP/clay nanocomposites with reliable material properties are still limited in availability. The major problem stems from the complex influences of the material selection and processing methods.      The present work developed a comprehensive approach from the material formulation and processing, experimental characterisation to the numerical modelling of PP/clay nanocomposites based on the finite element analysis (FEA) of micro/nanostructures. Initially, effects of the material selection including the clay type and content, MAPP content and PP matrix viscosity were investigated for the mechanical property enhancement of PP/clay nanocomposites. These nanocomposites were prepared using twin screw extrusion and injection moulding processes with a well-known Taguchi design of experiments (DoE) method in order to statistically detect the significant factors for influencing their mechanical properties. The preferred material formulations were then determined by Pareto analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the technical and economic considerations. The fundamental material characterisation was also conducted on those formulated nanocomposites using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). Overall mechanical properties of neat PP and corresponding nanocomposites were determined by the general tensile, flexural and impact tests. Finally, computational models were established by implementing both the representative volume element (RVE) technique and innovative object-oriented finite element (OOF) analysis to predict the tensile moduli of PP/clay nanocomposites in comparison to the experimental data and available composites theoretical models.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nanotechnology</field><field name="subject">Computer Simulation</field><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="subject">Material Science</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2642</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Narrative identity: Ricoeur and early childhood education</field><field name="creator">Farquhar, Sandy</field><field name="description">The thesis argues that who we are, what we aspire to, and how we enact social and cultural practices are a result of the way we narrate stories about ourselves as both individuals and members of communities. The question &#8216;Who am I?&#8217; is frequently answered with reference to what is important to us: our commitments and what we determine as good, valuable and right. Our identity is thus inextricably woven into our understanding of life as an unfolding story, bound by an ethical commitment to what we value. In this way, understandings of narrative and identity become part of the social and cultural context of education, drawing upon complex relationships between individual and community. It is through narrative that we construct truth about ourselves in relation to others. The central concern of the thesis is the interplay between the &#8216;capable&#8217; child subject and various readings of texts that form the educational landscape in Aotearoa New Zealand: in curriculum documents with their emphasis on relationships, reciprocity, community, culture and language; and in policy documents with their emphasis on economic rationality. The thesis examines some important narratives that emerge from readings of these curriculum and policy documents, and the impact of those narratives on identity formation in early childhood education. Examined in turn are a liberal narrative, an economic narrative and a social narrative. Each of these narratives emphasises particular discourses and rationalities within education. The thesis finds these narratives inadequate to explain understandings of the self of early childhood education. The thesis argues that Ricoeur&#8217;s hermeneutical approach enables a range of narrative possibilities for early childhood education. The use of Ricoeur&#8217;s narrative theory in the thesis is twofold: a methodological approach for the study, and a critical exploration of the formation of &#8216;narrative identity&#8217; (for both the individual and the group) through an examination of selected narratives. The thesis responds to the tensions of these narratives through Ricoeur&#8217;s understandings of &#8216;intersubjectivity&#8217; and &#8216;just institutions&#8217; and provides educators with an ethical framework by promoting Ricoeur&#8217;s understandings of the &#8216;good life&#8217; and a &#8216;capable subject&#8217;.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ricoeur</field><field name="subject">Early Childhood Education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2625</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analogues of Natural Product-like Scaffolds: Synthesis of Spiroacetal Derivatives</field><field name="creator">Choi, Ka Wai</field><field name="description">Diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS) involves the synthesis of several synthetic targets by transforming a collection of structurally simple and similar starting materials into a collection of structurally more complex and diverse products.

It is the causative agent of many life-threatening disease states, including sepsis, staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing pneumonia. S. aureus is associated with 1% of all hospital stays and estimated costs of US$9.5 billion / year (for 2000 and 2001) in the USA alone (Noskin et al., 2005). Recently, a novel family of virulence factors produced by S. aureus was identified, which share sequence and structural homology to the infamous superantigens (Arcus et al., 2002; Williams et al., 2000) &#8211; proteins that cause a range of symptoms, including food poisoning and toxic shock. This family of staphylococcal superantigen-like proteins (SSLs) includes 14 members, of which 11 (SSLs 1-11) are closely linked within a mobile genetic element, called a pathogenicity island (Kuroda et al., 2001). To date, the literature suggests that the SSLs exhibit important host immune-evasion functions that are distinct from the superantigens. SSL5 has been reported to inhibit leukocyte rolling, a key process in their recruitment to sites of infection (Bestebroer et al., 2006). SSL7 inhibits serum-mediated killing of bacteria (Langley et al., 2005). This thesis describes the investigation into the structure and function of the related protein, SSL11. The binding specificity of SSL11 has been identified as the trisaccharide Neu5Ac&#945;2-3Gal&#946;1- 4GlcNAc, where Neu5Ac is essential for interaction, whereas the NAc sidechain of GlcNAc is not, but is highly favoured. The interaction between the related carbohydrate, sialyl Lewis X (sLex, or Neu5Ac&#945;2-3Gal&#946;1-4[Fuc&#945;1-3]GlcNAc), and SSL11 has been characterised at an atomic level by X-ray crystallography. The dissociation constant of SSL11 binding to sLex was determined by surface plasmon resonance to be in the micromolar to sub-micromolar range. Investigation into the effects of SSL11 on neutrophils reveals that nanomolar concentrations of SSL11 inhibited neutrophil rolling on a P-selectin surface in vitro. Additionally, SSL11 was rapidly internalized, exhibited a cytoplasmic distribution and caused changes in actin, visible by 2-D gel analysis. The characterization of the interaction between SSL11 and the previously-identified ligand, Fc&#945;RI (the myeloid immunoglobulin A receptor), is also described. The dissociation constant - II - of SSL11 binding to Fc&#945;RI was determined by surface plasmon resonance to be in the micromolar to sub-micromolar range and was found to be sialic acid-dependent. Binding of SSL11 to Fc&#945;RI inhibited the binding of its native ligand, IgA. The sialic acid-dependent glycan-binding site of SSL11 is the sole site of interaction with the neutrophil surface, shown by neuraminidase treatment of cells and complete abrogation of binding by a site-directed functional knockout mutant. Residues involved in glycan binding were found to be conserved in SSLs 2-6, giving rise to a potential related function between this subset of the SSL family.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2613</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In the character of Shakespeare: canon, authorship and attribution in eighteenth-century England</field><field name="creator">King, Edmund (Edmund George Coghill)</field><field name="description">At various points between 1709 and 1821, Shakespeare&#8217;s scholarly editors called into question the authenticity - either in whole or in part - of at least seventeen of the plays attributed to him in the First Folio. Enabled largely by Alexander Pope&#8217;s attack, in his 1723&#8211;25 edition of Shakespeare, on the Folio&#8217;s compilers, eighteenth-century textual critics constructed a canon based upon their own critical senses, rather than the &#8216;authority of copies&#8217;. They also discussed the genuineness of works that had been excluded from the 1623 Folio - Pericles, The Two Noble Kinsmen, Edward III, the Sonnets, and the poems published in The Passionate Pilgrim. Although these debates had little effect on the contents of the variorum edition - by 1821, only Pericles, the Sonnets, and the narrative poems had been added to the canon&#63719;arguments and counter-arguments about the authenticity of Shakespeare&#8217;s works continued to abound in the notes. These would, in turn, influence the opinions of new generations of critics throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In this thesis, I return to these earlier canonical judgements, not in order to resuscitate them, but to ask what they reveal about eighteenth-century conceptions of authorship, collaboration, and canonicity. Authorship in the period was not understood solely in terms of &#8216;possessive individualism&#8217;. Neither were arguments over Shakespeare&#8217;s style wholly contingent upon new discourses of literary property that had developed in the wake of copyright law. Instead, I argue, the discourse of personal style that editors applied to Shakespeare emerged out of a pre-existing classical-humanist scholarly tradition. Other commentators adopted the newly fashionable language of connoisseurship to determine where Shakespeare&#8217;s authorial presence lay. Another group of scholars turned to contemporary stage manuscript practices to ascertain where, and why, the words of other speakers might have entered his plays. If, however, Shakespeare&#8217;s plays were only partly his, this implied that Shakespeare had written alongside other writers. In the last part of my thesis, I examine the efforts of eighteenth-century critics to understand the social contexts of early modern dramatic authorship. Pope represented the theatre as an engine of social corruption, whose influence had debased Shakespeare&#8217;s standards of art and language. Other eighteenth-century commentators, however, had a more positive understanding of the social aspects of authorship. Drawing on contemporary discourses of friendship and sociability, they imagined the Elizabethan stage as a friendship-based authorial credit network, where playwrights collaborated with their contemporaries in the expectation of a return on their own works. This language of sociable co-authorship in turn influenced the way in which Shakespearean collaboration was understood. Conceptions of Shakespearean authorship and canonicity in the period, I conclude, were - like authorship in the Shakespeare canon itself - not singular, but manifold and multivocal.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2615</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Laser scanning in vivo confocal microscopy of corneal microstructure in inherited and acquired corneal disease</field><field name="creator">Niederer, Rachael Louise</field><field name="description">Purpose The cornea requires maintenance of clarity, shape, thickness and surface cellular integrity to retain normal vision. In vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) enables microstructural analysis of the in vivo cornea, allowing fresh insight into corneal microstructure in health and in inherited and acquired corneal disease. Recently, the introduction of laser scanning IVCM has utilised point scanning with coherent light to push forward the boundaries of real-time in vivo imaging. This related series of studies aimed first to validate the role of laser scanning IVCM and then to utilise laser scanning IVCM to examine corneal microstructure in normal subjects, following penetrating keratoplasty and in corneal ectasia and corneal dystrophy. Methods Subjects were assessed with slit lamp examination, corneal topography and laser scanning IVCM. Basal epithelial, sub-basal nerve plexus, keratocyte and endothelial cell and innervation density were quantified. Results Laser scanning IVCM generated high quality images of corneal microstructure. Comparison with slit scanning confocal microscopy illustrated good correlation between the two microscopes, although differences existed between optical section thickness and image contrast. High repeatability and inter-session and inter-observer reproducibility was demonstrated with laser scanning IVCM. The subsequent studies examined corneal microstructure alterations with age, following penetrating keratoplasty, and in corneal ectasia and corneal dystrophy. Laser scanning IVCM highlighted alterations at every level of the cornea and good agreement was observed between the in vivo and ex vivo results following penetrating keratoplasty. Conclusions In vivo confocal microscopy allows rapid analysis of corneal microstructure in health and disease, offering clinicians and researchers an exciting bridge between clinical and laboratory observations.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2608</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface composition of industrial spray-dried dairy powders and its formation mechanisms</field><field name="creator">Kim, Esther Hee-Jung</field><field name="description">Spray-dried dairy powders are common ingredients in many food and dairy products. Some of the properties of these powders that are important in their storage, handling and final application are expected to be determined by the surface composition of the powder. Therefore, an understanding of the mechanism behind the formation of the surface composition of the powder and the ability to control the surface composition will be very useful in the improvement of product quality and the development of new products. The aim of this thesis was to understand the mechanism behind the formation of the surface composition of industrial spray-dried dairy powders. To achieve this, a comprehensive research on the surface composition of industrial spray-dried dairy powders was undertaken, using electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA, also known as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)). This involved the investigation of the effects of the composition of the concentrate before drying, manufacturing processes, processing conditions and storage on the surface composition of the powder. The distribution of milk components (including triglycerides in milk fat) within the powder particles was also investigated to obtain further insight in the processes occurring within the particles during powder production. It was found that the surface composition of industrial spray-dried dairy powders (skim milk powder, whole milk powder, cream powder and whey protein concentrate) is significantly different from the bulk composition. Particularly pronounced was the accumulation of fat on the powder surface, deteriorating several powder properties (flowability, wettability and oxidative stability). The fat content of the powder appeared to be the critical factor in determining the surface composition of the powder. Results showed that there is redistribution of components within the particles during the spray-drying process. A kind of solid/solute segregation seems to occur. Fat and proteins are preferentially accumulated near the surface of the particles whereas lactose in the interior of the particles. It was also observed that there is some fractionation among the different milk fat present in the powders, with the accumulating of high melting triglycerides in the free-fat and even more at the surface of the powders. The redistribution of components was found to be affected to a large extent by the spray-drying conditions employed (feed solids content, drying temperatures and degree of homogenization). The subsequent fluidized bed drying and handling processes appeared to have little effect on the surface composition of the powders. However, during long-term storage, there was a release of encapsulated low-melting triglycerides towards the surface of powder, thereby lowering the melting points of the surface free-fat and the inner free-fat. Based on the findings in this work and theoretical considerations, possible mechanisms behind the formation of the surface composition of industrial spray-dried dairy powders, from powder production, through storage, to its final application, were suggested.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2913</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cytotrophoblast differentiation in the first trimester of human pregnancy</field><field name="creator">James, Joanna</field><field name="description">In the first trimester of human pregnancy specialised placental cells, termed cytotrophoblasts differentiate into extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs), which grow out from the placenta and invade into the maternal decidua, acting to physically attach the placenta to the decidua, and adapt the uterine spiral arteries to support pregnancy. A proportion of these EVTs also temporarily occlude the spiral arteries for approximately the first 10 weeks of gestation, preventing maternal blood flow to the placenta and creating a low oxygen environment in which placental and fetal development occur. The processes of trophoblast outgrowth and invasion, and the establishment of a low oxygen environment, are essential for the success of pregnancy, and inadequate trophoblast invasion into the uterus has been associated with recurrent miscarriage, pre-eclampsia and fetal growth restriction. However, the exact mechanisms that control the differentiation of cytotrophoblasts down the extravillous trophoblast lineage are poorly understood. Since the extent of this invasive process is unique to human implantation, animal models are of limited value in studying trophoblast invasion. Existing in vitro models have major limitations in that many are very difficult to quantify while others many not study the correct trophoblast population. The research in this thesis has focussed on the development of novel models by which to study cytotrophoblast differentiation, and the use of these models to further understand cytotrophoblast differentiation down the EVT lineage, and the regulation of EVT outgrowth by oxygen. Methods Outgrowth from first trimester villous explants was characterized using immunohistochemistry. Explant viability was investigated using dual staining with chloromethylfluorescin diacetate (CMFDA) and ethidium bromide, by examining DNA laddering, and by immunostaining sectioned explants over 96 hours of culture. The extended viability of cytotrophoblasts in multilayered cell islands in villous tips was exploited to isolate these cells using sequential trypsin digests of cultured villous explants. The trophoblast population obtained were characterized by immunohistochemistry. Finally, villous explants were cultured in either 1.5% or 8% oxygen and the frequency and area of outgrowths was quantified in order to determine the effect of gestation and oxygen on EVT outgrowth. Results Approximately 1/4 of explants cultured in 20% oxygen produced EVT outgrowth. Outgrowth formation and expansion resulted from proliferation of cells in the tips of anchoring villi, and EVTs within the outgrowth did not proliferate. The percentage of explants producing outgrowth declined as gestation increased from 8 to 12 weeks. Dual staining with CMFDA and ethidium bromide revealed degeneration of the syncytiotrophoblast by non-apoptotic mechanisms within 4 hours of culture, but this syncytiotrophoblast layer was able to be regenerated. The majority of cytotrophoblasts died within one week of culture, but despite this explants were able to produce EVT outgrowth for up to 3 weeks due to the extended survival of a specific set of cytotrophoblasts located in cell islands in the tips of anchoring villi. These surviving cells were able to differentiate into EVTs, but not regenerate the surrounding syncytiotrophoblast in the villus tip. Trypsinization of first trimester villi after extended explant culture resulted in the isolation of a viable population of &#8216;putative EVT progenitors&#8217; that did not syncytialise in culture, but were able to proliferate. 20% of these cells differentiated down the EVT lineage within 96 hours of culture. The putative EVT progenitors expressed markers previously localised to cytotrophoblasts in cell islands of anchoring villi, including &#945;v&#946;6 integrin and FGFR-2. The addition of exogenous FGF-4 did not affect the differentiation of these cells into EVTs, nor did FGF-4 alter the frequency of EVT outgrowth from explants. Culture in 1.5% oxygen significantly reduced the frequency and area of outgrowths in comparison to 8% oxygen. HLA-G and &#945;1 integrin were both expressed throughout outgrowths with no difference in expression of these proteins between oxygen concentrations. Gestation influenced the response of explants to oxygen, with a significant differential response to oxygen concentration in placentae under 11 weeks of gestation but no differential response in placentae of 11 or 12 weeks. Conclusions In the first trimester, oxygen and gestational age regulate extravillous trophoblast outgrowth in both an independent and interdependent manner. The cytotrophoblast population in the first trimester does not consist of one homogenous bipotent population. Rather there are at least two separate populations: 1) EVT progenitors that exist in the tips of potential anchoring villi that are likely to be committed to EVT differentiation and 2) monolayer villous cytotrophoblasts which are likely to be committed to syncytiotrophoblast differentiation. The second population is easily isolated by traditional enzymatic digestion methods whereas the first much smaller population can be isolated by exploiting their prolonged survival in explant culture.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321014 Obstetrics and gynaecology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2607</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic and demographic investigation of population structure and social system in four delphinid species</field><field name="creator">Oremus, Marc</field><field name="description">Population structure, genetic diversity and social system were investigated in four species of dolphins, thought to present contrasting habitat preferences and social organisation: spinner dolphins, rough-toothed dolphins, long-finned and short-finned pilot whales. To overcome methodological limitations, I combined molecular markers (mitochondrial DNA, -or mtDNA-, and microsatellite loci) and observational data (photo-identification and mass strandings) where possible. Genetic samples were obtained from skin biopsies of free-ranging (n = 243) and stranded (n = 375) dolphins.  As with many species of delphinids, spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) form communities in which social and reproductive boundaries are poorly understood. In French Polynesia, capture-recapture analyses based on photographs of distinctly marked individuals (DMIs) and microsatellite genotypes (12 loci) indicated a community of about 150 dolphins around Moorea that is relatively closed on a generational time scale. Distinct communities, likely to follow a similar demographic pattern, were observed around neighbouring islands (Tahiti, Raiatea, Huahine and Bora Bora), as indicated by photo-identification data and restricted gene flow (FST = 0.143, n = 154). Surprisingly high levels of insular mtDNA genetic diversity (average pi = 1.44%, suggesting Nef ~ 100,000) contrasted with demographic characteristics of these communities. There was no evidence for a recent bottleneck effect, suggesting that this pattern is the result of metapopulation structure, based on numerous insular communities connected through male and female gene flow. Investigation of the worldwide mtDNA diversity and phylogeography of long-finned and short-finned pilot whale species revealed a complex evolutionary history (Globicephala melas, n = 434; and G. macrorhynchus, n = 134, including published and unpublished sequences). Strong genetic differentiation between long-finned pilot whales from the North Atlantic (G. m. melas) and Southern Hemisphere (G. m. edwardii) indicated severely restricted gene flow, although shared haplotypes suggested some recent contact between the two subspecies. Low genetic distances among haplotypes and a star-like phylogeny suggested a recent worldwide expansion for this species. Higher levels of diversity (although low compared to other cetaceans) were found in short-finned pilot whales, in particular among samples from around Japan. Phylogeographic studies suggested that Japanese samples originate from three distinct populations, one of which could be the ancestral population of the species. Overall, my results confirmed that worldwide mtDNA diversity is low in the two species, probably due to a recent worldwide population expansion and, potentially, to a matrilineal social structure.  The molecular ecology of the mass strandings of long-finned pilot whales around New Zealand was investigated to test the hypothesis that individuals stranding together are part of an extended matrilineal group. Analyses of mtDNA sequences indicate that more than one haplotype was found in five of the seven mass strandings investigated (n = 275), demonstrating that groups are sometimes composed of unrelated maternal lineages. This was further supported by analyses of relatedness within and between strandings based on microsatellites (14 loci). These analyses discount kinship as the only factor causing large mass strandings in long-finned pilot whales. Parentage analyses confirmed some aspects of previous studies in the North Atlantic, suggesting a social system with at least some level of male and female philopatry to the maternal group, and infrequent paternities within the group. In a detailed study of a large mass stranding (Stewart Island 2003, n = 122), there was no correlation between position of the whales on the beach and genetic relatedness (based on 20 microsatellite loci), discounting the assumption that kinship bonds are maintained during these traumatic events. This was further supported by the striking separation of stranded mothers and dependant calves. This disruption of kinship bonds could help explain the behavioural distress of stranded individuals and the tendency of many whales to re-strand even after being re-floated.  Finally, a study of rough-toothed dolphins (Steno bredanensis) in the Society Archipelago, French Polynesia, provided new insights in the ecology of this poorly-known species. Although traditionally viewed as a pelagic dolphin, analyses supported a pattern of local communities, in some ways similar to spinner dolphins, with fine-scale population genetic structure (FST = 0.60, p &lt; 0.001 based on mtDNA, n = 65) and local fidelity. These communities also showed a low level of mtDNA haplotype diversity (four unique haplotypes at Moorea compared to 18 for spinner dolphins), suggesting the potential influence of a matrilineal social structure similar to long-finned pilot whales.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dolphin</field><field name="subject">molecular ecology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2621</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seeking the prize of eradication: a social history of tuberculosis in New Zealand from world War Two to the 1970s</field><field name="creator">Dunsford, Deborah, 1953-</field><field name="description">Between World War Two and the 1970s, the danger of TB disappeared for most New Zealanders. Conducted against a background of rising living standards, the anti-TB campaign saw dramatic declines in TB mortality and incidence. But tuberculosis proved far more opportunistic than expected. Its continued entrenchment at low levels among New Zealand&#8217;s poor frustrated the campaign&#8217;s ultimate goal of eradication.In the 1940s, the Health Department&#8217;s total commitment to the anti-TB campaign indicated the danger TB represented across society. The nationwide mass X-ray programme reflected the confidence in technology and medical science of the day. It operated for nearly 30 years but its value was largely symbolic. It was a costly means of identifying cases and a more targeted scheme may well have sufficed. BCG vaccination was introduced as the final block in a wall of anti-TB measures and the mass vaccination of school children sought to protect an entire at-risk age group. The timeframe of the anti-TB campaign witnessed the final years of sanatorium treatment. In spite of the isolation and uncertain outcome, these institutions offered many patients a positive experience, safe from the stigmatising attitudes common in society. The drug revolution allowed treatment at home and a reliable cure that, nevertheless, brought its own problems of compliance.The decline in TB was not shared equally. High Maori TB rates fell, but still lagged European rates and, from the 1960s, a growing Pacific Island immigrant population also challenged the goal of eradication. Attempts to control TB at the border reflected racist attitudes of the time. The Health Department grappled with the ethnic diversity of TB incidence and different cultural attitudes to the disease. Now curable, TB&#8217;s potential for stigmatisation faded, yet also persisted for those high-risk groups exposed to poverty. By the late 1970s, mainstream society was beginning to stigmatise ethnic minorities and immigrants as &#8216;responsible&#8217; for TB.This thesis contributes to the history of tuberculosis and public health in New Zealand and internationally. It reveals the shifting ground beneath a public health campaign, not just in medical developments, but in the diversity of the targeted population. The thesis highlights the need for a dynamic and layered approach to public health that anticipates change and diversity and continually adjusts its activities and messages to meet them.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2932</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel diagnostic technologies for optical communication systems</field><field name="creator">Watts, Regan Trevor</field><field name="description">The objective of this thesis was to develop novel technologies for measuring the physical characteristics of high-speed pulse trains, for use in performance monitoring applications. This thesis describes the development of three separate techniques that perform measurements in either the time domain, frequency domain or the phase space of the optical signal. The first section investigates phase-sensitive pulse measurement techniques. A high- resolution SHG-FROG apparatus was custom-designed to measure 40GHz RZ pulse trains, from which an operational characterisation of a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) was realised. A numerical model of a nonlinear pulse compressor was developed to compress 40GHz RZ pulses from 8.5ps down to 3.4ps. These pulses were time-division multiplexed to 80GHz, and phase-retrievals of the 80GHz pulse trains were measured. A comparison between the techniques of SHG-FROG and linear spectrogram has been undertaken for 10GHz pulse sources, exposing SHG-FROG's weaknesses at this particular repetition rate. The second section investigates a simple, time-averaged, nonlinear detection technique. Two-photon absorption in a GaAs/InGaAs quantum-well laser diode was used to measure the duty cycle (and by extension, the pulse duration) of a range of pulse sources. This technique was further developed to measure the extinction ratio of NRZ pulse trains. Additionally, the pulse duration of a mode-locked laser source was measured using the nonlinear absorption in a 1-m length of As2Se3 Chalcogenide glass fiber. This demonstrates that the nonlinear properties of this glass may well find application in future instrumentation. The third section investigates the development of an ultra-high resolution swept heterodyne spectrometer. This spectrometer was used to spectrally-distinguish repetitive 8-bit NRZ patterns at 2.5Gbit/s. It was also used to measure the chirp parameter of an X-cut LiNbO3 MZM, revealing a chirp parameter of &#945;&#960;/2 &lt; 0.1 across a modulation band- width of 250-2500MHz. Additionally, the distinctive CW spectrum of a DFB laser diode was measured. Analysis of the measured CW spectrum yielded a linewidth enhancement factor of &#945;&#8771; 1.8 and also the relative intensity noise of the DFB laser diode.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Optical Performance Monitoring</field><field name="subject">FROG</field><field name="subject">Linear Spectrogram</field><field name="subject">Two-Photon Absorption</field><field name="subject">Chalcogenide Glass</field><field name="subject">Heterodyne Spectrometer</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2860</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Input-specificity of sensory-induced neural plasticity in humans</field><field name="creator">McNair, Nicolas A.</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to investigate the input-specificity of sensory-induced plasticity in humans. This was achieved by varying the characteristics of sine gratings so that they selectively targeted distinct populations of neurons in the visual cortex. In Experiments 1-3, specificity was investigated with electroencephalography using horizontally- and vertically-oriented sine gratings (Experiment 1) or gratings of differing spatial frequency (Experiments 2 &amp; 3). Increases in the N1b potential were observed only for sine gratings that were the same in orientation or spatial frequency as that used as the tetanus, suggesting that the potentiation is specific to the visual pathways stimulated during the induction of the tetanus. However, the increase in the amplitude of the N1b in Experiment 1 was not maintained when tested again at 50 minutes post-tetanus. This may have been due to depotentiation caused by the temporal frequency of stimulus presentation in the first post-tetanus block. To try to circumvent this potential confound, immediate and maintained (tested 30 minutes post-tetanus) spatial-frequency-specific potentiation were tested separately in Experiments 2 and 3, respectively. Experiment 3 demonstrated that the increased N1b was maintained for up to half an hour post-tetanus. In addition, the findings from Experiment 1, as well as the pattern of results from Experiments 2 and 3, indicate that the potentiation must be occurring in the visual cortex rather than further upstream at the lateral geniculate nucleus. In Experiment 4 functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to more accurately localise where these plastic changes were taking place using sine gratings of differing spatial frequency. A small, focal post-tetanic increase in the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response was observed for the tetanised grating in the right temporo-parieto-occipital junction. For the non-tetanised grating, decreases in BOLD were found in the primary visual cortex and bilaterally in the cuneus and pre-cuneus. These decreases may have been due to inhibitory interconnections between neurons tuned to different spatial frequencies. These data indicate that tetanic sensory stimulation selectively targets and potentiates specific populations of neurons in the visual cortex.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neural Plasticity</field><field name="subject">LTP</field><field name="subject">Visual Cortex</field><field name="subject">Sensory Stimulation</field><field name="subject">Spatial Frequency</field><field name="subject">Orientation</field><field name="subject">EEG</field><field name="subject">fMRI</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380103 Biological psychology (neuropsychology, psychopharmacology, physiological psychology)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3285</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Applications of UV-visible spectral imaging in forensic science</field><field name="creator">Wagner, John Harry</field><field name="description">This study investigated the use of UV-visible spectral imaging for the location and enhancement of substances of forensic interest using targeted approaches based on the spectrum of the substance. Spectral enhancement procedures were developed for blood with and without chemical enhancement, and for latent fingermarks after chemical enhancement. Focus was on substances whose spectrum exhibited a steep change in absorbance or fluorescence over a small wavelength range. Substances with such spectral features were able to be enhanced using arithmetic combinations of two or three spectral images taken at wavelengths near the steep spectral feature. Some enhancement reagents do not react to produce a product with a steep spectral feature suitable for photographic enhancement. In such cases reagents that compliment spectral imaging can be developed. A tridentate ligand for iron(II), BBIDMAPP, which forms a complex with a narrow intense charge-transfer band, was synthesised and was used to visualise muddy shoemarks. UV-visible spectral imaging systems based on a liquid crystal filter or a filter wheel were constructed to facilitate the acquisition of the spectral images and to perform the enhancement operations. A thorough characterisation of the imaging systems determined their limitations and sources of artefacts which could lead to complications in interpreting the enhanced images. The spectral imaging procedure used to visualise blood was incorporated into a near-real-time, hand-held imaging system for the location of blood staining. This prototype imaging system is capable of acquiring two spectral images simultaneously, perform the enhancement procedure, and display the enhanced image within 5 s, which would make it suitable as a non-chemical presumptive screening test for blood at crime scenes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forensic</field><field name="subject">Spectral imaging</field><field name="subject">Blood enhancement</field><field name="subject">fingermarks</field><field name="subject">shoemarks</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2629</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using the common-sense model of self-regulation to explore the factors associated with intentional non-adherence to preventer medication for asthma</field><field name="creator">Main, Jodie Jane</field><field name="description">Daily use of inhaled preventer medication is recommended for most people with asthma. However, research suggests many do not adhere to this regime. The current thesis comprises two research studies utilising the common-sense model of self-regulation as the theoretical basis to explore how people make decisions about inhaled preventer use in asthma. The purpose of Study One was to compare a self-report and an objective measure of adherence to preventer medication for asthma and to examine the illness representations and treatment beliefs associated with these measures. Accordingly, 1,936 U.K. General Practice patients who were using preventer medication for asthma completed a questionnaire assessing illness and medication perceptions and gave consent for information to be obtained from their medical records. Adherence to preventer medication was calculated from the Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS) and an objective measure, the proportion of prescribed medication that the participant collected over the previous year. Results show that nearly nine out of ten participants (88.4%) reported some non-adherence to their preventer medication. The most common form of non-adherence was using preventer inhaler only when feeling breathless. The relationships between participants&#8217; representations of their asthma and their beliefs about their preventer medication and adherence measures were tested using structural equation modelling. Seeing asthma as a condition that was not present when asymptomatic was associated with more non-adherence (&#946;=.22 p&lt;.001) and also with collecting a smaller proportion of prescribed preventer medication over the past year (&#946;=-.15, p&lt;.001). Seeing asthma as an acute condition, as a condition without serious consequences, and as a condition that could not be controlled by treatment were also representations associated with non-adherence. Those who did not see the need for preventer medication at all, or did not see the need for preventer medication when asymptomatic were more likely to be non-adherent. The relationship between illness representations and self-report adherence was mediated by the belief that medication was necessary. Having identified a number of key beliefs that were associated with use of preventer medication in asthma, Study Two explored the way in which these beliefs may be developed through the process of appraisal of the influence of medication use on symptom experience. Using quantitative methods, 77 patients from a New Zealand General Practice completed a questionnaire measuring the reasons for experimenting and stopping medication, illness representations and treatment beliefs. Thirty percent of the sample reported actively experimenting with their medication. These participants were more likely to hold the belief that medication did not help in the absence of symptoms (Mann-Whitney U=343.5, p&lt;.05) and to report trying to avoid thinking about asthma (Mann-Whitney U=330.5, p&lt;.05). Fifty-one of the participants were subsequently interviewed about their experiences with using medication and transcripts of these interviews were subjected to a qualitative analysis. Participants&#8217; responses suggested that the process of appraising whether medication is necessary was influenced by the match between what the participant expects to happen when using the medication and what actually does happen. The process of deciding when medication is necessary is influenced by the threshold at which medication is deemed to be necessary and the speed at which symptoms return if medication is stopped. These findings have implications for the development of interventions to improve adherence to preventer medication for asthma. They suggest that a key component of self-management education is educating patients about the nature of asthma as a chronic condition that is present even in the absence of symptoms. Additionally, they provide evidence that many patients are involved in an active process of appraising the success of their medication. Health professionals should be aware of that this process is likely to be influenced by patients&#8217; expectations of medication, the level of symptoms at which they believe action is required to control asthma and the speed at which symptoms return if medication is discontinued. Future research could take the form of a randomised controlled intervention to assess whether discussion of these factors with patients could improve quality of life for people with asthma.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asthma</field><field name="subject">Adherence</field><field name="subject">Health Psychology</field><field name="subject">Common-Sense Model of Self-Regulation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2630</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparative study of the cultural diplomacy of Canada, New Zealand and India</field><field name="creator">Mark, Simon</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the concept and practice of cultural diplomacy. Cultural diplomacy is carried out by a government to support its foreign policy goals or diplomacy (or both) by using a wide range of cultural manifestations for a variety of purposes. The thesis examines aspects of the cultural diplomacy of Canada, Qu&#233;bec, New Zealand and India in order to investigate how cultural diplomacy presents a national image abroad (potentially as part of a national brand); its role in the protection of cultural sovereignty; and how it advances domestic objectives. The thesis argues that cultural diplomacy, in presenting a national image abroad, frequently emphasises a state&#8217;s modern-ness or its cultural distinctiveness. This raises the question of the link between national image and national brand and highlights the limitations inherent in national branding. For some states, cultural diplomacy plays a role in the protection of cultural sovereignty. Canadian cultural diplomacy supports the international activities of domestic cultural industries and has sought to maintain the right to provide this support within the multilateral free trade framework. Qu&#233;bec&#8217;s cultural diplomacy has sought to protect the province&#8217;s cultural sovereignty from a perceived threat from the Canadian federation. Cultural diplomacy helps advance domestic objectives. The cultural diplomacy of Canada has asserted the right of the federal government to be Canada&#8217;s only diplomatic voice, and to counter Qu&#233;bec&#8217;s claims to sovereignty. Qu&#233;bec&#8217;s cultural diplomacy has asserted the province&#8217;s constitutional rights and distinctiveness within the Canadian federation. In a similar way, the international exhibition Te Maori advanced the interests of Maori in New Zealand. Cultural diplomacy&#8217;s domestic impacts include positive international recognition for a state&#8217;s culture, which contributes to a state&#8217;s sense of being a distinctive national community and to its confidence, economic prosperity and nation-building. The thesis concludes that cultural diplomacy remains a valuable tool of diplomacy and is likely to become more important to governments, particularly to their public diplomacy and as a contributor to soft power, because of cultural diplomacy&#8217;s promulgation of a distinctive national identity, the increasing importance of a cultural aspect in economic interests, and the intrinsic appeal of culture to globalised populations.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science::360102 Comparative government and politics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2943</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Restraint of trade at common law</field><field name="creator">Dempster, Hamish Leslie</field><field name="description">This is a collection of essays about the restraint of trade doctrine as laid down in the courts of the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth. Generally, I will not give an account of the restraint of trade doctrine in the United States of America, for even although each individual state (apart from the civil jurisdictions California and Louisiana) and the federation itself, has a common law system, for reasons peculiar to those jurisdictions, the restraint of trade case law there has become so vast and so confused as to be unsuitable for my purposes. More importantly, however, the common law restraint of trade doctrine in the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth has been laid down by courts without any significant consideration of the state of the law in the United States. Davies v Davies (1887) 36 Ch D 359, 370 by contrast, the period during which the Privy Council operated as a supra national court of final appeal has resulted in considerable harmony in the doctrine within the British Commonwealth. Even now the House of Lords is influential in Australia and Canada and the influence is increasingly reciprocal. By way of an exception I will discuss the purposes of the anti-trust legislation in the United States. This is necessary because I intend to show that the common law restraint of trade doctrine was not able to be, and was never intended to be, a means of regulating the economy in contradistinction to the United States anti-trust legislation and related legislation in the British Commonwealth. This account is not merely a description of the law relating to the restraint of trade doctrine although I do purport to describe the law. There are other accounts of the restraint of trade doctrine which do that well. Accounts of the restraint of trade doctrine include: Matthews &amp; Adler, The Law Relating to Covenants in Restraints of Trade (London, 2nd ed 1907); Sanderson, Restraint of Trade in English law (London, 1926); Heydon, The Restraint of Trade Doctrine (London, 1971); Trebilcock, The Common Law of Restraint of Trade; A Legal and Economic Analysis (Toronto, 1986); Dean, The Law of Trade Secrets (Sydney, 1990); Mehigan &amp; Griffiths, Restraint of Trade and Business Secrets: Law &amp; Practice (London, 2nd ed 1991); Holdsworth, History of English Law IV (3rd ed, 1945) 343-54, 373-9; VIII (2nd ed, 1937) 56-42. There are other, less detailed accounts in contract law textbooks. The purpose of this dissertation is to describe aspects of the doctrine as it developed between the medieval period and the twentieth century and then to use that account as a basis for an analysis of how the law has taken a number of paths during the twentieth century which cannot be justified by the rules and their justifications which existed in the law prior to that time. Such a development has had important consequences for the restraint of trade doctrine and even the law in general, most of which have been detrimental. I do not intend to give a continuous historical narrative covering the whole of the doctrine. The history has been described before. For example, I do not intend to give a discrete account of the process by which the absolute rule against general restraints of trade gave way to the rule of reason, although I do mention this process where relevant for other purposes. The history, so far as it is relevant, is integrated into each chapter. I will argue that historically the restraint of trade doctrine was a rule or complex of rules, of a certain form and content. The form and content of the rule are important because they bear on the meaning of the class term "restraint of trade" which is an element of the rule. The meaning of that term began to change around the year 1890. Beginning first with certain classes of trade combination, courts began to classify as restraints of trade covenants which did not in fact restrain trade. Then the courts similarly treated the exclusive dealing contract and certain forms of property transaction. Another trend in the law which added to the confusion about the meaning of restraint of trade was the failure by the courts to make definitive findings one way or another as to whether a particular covenant was in restraint of trade. The courts were then faced with a dilemma. The law required a court to refuse to enforce a covenant in restraint of trade unless the covenantee could justify the restraint by presenting evidence to the court from which the courts could assess whether or not that particular restraint was within the reason for the restraint of trade doctrine or not. Such considerations were entirely inapt in the case of covenants which, in accordance with the traditional view, did not restrain trade. Yet if the courts did not validate these contracts, catastrophic consequences would have followed for the parties to such contracts and, indeed, to contract as an institution. To solve the dilemma the courts began to interpret the famous statement of the restraint of trade doctrine by Lord Macnaghten in Nordenfelt v Maxim Nordenfelt Guns &amp; Ammunition Co [1894] AC 535, 565 (HL) literally, rather than contextually. Ultimately this has resulted in the obscuring of the rule underlying the restraint of trade doctrine itself. There were many minor confusions along the way. It is important that the doctrine is coherent and its use consistent with its justifications because it is still a fruitful cause of legal change. In the last year the force of the rule has caused a radical restructuring of Association Football in Europe Bosman&#8217;s case. The rule has even penetrated the collective consciousness of the community at large. The broad thrust of the development and the detail will be outlined in the next thirteen chapters.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement::390100 Law</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2675</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trade unions and the common law in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Harrison, Rodney</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to examine and evaluate the present common law relating to trade unions in New Zealand.

These developments have occurred as a result of questions which have been raised, on both sides of the Atlantic, about the role of the juvenile court in combating delinquency. In the United States the resulting re-appraisal of the court&#8217;s function has been characterised by an emphasis on the fact that the court is part of the criminal justice system, and that it therefore cannot ignore the need to protect society against harmful conduct and to observe the requirements of due process. In England and Scotland, on the other hand, the movement has been towards the creation of tribunals which pay less attention to the child&#8217;s offence and which exercise a jurisdiction which tends to blur the distinction between offenders and non-offenders. From an analysis of this contrast the thesis moves to an examination of a significant similarity between the emerging Anglo- American systems. Although different solutions have been adopted to the problem of re-defining the role of the Juvenile court, the reforms in each of the countries studies have been accompanied by a desire to narrow the jurisdiction of the court. The conclusion which emerges from an examination of British and American experience is that, instead of seeing the juvenile court as an all-purpose delinquency-control agency, it should be viewed as an agency whose inherent limitations must be recognised if best use is to be made of its distinctive capabilities. This conclusion raises four related problems which the thesis considers in detail. First, attention is given to the task of attempting to define the court&#8217;s role, and an effort is made to determine which functions it can effectively and appropriately perform. Second, on the basis of this analysis, consideration is given to the formulation of criteria which indicate with precision the types of case which should be referred to court. Third, the design of an effective sieving device is discussed: machinery must be created which will ensure that the court receives only those cases which are appropriate to its re-defined role. Fourth, reference is made to the types of informal services which are required to deal with the cases diverted from the court. Against this comparative and theoretical background aspects of New Zealand&#8217;s system for dealing with young offenders are considered. This part of the study takes the form of an historical analysis of its development and a description of the system in operation. Because of the conclusion reached regarding the importance of limiting court intake particular attention is focused on the procedures and criteria employed in making the decision as to whether or not a child should be prosecuted. Hence the fieldwork on which much of the New Zealand material is based concentrates on the Youth Aid/Social Welfare conference. An attempt is made to describe and analyse the day-to-day working of this type of sieving device. The findings are discussed, and certain features of the conference system are criticised. The thesis concludes with comments on some of the difficulties which must be taken into account in implementing a policy which emphasises the informal handling of young offenders.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2672</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of the common law defences of fair comment and qualified privilege to a defamation action with particular reference to New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Tobin, Rosemary</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement::390100 Law</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2674</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rogernomics and the Treaty of Waitangi: the contradiction between the economic and Treaty policies of the fourth Labour government, 1984-1990, and the role of law in mediating that contradiction in the interests of the colonial capitalist state</field><field name="creator">Kelsey, Jane</field><field name="description">During the 1970s and early 1980s the historic contradiction between Maori and the colonial state publicly resurfaced, with high-profile Maori demands for the recognition of Maori sovereignty. By 1984 those demands became broader-based. They focused on the Crown's affirmation in the Treaty of Waitangi of continued Maori control over economic resources, independent political authority, and the protection of the Maori way of life. In the face of these pressures, the Labour Party, and later the fourth Labour Government, committed itself to a policy of recognising the Treaty of Waitangi. At the same time, New Zealand's under-developed capitalist economy was in crisis. Advocates of market liberalism within the Fourth Labour Government secured a power base from which they launched the New Zealand version of their paradigm, known as Rogernomics. The two policies were logically irreconcilable, and embodied the deeper, real contradiction of the colonial project itself. Once that logical contradiction became apparent, and the electoral implications became too costly, the Treaty policy gave way. The primary focus of this thesis is the role played by colonial law, legal ideology, and the legal intellectuals in mediating those contradictions during the 1980s. They helped to secure a passive revolution, whereby Maori demands were defused, and Maori resistance was subsumed within the political and judicial forums of the colonial state. This development is analysed within the framework of the dual state, whereby metropolitan and colonial social formations co-exist within the one national boundary, both dominated by the capitalist mode of production. In this thesis, that duality comprises Pakeha within New Zealand, and Maori within Aotearoa. The specifically legal dynamics are situated within the complex interactions of the economic, political, juridical, and ideological levels of that dual state during the 1980s. The thesis concludes that the colonial state did secure a passive revolution over Maori between 1984 and 1990. But this was, at best, a temporary reprieve. By the end of the Fourth Labour Government, in October 1990, many Maori remained committed to the anti-colonial struggle. It appeared that the fundamental contradictions of colonial capitalism, and the crisis of constitutional legitimacy for the colonial state, had not been resolved. They had merely been deferred.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement::390100 Law::390110 Indigenous laws</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2871</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Traditionalizing sustainable development: the law, policy and practice in Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Kwa, Eric L. (Eric Lokai)</field><field name="description">In 1987, the World Commission on Environment and Development published its long awaited report: "Our Common Future". The report contained a detailed discussion of global environment and development problems and a set of recommendations which the Commission suggested could alleviate many of those problems. At the core of the Commission's recommendation was the 'sustainable development' concept which the Commission strongly suggested countries should adopt as the principal vehicle for overcoming many of the global environmental and social ills. But, what is sustainable development? What are its core values? How can sustainable development be utilized to arrest and resolve global societal problems? Does sustainable development have a universal application? Under what conditions can sustainable development be successfully implemented? These are some of the key issues that are addressed in this research paper. In this paper I look at the origin and definition of the sustainable development concept and identify the relevant principles of the concept. I also identify the tools that are necessary for the implementation of the concept. The underpinning of my argument is that sustainable development can be successfully implemented by countries particularly developing countries because the concept has strong roots in traditional cultures which are dominant in developing countries. I explore this position and the various issues that have been identified above by adopting Papua New Guinea (PNG) a developing country as a case study.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement::390100 Law</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2873</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An inquiry into the necessity for the harm requirement in criminal offences: an existential study</field><field name="creator">Garrett, Elisabeth Helena</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2869</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vessel source pollution and key international conventions: a case for change</field><field name="creator">Gray, J.A. (John Andrew)</field><field name="description">Pollution from vessels cannot be controlled effectively without the involvement of flag States. They have the primary responsibility for ensuring that the vessels which fly their flags comply with all applicable international rules and standards relating to vessel source pollution. Compliance with such rules and standards involves additional operating costs for ship-owners. Thus, in the highly competitive international maritime transport industry, there are many incentives for flag States not to prejudice their pursuit of comparative advantage by ensuring that their flag vessels comply with the applicable rules and standards. Enforcing their flag vessels to comply is not a rational choice. Accordingly, flag States must be given reasons to ensure that their flag vessels do comply with pollution control rules and standards if the problem of vessel source pollution is to be resolved. Neither of the two international Conventions which regulate the control of vessel source pollution, namely MARPOL and UNCLOS III, gives flag States reasons to ensure the compliant operation of their flag vessels. For that reason, neither Convention can claim to be an effective means for controlling pollution from vessels. There is, however, emerging evidence of flag State commitment to the control of vessel source pollution in response to the application of regional Port State Control measures. From the perspective of flag States, one aspect of the application of the concept of Port State Control is of concern - that is the legal basis of the control measures which are being taken against their flag vessels for violations of MARPOL's rules and standards.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement::390100 Law</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2868</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a microarray for potyvirus detection and identification</field><field name="creator">Wei, Ting, 1968-</field><field name="description">Potyvirus is the largest and one of the most economically important of the virus genera infecting plants. The complexities of potyvirus identification resulting from many different species, mixed infections, emerging new viruses, new hosts, and new vectors, etc., often requires the use of multiple detection methods which is time consumable and costly. Therefore an assay that can test for a range of potyviruses simultaneously, with good specificity and sensitivity, is desirable. This study looked at the feasibility of producing an oligonucleotide microarray for detection and identification of potyviruses at both species and strain level. Thirty plant samples with suspected potyvirus infections were collected from field and research laboratories in New Zealand and partial NIb gene, complete CP gene and 3&#900;UTR were sequenced. Twelve definitive potyviruses, one tentative potyvirus, one non-potyvirus, and one novel potyviruslike sequence were identified, six of which were first records for New Zealand. Sequence analysis showed that NIb and CP genes and the 3&#900;UTR contained both conserved and variable sequences which were used to design both species and strain level specific probes. Four Potyvirus species were chosen for a &#8220;proof of concept&#8221; study and probes were designed using two different software programs (ROSO and CAG software). A total of eighty five probes including 33 perfect-match and 52 mismatch probes were selected to represent the four targeted potyviruses. Each probe was synthesized with spacers of either 6 or 12 poly-cytosine or poly-thymine at the 5&#900; terminus. Arrays showed high specificity to the targets when tested using nineteen different geographically diverse potyvirus isolates representing the four target species, four distinct but closely related New Zealand potyviruses, and four healthy plant species. Factors affecting the hybridization efficiency, e.g. the size of the target fragments, secondary structure of probes and targets, label type, strandedness, Tm and GC content of probes, were also investigated. The approaches and protocols developed in this study should form a useful basis for developing other potyviruses arrays and the results also provide useful insights into issues of generic interest for the development of arrays for detecting other pathogens.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3070</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A cyclical perspective of the common law</field><field name="creator">Cadenhead, John.</field><field name="description">This thesis is an attempt to use synthesis and analysis in respect of certain models of tort obligation to show that the common law has evolved and been shaped by recurring cycles. It was not possible to analyse the entirety of the wide sweep of tort obligation, so the models of trespass, trespass on the case, deceit and special relationship negligence were synthesised and then historically compared. From these models distinct recurring cycles of the common law became apparent, which alternated between expansionary and conservative stages. At one time the common law seeks a vehicle for new flexible remedies and obligations, and at another, it seeks the certainty of fixed rules. The cycle is incessant as for every swing in one direction, at a certain point on the pendulum, there will be a reaction. This thesis explores the pathology of those cycles through such selected models, including the symptoms exhibited by the initial ad hoc characteristics of the birth of a remedy or obligation, the maturing phase of a remedy or obligation created by the emergence of categories of liability, the abstraction from such categories of a general principle, and either the over-extension of such general principle, or the narrowing of such general principle leading to the obligation's ultimate demise as a flexible vehicle of liability. In the event of the death of an obligation or remedy, as a flexible vehicle of liability, the common law will seek to find or create another avenue of flexible remedy. The thesis does not seek to investigate the reasons or causes of such cycles, but is content to examine the symptoms exhibited by the various phases of such cycles. The initial two chapters summarise the general theory of such cyclic perspective and briefly outline the template of such cycles created by the early origins of the common law. The cycles of 'trespass' and 'deceit' show the rise and fall of those respective obligations from flexible remedies to narrow moribund obligations. The concepts upon which they were based of contra pacem and honesty were to prove excessively narrow and restrictive to survive the inevitable attrition caused through the natural accumulation of rules. A study of the cycle of these two obligations is rewarding as they both show a complete lifespan of an obligation through the various phases of a cycle up to the point of its death as an instrument of flexibility. The protean action on the case and the modern pragmatic case-by-case negligence formula, based on the open-ended elements of &#8216;foresight', 'proximity' and 'just and reasonableness', illustrate the problems caused by a remedy or obligation whose conceptualisation is vague and uncertain. The common law itself until 1875, apart from equity, had the ability through the action on the case to provide the common law with flexibility when needed. The closest that the common law in modern times has come to emulating the action on the case has been the remedial use of the negligence mechanism. While the action on the case did not survive the procedural reforms of the 19th century, it had developed general rules that limited the scope of such open-ended action. These general over-arching rules are important to a study of modern negligence liability. This thesis will endeavour to show that the modern open-ended negligence formula should be limited by comparable general rules to resist the inevitable pressure upon it to define its fault component or duty mechanism too narrowly. Synthesis by use of the tool of comparative legal history shows the constant tension in the common law between the quest for certainty through rules, on the one hand, and the ability to administer individual justice, despite the presence of a general rule, on the other. A comparison of the life cycles of the models selected shows a certain symmetry concerning the reasons and justifications advanced in constructing liability in either an expansionary or conservative phase of the common law. A cyclic perspective of the common law treats it as a dynamic constantly moving instrument that reflects the policy moods of contemporary society. Such a view of the law is not one-dimensional and may provide answers as to the past and present evolution of the common law and may give clues as to its future direction.

The combined pressures of endemic social needs and international demands for tighter drug control measures inevitably raise questions as to whether certain criminogenic effects were produced by this legislative activity. They include: Did premature restrictions cause amplification of the range of substances that became the subjects of abuse? Do the restraints that are now imposed have a scope and severity disproportionate to the social harm threatened by the proscribed conduct? These questions cannot be conclusively answered in a study of this nature, but the historical approach illustrates the complex relationship, both on a domestic and an international scale, between legislative action and conduct which is deemed criminal. An attempt is made to evaluate the assistance available to New Zealand courts from overseas judicial interpretations of legislation enacted within the same context of international obligation. As is then demonstrated, the major drug offences provide fertile ground for nurturing the technical requirements of proof of guilt. Already in New Zealand, in response to the demands and resources of accused persons faced with high penalties upon conviction, the concept of possession has been judicially analysed in great depth and detail. A comparative study is made of the requirements of the corresponding possessory offences in some other jurisdictions; each of the major offences against the Act is then analysed by analogy with the elements of possession. The statutory defences are also examined in relation to this analysis. Although an appraisal of the morality of current legislative policy is not seen as being within the scope of this study, an attempt is made to gauge the effect of Parliament's extension of police powers of search and seizure, and of the power to use listening devices, on the ways by which the courts have weighed socially important contending interests in the most delicate of balances. The courts' evident acceptance of the need for 'undercover' police detective operations in relation to drug offences is documented, as are the judicial restraints applied to the use of evidence so obtained. Sentencing policy in this context is a subject of increasing public interest and concern. An analysis is made of the principles of sentencing as they emerge from New Zealand Court of Appeal judgments over the period 1970-1979. It will be shown that aspects of that policy received recognition in the 1975 Act. However, because of the apparent emphasis on deterrence, many problems continue to tax the sentencing tribunal. This study does not purport to be exhaustive. It excludes detailed consideration of the administrative provisions in the Act and eschews analysis of offences against sections 11, 15 and 16 (concerning theft, etc., of controlled drugs, false statements, and obstruction of officers). The discussions of liability for secondary participation, and the inchoate offences, are confined to such points as are seen to be directly related to the context of drug offences. With some exceptions where subsequent information has come to hand, the law is stated on the basis of the materials available to the writer on 1 May 1980.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement::390100 Law</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2865</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Constitution of Fiji</field><field name="creator">Sahu Khan, Muhammad Shamsud-Dean</field><field name="description">The Constitution of Fiji though similar to many others adopted within the Commonwealth since the end of the Second World War departs in many respects from the Constitution of the United Kingdom and that of New Zealand. The Constitution of the United Kingdom is wholly unwritten and that of New Zealand is only partly written as contained in the Constitution Act of 1852. Fiji not only has a written Constitution; the Constitution also incorporates the rules or principles which are accepted as constitutional conventions in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. In this thesis attention has been given to the position of the Governor-General as the representative of the Queen and the powers conferred upon him. The fact that he is a local appointee makes his position even more delicate. The problem is accentuated in that the exercise of some of his powers are made nonjusticiable by the Constitution. It is also suggested in this work that the fact that the Constitution of Fiji has an entirely different basis from that of the United Kingdom or New Zealand renders many of the principles adopted in those countries inapplicable. The notion of parliamentary sovereignty propounded by Dicey and others does not apply. The Constitution, not Parliament, is supreme. Judicial review of legislation is inevitable and the courts are intended as guardians of the Constitution. There are other important differences many of which are the result of the political decisions made on behalf of the three main races in Fiji before the Constitution was drafted. The separate Fijian administration and the powers of the Council of Chiefs are illustrations of these provisions. The fact the indigenous Fijians enjoy a privileged position through the separate Fijian Administration and the Council of Chiefs is discussed. The system of representation in the House of Representatives with a combination of the communal and multiracial electorates provides an unusual, perhaps questionable, experiment towards a solution of the tensions and problems associated with a heterogeneous society. Likewise the fundamental rights provisions have special significance in a multi-racial society like that of Fiji. As a background to the above matters a comprehensive survey of the constitutional history of the country is attempted. The role of the judiciary has been given significant emphasis throughout the thesis as it is felt that the judiciary is linchpin of the Constitution of Fiji. Concluding observations have been offered on ways of making the spirit of the Constitution, as enshrined in the preamble to the Constitution, a reality; and to engender a national outlook amongst the people of all ethnic groups.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement::390100 Law</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2870</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding linear algebra concepts through the embodied, symbolic and formal worlds of mathematical thinking</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Sepideh</field><field name="description">Linear algebra is one of the first advanced mathematics courses that students encounter at university level. The transfer from a primarily procedural or algorithmic school approach to an abstract and formal presentation of concepts through concrete definitions, seems to be creating difficulty for many students who are barely coping with procedural aspects of the subject. This research proposes applying APOS theory, in conjunction with Tall&#8217;s three worlds of embodied, symbolic and formal mathematics, to create a framework in order to examine the learning of a variety of linear algebra concepts by groups of first and second year university students. The aim is to investigate the difficulties in understanding some linear algebra concepts and to propose potential paths for preventing them. As part of this research project several case studies were conducted where groups of first and second year students were exposed to teaching and learning some introductory linear algebra concepts based on the framework and expressed their thinking through their involvements in tests, interviews and concept maps. The results suggest that the students had limited understanding of the concepts, they struggled to recognise the concepts in different registers, and their lack of ability in linking the major concepts became apparent. However, they also revealed that those with more representational diversity had more overall understanding of the concepts. In particular the embodied introduction of the concept proved a valuable adjunct to their thinking. Since difficulties with learning linear algebra by average students are universally acknowledged, it is anticipated that this study may provide suggestions with the potential for widespread positive consequences for learning.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2912</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Basic equality and its applications</field><field name="creator">Smith, Nicholas Mark</field><field name="description">Equality is a prominent value in modern moral, legal and political philosophy. There is, however, much controversy over the meaning of the concept and its moral implications. In this thesis I argue that the recent scepticism expressed by some writers about the prospects of reaching any agreement about what equality means is not well founded. The idea is not an empty one. The difficulty in pinning down its exact meaning and implications for our social ethics is caused by its abstractness, not its vacuity. The moral significance of equality can be expressed in the idea of basic equality &#8211; the requirement that persons are to be treated as equals and accorded equal concern and respect. That idea is morally justifiable and plays an important role in modern moral theory. If we accept that human beings are equal in important respects and that a commitment to basic equality as a moral ideal makes sense because of our shared human condition, then it follows that respect for that value is implicit in each instance of our moral decision making. The abstractness of basic equality means that it cannot serve as a straightforward rule which can be easily applied to disputes about who should or should not receive equal treatment. There is no list of prohibited grounds of differentiation that applies in all circumstances. Thoughtful moral judgments about the denial of basic equality typically demand sophisticated assessments of whether the interests of all affected parties have been taken into account and different sorts of denial of basic equality will require consideration of different factors. Attempts have been made in recent equality law jurisprudence to find a less abstract concept of equality that can inform the interpretation of the law. These are unsuccessful because basic equality cannot be reduced to some simpler, rule like, standard. These understandable attempts to make this area of law more manageable are not good explanations of what is morally important about the idea of equality. Clarity about the meaning and purpose of contemporary discrimination law is not likely to be achieved by further attempts to say what this law is really about. The law is difficult to apply because it is in the same broad terms as the idea of basic equality. The central moral quandaries of recent jurisprudential thought about basic equality concern the appropriateness of different treatment on grounds which can be used to discriminate against people. The difficulties that courts have with these issues are not remarkable because the moral issues are intractable. Issues such as indirect discrimination or the fairness of affirmative action policies require in depth consideration of the interests and concerns of all affected parties and will not be resolved by the application of any simple algorithm based on a less abstract definition of equality. These issues are difficult to resolve, not because we do not know what equality is but because weighing the competing concerns of affected parties while paying attention to other important values is a complex and often difficult task.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement::390100 Law</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2876</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study of the Dicke model: from phase space approach to quantum trajectories</field><field name="creator">de Oliveira, Felipe Dimer</field><field name="description">In this thesis we study the Dicke model outside the rotating wave approximation (RWA), by employing phase space techniques and the quantum trajectory theory.

Monolingual participants, matched for age and handedness, were recruited as controls. The Stroop colour-word task was considered an appropriate tool to test the general hypothesis that bilingualism might influence executive or cognitive control processes. In Study One, a dual-task paradigm was used for assessing the lateralisation of language functions (given the linguistic nature of the Stroop paradigm used here) in the bilinguals (Macedonian-English/M-E). Bilinguals showed a more bilateral hemispheric involvement, for both languages, compared to monolinguals. These findings also provided supporting evidence for the hypothesis of greater right-hemispheric involvement for language in bilinguals. In Study Two, two behavioural Stroop task paradigms (manual and verbal) were used in order to assess the magnitude of the Stroop effect between the groups. Bilinguals (M-E, German-English/G-E) showed a trend of smaller interference scores across both languages compared to monolinguals. In Study Three, manual Stroop task performance with concurrent electroencephalograph (EEG) recording revealed that bilinguals had temporal shifts in the N400 component (of about 30-40 ms) for the interference comparison for both languages compared to monolinguals. Also, relative to monolinguals, M-E bilinguals (for both L1 and L2) and G-E bilinguals (for L2) had fewer electrodes over frontal and central sites with a significant amplitude difference in the interference comparison (i.e., a reduced interference effect). In Study Four, the neural substrates engaged during Stroop task performance were investigated using fMRI. In general, monolinguals showed greater activation in regions such as the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate (regions associated with good executive control). This suggested that relative to bilinguals, monolinguals require more neural resources to accomplish conflict resolution. Taken together, Stroop task performance in late and proficient bilinguals currently living in the L2 environment differed from that of monolinguals across all methods of investigation. It appears that cognitive processing changes at the executive level can be observed as a result of bilingualism. The results also provide some evidence for changes in L1 processing following late L2 acquisition, as similar results across both languages and tasks were observed for the M-E bilinguals. It is also possible that slight modifications to cerebral laterality as a result of the late learning of (and continuous exposure to) a second language could contribute to these differences in executive functioning. The language environment might therefore be a major factor in the lateralisation of language processing and executive functioning in bilinguals. These conclusions, though tentative and require further investigation, have important implications for language and executive processing in general and for theories regarding cognitive flexibility in bilinguals.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bilingualism</field><field name="subject">Stroop</field><field name="subject">fMRI</field><field name="subject">EEG</field><field name="subject">interference</field><field name="subject">language</field><field name="subject">behavioural</field><field name="subject">laterality</field><field name="subject">executive</field><field name="subject">control</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380102 Learning, memory, cognition and language</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3365</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Digital surface curvature</field><field name="creator">Rugis, John</field><field name="description">The theoretical basis for this thesis can be found in the subject of differential geometry where both line and surface curvature is a core feature. We begin with a review of curvature basics, establish notational conventions, and contribute new results (on n-cuts) which are of importance for this thesis. A new scale invariant curvature measure is presented. Even though curvature of continuous smooth lines and surfaces is a well-defined property, when working with digital surfaces, curvature can only be estimated. We review the nature of digitized surfaces and present a number of curvature estimators, one of which (the 3-cut mean estimator) is new. We also develop an estimator for our new scale invariant curvature measure, and apply it to digital surfaces. Surface curvature maps are defined and examples are presented. A number of curvature visualization examples are provided. In practical applications, the noise present in digital surfaces usually precludes the possibility of direct curvature calculation. We address this noise problem with solutions including a new 2.5D filter. Combining techniques, we introduce a data processing pipeline designed to generate surface registration markers which can be used to identify correspondences between multiple surfaces. We present a method (projecting curvature maps) in which high resolution detail is merged with a simplified mesh model for visualization purposes. Finally, we present the results of experiments (using texture projection merging and image processing assisted physical measurement) in which we have identified, characterized, and produced visualizations of selected fine surface detail from a digitization of Michelangelo&#8217;s David statue.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of periconceptional undernutrition and twinning on ovine pregnancy</field><field name="creator">Rumball, Christopher William Henry</field><field name="description">Events around conception such as maternal undernutrition and twinning may have effects on offspring physiology and disease risk in adulthood.  Periconceptional undernutrition alters offspring physiology and adult pathology without affecting birth size, while twinning affects birth size and physiology but with inconsistent effects on adult pathology.  We investigated the effects of these two periconceptional events and their interaction on maternal cardiovascular adaptation to pregnancy and fetal growth, physiology and endocrinology in late gestation in sheep.  Pre and/or postconception undernutrition resulted in increased uterine blood flow in late gestation, but no change in maternal blood volume.  Preconception undernutrition alone resulted in a relatively large placenta with a small, slow-growing fetus in late gestation.  In contrast, postconception undernutrition alone resulted in a fetus with rapid late-gestation growth that was maintained through a maternal fast.  Fetuses of ewes undernourished throughout both periods were similar in growth rate and size to controls.  Maternal fasting also demonstrated that plasma levels of C-type natriuretic peptide are acutely and independently regulated by nutrient supply in mother and fetus. Fetuses of ewes undernourished both pre- and postconception had increased glucose disposal following a glucose challenge.  Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis tests in these fetuses showed decreased pituitary adrenocorticotropin hormone response to direct stimulation but increased adrenal response to decreased cortisol negative feedback. Twin fetuses grew more slowly in late gestation than singletons. Twins also had a smaller insulin response to arginine and a greater insulin response to glucose, but periconceptional undernutrition abolished this difference.  Twins had suppressed baseline hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function and decreased adrenal sensitivity compared to singletons, but increased fetal pituitary adrenocorticotropin hormone response to direct stimulation and decreased cortisol negative feedback. These studies suggest that firstly, fetal size is a poor reflection of fetal growth trajectory, physiology and endocrinology.  Secondly, pre- and postconception undernutrition affect late-gestation fetal growth in different ways, while undernutrition in both periods alters fetal endocrine status in late gestation.  Thirdly, the biology of twin fetal development is fundamentally different from that of singletons, which may explain the inconsistency of the relationship between birth weight and adult disease risk in twins.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">developmental origins of health and disease</field><field name="subject">sheep</field><field name="subject">pregnancy</field><field name="subject">fetal programming</field><field name="subject">nutrition</field><field name="subject">twins</field><field name="subject">hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis</field><field name="subject">glucose-insulin axis</field><field name="subject">fetal growth</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270600 Physiology::270603 Animal physiology-systems</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321206 Preventative medicine</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321205 Nutrition and dietetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3290</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design and evaluation of software obfuscations</field><field name="creator">Majumdar, Anirban</field><field name="description">Software obfuscation is a protection technique for making code unintelligible to automated program comprehension and analysis tools. It works by performing semantic preserving transformations such that the difficulty of automatically extracting the computational logic out of code is increased. Obfuscating transforms in existing literature have been designed with the ambitious goal of being resilient against all possible reverse engineering attacks. Even though some of the constructions are based on intractable computational problems, we do not know, in practice, how to generate hard instances of obfuscated problems such that all forms of program analyses would fail. In this thesis, we address the problem of software protection by developing a weaker notion of obfuscation under which it is not required to guarantee an absolute blackbox security. Using this notion, we develop provably-correct obfuscating transforms using dependencies existing within program structures and indeterminacies in communication characteristics between programs in a distributed computing environment. We  show how several well known static analysis tools can be used for reverse engineering obfuscating transforms that derive resilience from computationally hard problems. In particular, we restrict ourselves to one common and potent static analysis tool, the static slicer, and use it as our attack tool. We show the use of derived software engineering metrics to indicate the degree of success or failure of a slicer attack on a piece of obfuscated code. We address the issue of proving correctness of obfuscating transforms by adapting existing proof techniques for functional program refinement and communicating sequential processes. The results of this thesis could be used for future work in two ways: first, future researchers may extend our proposed techniques to design obfuscations using a wider range of dependencies that exist between dynamic program structures. Our restricted attack model using one static analysis tool can also be relaxed and obfuscations capable of withstanding a broader class of static and dynamic analysis attacks could be developed based on the same principles. Secondly, our obfuscatory strength evaluation techniques could guide anti-malware researchers in the development of tools to detect obfuscated strains of polymorphic viruses.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">obfuscation</field><field name="subject">software security</field><field name="subject">program transformation</field><field name="subject">global state monitoring</field><field name="subject">slicing</field><field name="subject">distributed computing</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280300 Computer Software</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3107</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Being aged' in the Everyday: uncovering the meaning through elders' stories</field><field name="creator">Wright-St Clair, Valerie A</field><field name="description">It&#8217;s like the sun and the tide. The aim of this study was to understand the meaning of &#8216;being aged&#8217; through the everyday experiences of those who are aged. Philosophically, this interpretive study was informed by hermeneutics and interpretive phenomenology. The writings of two twentieth-century philosophers, Hans-Georg Gadamer and Martin Heidegger, guided the study&#8217;s design and research methods. The phenomenon of interest is &#8216;being aged;&#8217; a thing which is ordinarily taken-for-granted in the everyday. However, much is already spoken and empirically &#8216;known&#8217; about the phenomenon by those who are not yet aged. Methodologically the study&#8217;s design sought to &#8216;put aside&#8217; those voices and listen in closely to what elders themselves had to say about being in their everyday lives. Individual research conversations were conducted with fifteen participants; four Maori elders aged 71 to 93 and eleven non-Maori elders aged 80 to 97 years. All were living in private residences on Auckland&#8217;s North Shore and recruited by way of the general electoral roll. The conversations were focused on gathering the stories of particular everyday events as well as the person&#8217;s reflections on aging. Anecdotes drawn from the conversations formed the research text. Hermeneutics informed the interpretive engagement with this text. As a non-Maori researcher, cultural integrity of the text and the interpretations was enhanced through partnership with a Maori advisor. Dwelling hermeneutically with the anecdotal text was a way of listening to the spoken and unspoken words. Four overarching notions were illuminated and form the study&#8217;s findings. They are my interpretive descriptions of the ordinary ways of &#8216;being in the everyday,&#8217; the experiences of &#8216;being with others&#8217; in advanced age, the announcing of being aged in the uncomfortableness of &#8216;experiencing the unaccustomed&#8217; and how &#8216;aging just is&#8217; there in an everyday way. Reflecting phenomenologically on the findings, the meaning of being aged is in its ordinariness. My thesis is that being in the ordinary everyday in advanced age both conceals and reveals the phenomenon of being aged.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hermeneutic</field><field name="subject">phenomenology</field><field name="subject">everyday</field><field name="subject">aging</field><field name="subject">elders</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321007 Geriatrics and gerontology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3080</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Engaging reluctant writers: the nature of reluctance to write and the effect of a self-regulation strategy training programme on the engagement and writing performance of reluctant writers in secondary school English</field><field name="creator">Hawthorne, Shaun</field><field name="description">The studies reported in this thesis examine the way engagement and motivational theories provide insight and understanding into how to engage, more effectively, reluctant writers at the secondary school level. Models of &#8216;writing engagement&#8217; and &#8216;reluctance to write&#8217; are proposed which represent a synthesis of findings from literature reviews and from a series of four studies employing a range of quantitative and qualitative methods. Study One investigated the beliefs of experienced teachers of English about the nature of reluctance to write. The teachers were interviewed separately and asked to describe the characteristics of reluctant writers that they had taught displayed. The teachers identified the behaviours and beliefs that they believed these students exhibited and described what they tried to do to improve student engagement with writing. Study Two developed a tool to measure different levels of engagement with writing. A questionnaire was piloted with 99 Year 10 students from four different secondary schools and then further tested and refined with 265 Year 10 students from two secondary schools. The final version of the resulting instrument was later used in the final phase of this project as a means of measuring improvements in reported engagement levels as the result of an intervention. Study Three explored student beliefs about what hindered or aided their engagement with writing in the English classroom. Four focus groups were conducted involving 28 students from the two schools that had participated in the questionnaire study. The focus groups were divided into two types: engaged and reluctant writers. Results from the focus group study clarified the differences and similarities between the two groups of writers and helped to refine understanding of what was important in engaging writers with school based writing. The results suggest that interest in a topic and the perceived relevance of the task to the student are the main factors influencing engagement. Other findings suggest that reluctant writers are more likely to be influenced by teacher, self-belief and knowledge and skill factors than engaged writers who are more likely to want choice and control over their writing. Some gender differences also appeared. In particular, girls appeared to be more aware of the influence of self-belief factors on engagement, and reluctant girls appeared to be particularly influenced by teacher factors. Finally, Study Four was an intervention study exploring the impact a self-regulation strategy development treatment had on the engagement and writing performance of Year 10 students. Students&#8217; ability to self-regulate during the writing process had been identified in each of the previous studies, and in prior research, as an important factor affecting writing engagement and achievement scores. This study specifically sought to measure if the intervention had a differing impact on reluctant versus non-reluctant students. Four treatment groups completed the writing engagement questionnaire before and after the intervention period. Pre and post samples of writing performance were also taken. Findings from this study showed that the reported levels of motivation to engage with writing, of reluctant writers, improved significantly as a result of the treatment and that the treatment had a significantly positive impact on the writing performance of all groups of students. The results from this research suggest that the proposed models of engagement with writing and reluctance to write include important aspects of the two constructs. The study also shows that a self-regulation strategy development intervention set in a regular classroom environment can have positive impacts for all students, and suggests that reluctant writers benefit the most from such interventions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3128</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The nature of the relationship of the Crown in New Zealand with iwi Maori</field><field name="creator">Healy, Susan</field><field name="description">This study investigates the nature of the relationship that the state in New Zealand, the Crown, has established with M&#257;ori as a tribally-based people. Despite the efforts of recent New Zealand Governments to address the history of Crown injustice to M&#257;ori, the relationship of the Crown with Iwi M&#257;ori continues to be fraught with contradictions and tension. It is the argument of the thesis that the tension exists because the Crown has imposed a social, political, and economic order that is inherently contradictory to the social, political, and economic order of the M&#257;ori tribal world. Overriding an order where relationships are negotiated and alliances built between autonomous groups, the Crown constituted itself as a government with single, undivided sovereignty, used its unilateral power to introduce policy and legislation that facilitated the dispossession of wh&#257;nau and hap&#363; of their resources and their authority in the land, and enshrined its own authority and capitalist social relations instead. The thesis is built round a critical reading of five Waitangi Tribunal reports, namely the Muriwhenua Fishing Report, Mangonui Sewerage Report, The Te Roroa Report, Muriwhenua Land Report, and Te Whanau o Waipareira Report.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2930</field></doc><doc><field name="title">S'an&#233;antir ou s'&#233;panouir: avatars d'asc&#233;tisme anorexique dans la litt&#233;rature fran&#231;aise du XIXe au XXIe si&#232;cle</field><field name="creator">Wrigley-Brown, Lynette</field><field name="description">Intrigued by a striking resemblance between certain behaviour, characteristics and preoccupations in characters from French literary texts, on the one hand, and in modern-day anorexics on the other, we have undertaken a study of representations of abnegation.  In reading female ascetic piety, particularly in an extreme and sterile form known as &#8220;scrupulosity,&#8221; as it is seen in Madame Gervaisais, by the Goncourt Brothers, and in the representation of adolescence in L&#8217;Histoire de ma vie, by George Sand, I aim to explore similarities and differences between these two &#8220;conditions.&#8221;  Next, certain texts by Zola, Vincent van Gogh and Simone de Beauvoir allow me to study a wide range of responses to the same questions as those which motivate anorexia nervosa and scrupulosity: questions of balance between the spiritual and the material, of perfectionism, of excessive obedience, of refusal of pleasure, and of a capacity for self-destruction.  Paradoxically, all the &#8220;characters&#8221; studied here (including those &#8220;characters&#8221; created by means of autobiography or letter writing) are represented as possessing tendencies which define these two &#8220;conditions,&#8221; tendencies which are capable of leading either to extraordinary fulfilment, an unheard of creativity, or to self-destruction motivated by a desire for perfect virtue.  Reading these texts in the light of anorexia nervosa allows new insights into them, in turn offering a new perspective on anorexia nervosa, suggesting its long involvement in the cultural history of Europe.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">anorexia</field><field name="subject">scrupulosity</field><field name="subject">scruples</field><field name="subject">asceticism</field><field name="subject">scrupule</field><field name="subject">anorexie</field><field name="subject">Mouret</field><field name="subject">Gervaisais</field><field name="subject">Zaza</field><field name="subject">Sand</field><field name="subject">Goncourt</field><field name="subject">Beauvoir</field><field name="subject">Gogh</field><field name="subject">asc&#233;tisme</field><field name="subject">abnegation</field><field name="subject">Zola</field><field name="subject">abn&#233;gation</field><field name="subject">Histoire de ma vie</field><field name="subject">perfectionism</field><field name="subject">perfectionnisme</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies::420209 French</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::440000 Philosophy and Religion::440200 Religion and Religious Traditions::440207 Religion and society</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3118</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hamlet's transformation: An application of Stanislav Grof's holotropic theory to adolescents who are experiencing grief and loss</field><field name="creator">Bray, Peter</field><field name="description">This thesis extends Stanislav Grof's work on psycho-spiritual transformation by considering whether adolescents can experience what he and Christina Grof (1989, 1990) have called &#8222;spiritual emergency&#8223; (SE). Grof contends that the human psyche, when stimulated by new material originating from loss experiences, may spontaneously reorganise itself. This process either unfolds gently as spiritual emergence or overwhelms the individual as SE. This thesis examines Grof&#8223;s holotropic theory, using Shakespeare&#8223;s Hamlet as an illustration, to establish theoretically how SE might be experienced and observed in an adolescent. Hamlet&#8223;s powerful responses to the death of his father, the loss of his inheritance and the remarriage of his mother are explored via Grof&#8223;s extended cartography of the human psyche and a close analysis of Hamlet&#8223;s soliloquies. As counselling verbatim, the soliloquies provide an important opportunity to discuss how significant experiences of loss have the potential for developmental transformation in adolescence. The possible incidence of SE in adolescence raises questions about how we identify, understand and support young people undergoing this process of transformation. In addition to analysing Hamlet&#8223;s experiences in the light of Grof&#8223;s theoretical framework, the thesis discusses the broader literature on grief and loss and the work of a range of other developmental, spiritual, transpersonal and integral psychologists and philosophers. The thesis engages Grof&#8223;s ideas critically and assesses their relevance for adolescent counselling practice and counsellor education in the New Zealand context. This thesis challenges some widely accepted views among counsellors and educators. It argues for the acknowledgement and identification of the SE experience and recommends that further research be conducted with adolescents. It concludes that an understanding of the deeper dimensions of personal experience can assist professionals to be more effectively engaged with young people throughout their educational journeys.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2931</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Embedded speech recognition systems</field><field name="creator">Cheng, Octavian</field><field name="description">Apart from recognition accuracy, decoding speed and vocabulary size, another point of consideration when developing a practical ASR application is the adaptability of the system. An ASR system is more useful if it can cope with changes that are introduced by users, for example, new words and new grammar rules. In addition, the system can also automatically update the underlying knowledge sources, such as language model probabilities, for better recognition accuracy. Since the knowledge sources need to be adaptable, it is in&#176;exible to statically combine them. It is because on-line modi&#175;cation becomes di&#177;cult once all the knowledge sources have been combined into one static search space. The second objective of the thesis is to develop an algorithm which allows dynamic integration of knowledge sources during decoding. In this approach, each knowledge source is represented by a weighted &#175;nite state transducer (WFST). The knowledge source that is subject to adaptation is factorized from the entire search space. The adapted knowledge source is then combined with the others during decoding. In this thesis, we propose a generalized dynamic WFST composition algorithm, which avoids the creation of non- coaccessible paths, performs weight look-ahead and does not impose any constraints to the topology of the WFSTs. Experimental results on Wall Street Journal (WSJ1) 20k- word trigram task show that our proposed approach has a better word accuracy versus real-time factor characteristics than other dynamic composition approaches.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Speech Recognition</field><field name="subject">Embedded Systems</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3279</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mechanism of anti-tumour activity of the DNA binding agent SN 28049</field><field name="creator">Drummond, Catherine</field><field name="description">SN 28049 is a novel DNA intercalating anti-cancer drug developed at the Auckland Cancer Society Research Centre as part of ongoing research into topoisomerase II poisons with high activity against solid tumours. SN 28049 was curative against murine Colon 38 tumours, a model of colorectal adenocarcinoma which is generally unresponsive to topoisomerase II poisons (1), while two clinically used topoisomerase II poisons, doxorubicin and etoposide, were respectively moderately active and inactive against this tumour. The aim of this thesis was to use human tumour cell lines in order to develop an understanding of the mechanism of anti-tumour activity of SN 28049. Topoisomerase II poisons induce DNA double strand breaks which signal through multiple pathways, and two of these, the &#947;-phosphorylation of histone H2AX (&#947;-H2AX) and the induction of p53 protein were investigated in HCT 116 colorectal carcinoma cells and in NZM3, NZM6 and NZM52 melanoma cells. SN 28049 induced only a small increase in &#947;- H2AX phosphorylation, comparable to that mediated by doxorubicin and etoposide. However, a low concentration of SN 28049 (25 nM) stimulated p53 protein expression in HCT 116 cells to levels in excess of those observed in response to doxorubicin or etoposide. The activation of p53 by SN 28049 cells was investigated using the HCT 116 line and an isogenic line lacking p53 expression. As assessed by expression of the representative p53 transcriptional targets FAS, p21WAF1 and survivin, SN 28049 was considerably more active than doxorubicin or etoposide in stimulating the p53 pathway. However, there was little evidence of SN 28049 inducing either G1 arrest or apoptosis in these cells. SN 28049 instead induced p53-dependent G1 tetraploid arrest following mitotic failure in the absence of cell division. In response to a five-hour drug exposure and further growth in the absence of drug, HCT 116 p53 +/+ cells arrested with a &#8216;4N&#8217; DNA content, expressing high levels of G1-phase cyclin E. At later times, senescence associated &#946;-galactosidase (SA-&#946;-Gal) activity increased, indicative of senescence. Under similar conditions, HCT 116 p53 -/- cells continued cycling with a DNA content of &gt;4N. In contrast, doxorubicin added under similar conditions to HCT 116 p53 +/+ cells caused cycle arrest with an &#8216;8N&#8217; DNA content and signs of senescence, while etoposide induced only signs of senescence. The activity of SN 28049 and a series of its analogues was also compared to that of doxorubicin and etoposide in both the HCT 116 p53 +/+ and p53 -/- lines using growth inhibition assays. When cells were cultured at a density that allows exponential growth, SN 28049 selectively inhibited HCT 116 cells expressing wild-type p53, and the selectivity was related to potency. However, responses to SN28049 were not distinguished qualitatively from doxorubicin and etoposide. In contrast, under conditions of high cell density, SN28049 and several active analogues maintained selectivity for HCT 116 p53 +/+ over p53 -/- cells while doxorubicin and etoposide lost their selectivity. The ability of SN 28049 to activate p53 was retained at high cell density. It is concluded that SN28049 has two cellular actions. The first, shared with doxorubicin and etoposide, is mediated by topoisomerase II-induced DNA damage, is cell cycle non-specific and leads to cell cycle arrest. The second, which is unique to SN28049 and is most easily observed in a cell line (HCT 116) growing at high cell density to ensure minimal expression of active topoisomerase II, involves bypass of mitosis and entry into a G1 tetraploid phase and is characterised by high expression of p53 and its downstream products. It is hypothesised that this second cellular action could explain the high in vivo activity of SN 28049.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3079</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainability in karst resources management: the case of the Gunung Sewu in Java</field><field name="creator">Sunkar, Arzyana</field><field name="description">Although land is abundant, biophysical constraints on Gunung Sewu Karst in Java, Indonesia, limit soil fertility and water availability. Gunung Sewu farmers depend heavily on the land for their survival yet they have a scarcity of the resources needed for productivity. Faced with the need to survive, they have developed cultural, physical and social self-insurance strategies to increase the return from those resources available to minimise the risks to their food security and income. Strategies for land use choices are driven by socio-economic circumstances (social, economical and cultural needs), while strategies for income are driven more by the physical environment. The study confirms that human adaptation strategies are as important as environmental circumstances in determining the consequences of people&#8217;s interaction with the land. The rocky desertification that occurs in the area reflects the unsustainability of current rural practices, although this cannot be blamed entirely on current practices. Historical analysis of Gunung Sewu land use shows that environmental degradation is often triggered by external social factors such as population growth, politics and economic problems as much as, or more than, by the limitations imposed by biophysical factors. Therefore, the sustainability of current resource management in the area cannot be measured by the current extent of land degradation. Instead, there is a need to focus on the causes that underpin the dynamics of a system, not the effects (impacts), i.e. the underlying causes of people&#8217;s motivation and behaviour with respect to resource management must be considered. In effect, sustainability indicators for resource management in Gunung Sewu should be addressed through causal indicators portraying the interactions between people and environment. A system dynamics approach coupled with steps from PICABUE methodology are used to develop sustainability indicators. From a system dynamics perspective, five interacting sub-systems make up the resource management system of Gunung Sewu, i.e. water, demography, food production, economy and culture (where water is treated as exogenous factor). Out of these subsystems, culture is the most influential but the least influenced. The sustainability indicators for the system are soil conservation effort, interest in traditional farming, education level, births, onfarm income, outmigration, rice consumption and crops consumption, each crammed with sensitive parameters, most of which belong to the culture sub-system. This suggests the important of cultural indicators in an evaluation of the resource management sustainability of a resource-poor area.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gunung Sewu Karst</field><field name="subject">sustainability</field><field name="subject">resource management</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">system dynamics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3366</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and Evaluation of Nanoparticulate Drug Delivery Systems for Anticancer Drugs</field><field name="creator">Ganta, Srinivas</field><field name="description">The main aim of this study was to develop nanoparticulate drug delivery systems for chlorambucil (CHL) and asulacrine (ASL). CHL is a DNA alkylating agent. In an attempt to alter the pharmacokinetics (short half-life, rapid clearance and high volume of distribution) and improve the anticancer activity, CHL was incorporated into a lipid nanosphere (LN) formulation. The LN were composed of soybean oil as the internal oil phase, egg lecithin as the primary emulsifier, cholesterol as the phospholipid layer stabilizer, and water as the external phase. PEG-modified (long circulating) and DOTAP-modified (cationic) LN were prepared to evade the reticulo-endothelial system and enhance cellular delivery, respectively. LN prepared by ultra-sonicater and microfluidizer had an average particle size below 200 nm, with a CHL encapsulation efficiency of over 97%. Zeta potential of the LN ranged from -30.6 to +41.5 mV. The LN exhibited good physical stability over six months at 4&#176;C and 25&#176;C. In vitro evaluation on SKOV-3 cells showed that the cytotoxicity and the pro-apoptotic activity of CHL were significantly enhanced when given in the LN formulation compared to the CHL solution (P&lt;0.05). An altered pharmacokinetics with increased plasma AUC and elimination half-life, and reduced clearance were observed after intravenous administration of CHL incorporated LN compared to a CHL solution (P&lt;0.01). A marked reduction in the tissue distribution of CHL was also noted when it was given in LN. In addition, CHL incorporated in LN showed greater anticancer activity compared with the CHL solution in colon-38 tumour-bearing mice (P&lt;0.01). These results suggest that LN could be an effective parenteral carrier for CHL delivery. ASL is an inhibitor of topoisomerase II. In an attempt to improve its efficacy by altering the pharmacokinetic profile, ASL was formulated as a nanocrystal suspension (NS). The NS was consisting of ASL nanoparticles produced by high pressure homogenization and stabilized by stabilizers. The lyophilized NS exhibited good stability over three months at 4&#176;C and 25&#176;C. The dissolution and solubility of ASL were enhanced in NS form compared to un-milled ASL (P&lt;0.05). Initial peak plasma concentration and AUC were remarkably reduced in the plasma after intravenous administration of NS compared to the ASL solution (P&lt; 0.01). This suggests reduced systemic exposure to the drug.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320500 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3081</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Frequency selective wallpaper for mitigating indoor wireless interference</field><field name="creator">Sung, Hui-Hsia</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an effective technique for interference control with the use of frequency selective surfaces (FSSs) in indoor wireless environments. An FSS with a bandstop frequency response was applied to an existing wall as a wallpaper to transform the wall into a frequency- selective (FS) wall. The FS-Wall can be made to deliberately filter out undesired interference, and accordingly improve wireless system performance. In-situ measurements have shown that the FS-Wall prototype can attenuate 5.3GHz{5.8GHz (IEEE802.11a) transmissions by 15dB in addition to the unmodified wall attenuation, whereas other radio services, such as cellular telephony at 1.8GHz, experience only little attenuation. The FS-Wall created performed consistently (with acceptable attenuation levels) with varying signal incident angles from 0&#177; to 56&#177;. The 15dB reduction in signal strength is considered sufficient to isolate a system from external interference, and could potentially improve a WLAN system throughput by 2.2 times. The FSS performance has been examined intensely by both equivalent circuit modelling and practical measurements. Factors that influence FSS performance such as the FSS element dimensions, element conductivities, dielectric substrates adjacent to the FSS, and signal incident angles were investigated. By keeping the elements small and densely packed, a largely angle- insensitive FSS was developed as a promising prototype for FS-wallpaper. Such an FS-wallpaper can be applied directly to the wall (with no intervening spacing) with insignificant mutual interaction between the FSS and the wall. Accordingly, the resultant FS-Wall can be modelled by cascading the effects of the FS-wallpaper and the wall. Good agreement between the modelled and the measured results was observed, which suggests that the equivalent circuit model can be used confidently to assist FSS design. Fabrication techniques and practical installation issues associated with the development of FSS for indoor wireless applications were also investigated in this thesis. With the use of an angle-insensitive bandstop FSS, this research has demonstrated a feasible solution for mitigating external interference into indoor wireless systems. This research work has linked the fields of antenna design, communication systems and building architecture.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3071</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vulnerability of Indigenous Forests in Changing Landscapes</field><field name="creator">Aleksa, Adriana Irene</field><field name="description">Indigenous forests all over the world are suffering habitat alteration, loss of original extensions, and increase of isolation levels, affecting their existence and sustainability. In New Zealand about 70% of the original forest cover has been destroyed since human settlement, converting them to a rare and threatened resource. Part of the problem is because native forests are often immersed in a landscape where other land uses are competing for the same space. Effective conservation management of these indigenous forest remnants requires information about their vulnerability to threats, in space and time. Few studies provide an integrated assessment of the extent to which socio- economic effects are responsible for native vegetation vulnerability and how these relationships change through time. In this study socio-economic drivers at different scales are related to land cover changes. To analyse vulnerability of indigenous forests a temporal dataset was developed from aerial photography for the years 1942, 1961, 1984, and satellite images for the years 1999 and 2006. They were managed within a GIS, recording the extent and distribution of these forests and other principal land covers in a study area of ca. 80,000 ha in the Northland region. Information about incentives to land production and to conservation was compared to changes of composition, configuration and conversion of land cover. Spatial conditioners of change, such as elevation, land use capability and land legal protection, were also assessed as possible constrainers of indigenous forest loss. Results showed that the incentives to land production had changed their significance for vulnerability of indigenous forests through time. These became conditioned by other land covers and incentives to conservation, and besides, indigenous forest was a quite stable cover where the physical characteristics of their location were unsuitable for land production. I concluded that at scale of decades, changes in area of indigenous forest were reversible; non- linear; driven by political, institutional and economic changes but that, biophysical characteristics of the landscape can preclude conversion. Such conclusions may help to set priorities for the long term protection and management of indigenous forests.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300600 Forestry Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3370</field></doc><doc><field name="title">More than wives?: a study of four Church Missionary Society wives in nineteenth century New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ross, Catherine R.</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3075</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Green Prescription physical activity intervention: a cluster randomised controlled trial in primary health care</field><field name="creator">Elley, Carolyn Raina</field><field name="description">This thesis assesses the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the 'Green Prescription' physical activity intervention amongst less-active adults in primary care, using the Auckland Heart Study (AHS) questionnaire to assess change in activity. The validity of two physical-activity questionnaires, the AHS and the GSS questionnaires, was assessed initially, comparing their performance with 7-day activity diaries and pedometers amongst less-active adults in primary care. A cluster randomised controlled trial was then conducted in the waikato region of New Zealand, with 42 general practices randomised to give the Green Prescription or 'usual care'. A systematic screening process identified less-active 40-79 year-old patients. Main outcome measures included change in physical activity, quality of life (SF-36), coronary risk, and blood pressure, over a twelve-month period. Costs of the programme and offset costs of primary and secondary health care utilisation, productivity, and exercising, were collected prospectively for cost-effectiveness analysis from a societal perspective. The AHS questionnaire was found to have adequate reliability and validity, and to be the most appropriate measurement tool for use in primary care research. In the Green Prescription trial, 74% of general practitioners (n=117) and 66% of screened eligible patients (n=878) participated. Follow-up rate, at one year, was 85% (n=750). Mean total energy expenditure increased by 9.4 kcal/kg/week (p=0.001) and leisure exercise by 2.7.kcal/kg/week (p=0.02) or 34 minutes/week more in the intervention group than the control group (p=0.04). The proportion of the intervention group undertaking 21/2 hours/week of leisure exercise increased by 9.72% (p=0.003) more than in the control group (NNT=10.3). SF-36 measures of 'general health', 'role-physical', 'vitality', and &#8216;bodily pain' improved significantly more in the intervention group (p&lt;0.05), as a result of the Green Prescription intervention. There was a trend towards decreasing blood Pressure, no increase in adverse events, and no statistically significant difference in four-year risk of coronary heart disease. The cost of delivering the Green prescription was $170.45 per participant from a funder's perspective and $37.16 (95%CI:-$945.21,$1019.53) from a societal perspective. To increase leisure-time exercise by one hour per week cost $25.36 per month from a programme funder's perspective and $5.47 (95%CI:-$138.90,$149.84)per month from a societal perspective. The AHS questionnaire was considered reliable and valid. The Green Prescription intervention is effective in increasing physical activity and improving quality of life over 12 months without evidence of adverse effects. The intervention is more cost-effective than other physical activity interventions reported in the literature and may be cost-saving in terms of long-term health gains.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3095</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The molecular pathology of the hyper immunoglobulin M syndrome</field><field name="creator">Ameratunga, Rohan</field><field name="description">The Hyper Immunoglobulin M syndrome (HIM) is a rare primary immune deficiency disorder characterised by an inability to produce immunoglobulin isotypes other than IgM and IgD. The B cell-surface antigen CD40, and its conjugate T cell counter-structure, CD40 ligand (CD154), mediate immunoglobulin isotype switching to IgE and IgG4 in the presence of cytokines such as interleukin 4. Patients with the X-linked form of the hyper IgM syndrome (XHIM) have mutations in the CD40 ligand gene which is the molecular basis for impaired immunoglobulin isotype switching in XHIM. This thesis is a tale of two HIM patients, one with XHIM (patient H1) and the other (patient M1) with a novel immune defect which has yet to be fully characterised. Analysis of Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) products of the CD40 ligand gene from patient H1 revealed two mutant transcripts, one missing exon 4 and the other missing both exons 3 and 4. In addition, the cells of patient H1 also produce small quantities of wild type cD40 ligand transcripts. Molecular analysis has shown that this complex splicing defect is precipitated by a point mutation at the invariant 3&#8217; splice acceptor site with a g&#8594;c substitution at position -1 (tcacGTA) of intron 3. RT-PCR studies have shown that the cells of the mother of patient H1 produce both wild type and deleted CD40 ligand transcripts, consistent with her carrier state. Genomic sequencing of intron 3 has shown that she is heterozygous for the point mutation (tcacgEGTA), confirming her carrier status. Analysis of other family members, including the sister and the maternal grandmother, has indicated that they have not inherited the mutation. Patients with XHIM are predisposed to Pneumocystis carinii pneumonitis and to Cryptosporidiosis. Studies of T cell function in patient H1 has identified a defect in antigenspecific proliferation which provides an explanation for the susceptibility of XHIM patients to opportunistic infections. In contrast to patient H1, the cells of patient M1 have wild type CD40 ligand sequence and express normal amounts of cell surface CD40 ligand indicating that he does not have XHIM. Flow cytometry and in vitro antibody synthesis studies have shown that the B cells of this patient are able to undergo immunoglobulin isotype switching both in vivo and in vitro. Unlike the mild T cell defect shown in XHIM patients, a severe T cell defect is present in this patient who also has impaired CD40-induced B cell function. The impaired CD40 function may be secondary to the T cell defect. The demonstration of wild type CD40 ligand transcripts in the patient with a splicing defect may explain the milder phenotype seen in some XHIM patients. The identification of the T cell defect should result in re-classification of XHIM as a combined immune deficiency disorder The characterisation of patient M1 extends the phenotypic spectrum of the hyper IgM syndrome to include a severe T cell defect in the context of normal CD40 ligand structure and function.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3088</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationships between reductive metabolism, DNA damage and antitumour activity of the hypoxia-activated prodrug PR-104 in preclinical models</field><field name="creator">Singleton, Rachelle</field><field name="description">Hypoxia is a characteristic of solid tumours and a potentially important therapeutic target. PR-104, a prodrug designed to target hypoxic cells, is currently in phase II clinical trial. PR- 104 is converted systemically to the alcohol PR-104A which is reduced selectively under hypoxia to its hydroxylamine and amine metabolites. This thesis aims to determine the mechanism(s) of cytotoxicity of PR-104 in preclinical tumour models. Specific objectives were to identify biomarkers of response to PR-104, and to ascertain which features of tumours determine their sensitivity to PR-104 monotherapy. PR-104A demonstrated hypoxia-selective cytotoxicity for all nine human tumour cell lines investigated in culture, but with widely differing hypoxic/oxic differentials because of large differences in aerobic cytotoxicity. Hypoxic cytotoxicity correlated with DNA interstrand crosslink (ICL) frequency (measured using the alkaline comet assay), suggesting ICL are invariably responsible for hypoxic cytotoxicity. There was a similar relationship between ICL and aerobic cytotoxicity, except for four lines with very low rates of aerobic PR-104A reduction. Nonetheless, monotherapy activity of PR-104 in tumour xenografts of all nine cell lines showed a strong correlation with ICL at 24 hours (r2 = 0.733, p&lt;0.001) indicating that DNA crosslinking is the dominant mechanism of cytotoxicity in the pharmacologically relevant dose range. A hypoxia-selective increase in the DNA double strand break marker &#947;H2AX was also observed in all cell lines after PR-104A in vitro, with kinetics and cell cycle distribution consistent with DNA replication arrest at ICL. This marker also correlated with cytotoxicity in tumours (r2 = 0.465, p&lt;0.001). The wide variation in &#947;H2AX levels between cell lines at equivalent cytotoxicity suggested &#947;H2AX is less useful than ICL as an absolute biomarker, but has possible utility for comparing response of aerobic and hypoxic cells within the same tumour. Reduced PR-104A metabolites in tumours also correlated with cytotoxicity (r2 = 0.585, p&lt;0.05), but less well than for ICL. Unexpectedly, the results suggest that rates of intratumour activation of PR-104A are not primarily determined by hypoxia (measured using pimonidazole binding) or expression of the major hypoxic reductase cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase, and that aerobic nitroreduction is a major contributor to its monotherapy antitumour activity.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hypoxia</field><field name="subject">DNA damage</field><field name="subject">biomarkers</field><field name="subject">bioreductive agents</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3286</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The metabolism of steroids by human mammary tissues</field><field name="creator">Couch, Ronald Alexander Fyfe</field><field name="description">Human mammary tissue was incubated in vitro with [7-3H] dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHA-sulphate) and in agreement with other investigators this steroid conjugate was metabolized to DHA and other steroid products.

(Margaret Jane)</field><field name="description">Transplacental glucose transport is vital to fetal growth. Although the presence of glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1) and GLUT3 has been demonstrated in mammalian placenta, the factors regulating these genes remain unclear. Therefore, the overall aim of these studies was to clone ovine GLUT1 (oGLUT1) and oGLUT3 cDNAs, and to use these to investigate gene expression during ovine placental development and function. Ovine GLUT1 (~2.2 kb) and oGLUT3 (483 bp) cDNAs were isolated and cloned. Sequence analysis demonstrated that oGLUT1 showed high homology (97 - 99%) with other mammalian species, whereas oGLUT3 did not (84 - 88%). Northern analysis demonstrated that oGLUT1 mRNA abundance increased from d 45 to d 120 of gestation, then decreased towards term (d 145 &#177; 2), whereas oGLUT3 mRNA abundance increased throughout gestation. Western analysis showed oGLUT1 protein levels increased during late gestation, indicating post-transcriptional regulation of oGLUT1. Localisation experiments revealed spatio-temporal differences in ovine placental GLUT expression. In early gestation (d 45), oGLUT1 protein was restricted to fetal trophoblast cells. By mid gestation oGLUT1 immuno-signal was predominantly localised to maternal villous and endometrial tissue. By late gestation oGLUT1 mRNA was most strongly localised to maternal syncytiotrophoblast and villous tissue, whereas oGLUT3 was predominantly localised to fetal trophoblast cells. Placental oGLUT expression was regulated differently by acute (3 - 8 h) versus long-term (&gt;6 d) alterations in late gestation maternal glucose supply. No evidence was found for regulation of placental oGLUT gene expression by long-term maternal undernutrition, but oGLUT1 and oGLUT3 mRNA and oGLUT1 protein were elevated by short-term (24 - 48 h) maternal hypoglycemia. Acute maternal hyperglycemia transiently increased oGLUT1 and oGLUT3 mRNA abundance, whereas oGLUT1 protein (but not mRNA) levels increased after long-term maternal hyperglycemia. Infusion studies provided no conclusive evidence for regulation of placental oGLUTs by long-term administration of growth hormone (GH) or insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) to the late gestation fetus. Following acute (4 h) fetal IGF-1 infusion, placental oGLUT3 mRNA abundance was greater in growth restricted (placental embolisation) than in normal fetuses, although the reason for this difference remained equivocal. This thesis describes isolation, cloning and sequence analysis of oGLUT1 and oGLUT3 cDNAs. These studies confirmed the presence of GLUTI and GLUT3 mRNA in ovine placenta, and demonstrated ontogenetic and nutritional regulation of placental oGLUT1 and oGLUT3. In addition, these results indicated that regulation of placental oGLUTs may occur at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3090</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Binding capacity of albumin and renal disease</field><field name="creator">Dromgoole, Sydney Herbert</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1973</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3091</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene expression in presympathetic neurons of the rostral ventrolateral medulla of the rat</field><field name="creator">Comer, Alison Mary</field><field name="description">The rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVL) contains a population of bulbospinal neurons which are critically involved in the tonic and reflex control of blood pressure. They project to the intermediolateral cell column of the thoracolumbar spinal cord and excite sympathetic preganglionic neurons. The RVL region also contains the C1 adrenergic group of neurons, some of which are also bulbospinal RVL vasomotor neurons. The objective of this study was to investigate RVL neurons at the cellular and molecular level, to gain a better understanding of the properties of this heterogeneous population of neurons. Two main approaches were used to achieve this. The first studied the expression of several genes in RVL micropunches and single acutely dissociated RVL neurons using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The second utilised antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides (aODNs) to reduce expression of two adrenaline-synthesising genes, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) or phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT), in C1 adrenergic neurons in the RVL. Semi-nested RT-PCR analysis of tissue micropunched from the RVL region of adult rats established the expression of mRNA transcripts for glyceraldehydes 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), TH, PNMT, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), noradrenaline transporter (NET), glycine transporter 2 (GLYT2), neuronal glutamate transporter (EAACI) and glial glutamate transporter (GLT). The expression of mRNA for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67) and the gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) transporter (GAT-1) was also detected in rat brainstem. The micropunch technique combined with RT-PCR offers a simple non-radioactive way to identify genes being expressed in the RVL and other medullary regions. Single neurons were acutely dissociated from the RVL of 13 - 2l day old rats, and classified as spinally projecting or non-spinal by the presence or absence of retrogradely-transported fluorescent beads injected into the upper thoracic segments. Dissociated bulbospinal RVL neurons did not exhibit any spontaneous firing, and there was no evidence of any pacemaker-like properties. A fast-activating (spike-like) inward current could be elicited by depolarising voltage steps, and could be abolished by application of tetrodotoxin. Extracellular application of either kainic acid or L-glutamic acid onto RVL cells under voltage-clamp conditions elicited dose-dependent inward currents. Individual neurons were collected by aspiration into a glass micropipette and the cell contents analysed by RT-PCR. Detection of either GAPDH or NSE mRNA was used as the criterion for selecting cells for further analysis, and 80% of the neuron samples tested expressed one of these genes. A subpopulation of spinally-projecting neurons expressed PNMT or TH (50%), indicating that they were catecholaminergic. Bulbospinal RVL neurons were also found to express mRNA for the MR (45% of those tested), the GR (5%), NET (10%), and EAAC1 (58%). GLT, GAD67 and GAT-1 were not expressed in any bulbospinal neurons, but they were detected in 5 - l0% of non-spinal neurons tested. Expression of mRNA for MR, EAAC1 and NET was also observed in subpopulations of PNMT-positive and -negative bulbospinal neurons. Expression of NET protein, assessed by immunohistochemistry, was found to be similar to NET mRNA expression in C1 adrenergic neurons in the RVL. These results indicate that single-cell RT-PCR is a powerful method for elucidating the functional characteristics of a defined neuronal population, and that it is possible to perform whole-cell patch-clamp recording prior to RT-PCR analysis, allowing linkage of the molecular analysis of mRNA expression to the electrophysiological properties of these neurons. The method is very sensitive, enabling low copy-number mRNA transcripts to be detected, and can be used to provide key information about blood-pressure regulation at the molecular and cellular level. The final part of this study used aODNs to attempt to knockdown expression of TH or PNMT in C1 neurons in the RVL. The aODNs were either injected or infused unilaterally into the RVL of adult rats in vivo, and 4 - 14 days later the animals were sacrificed and the expression of TH or PNMT protein assessed using immunohistochemistry. Immunoreactivity for TH was unchanged by injection or infusion of an aODN targeting TH mRNA. Immunoreactivity for PNMT was decreased in 2 out of l0 infusion experiments, but this was achieved using an aODN with one base pair mismatch to the PNMT mRNA sequence, and could not be repeated with aODNs of the correct sequence. This study was the first attempt to target the PNMT gene with aODNs, and although preliminary in nature, it provided some useful information for future studies of this system. Antisense ODN suppression of genes in the RVL may prove to be an interesting future avenue for investigating the functional significance of specific genes being expressed in the RVL region.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3092</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Involvement of zinc in Alzheimer's disease</field><field name="creator">Cuajungco, Math P</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321021 Psychiatry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3093</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The metabolism of cortisol in the human feto-placental unit</field><field name="creator">Dormer, Robyn Alethea</field><field name="description">A method for assaying cortisol and cortisone using chromatography on either Paper or Sephadex LH-20 columns, followed by competitive protein binding, has been applied to umbilical cord and maternal plasma samples.

Further assays employing a radioimmunoassay for cortisol, and competitive protein binding for cortisone have been applied to cord plasma samples of prematurely-delivered fetuses, after treatment of betamethasone to the mother (12 mg/day for one or two days). The mean value of cortisol in samples from fetuses delivered up to 24 hours after treatment was 2.6 &#177; 2.2 &#181;g/100 ml (n = 4) and the mean value of cortisone was 2.2 &#177; 2.2 &#181;g/100 ml (n = 14). For those fetuses delivered over 72 hours after betamethasone treatment, mean levels of cortisol and cortisone were respectively 10.4 &#177; 3.2 &#181;g/100 ml and 9.4 &#177; 3.4 &#181;g/100 ml (n = 3) compared to control values without betamethasone treatment of 8.2 &#177; 3.5 &#181;g/1 0 ml and 9.6 &#177; 3.7 &#181;g/100 ml (n = 3) respectively. Kinetic parameters of the human placental 11&#946;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase system were assessed using a microsomal preparation in 50% glycerol buffer. The Michaelis constant for cortisol was 1.88 x 10-6M, in the presence of NADP, and 0.56 x 10-6M, in the presence of NAD. Vmax values varied with concentration of cofactor, increasing from 0.031 to 0.076 &#181;moles cortisone produced per minute per mg protein with increasing concentration of NADP from 0.036 mM to 1.2 mM. The value of vmax, for an initial concentration of 1.2 mM NAD, was 0.0598. Substrate inhibition was not evident at the level of cortisol employed (up to a cortisol concentration of 1 x 10-4M). Corticosterone, cortisone, progesterone and pregnenolone inhibited enzyme activity. The results of this study suggest that fetal cortisol is produced by the fetal adrenal, and fetal cortisone originates primarily from the conversion of maternal cortisol to cortisone across the placenta, by the action of the 11&#946;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3094</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neural progenitor cells in the Huntington's Disease human brain</field><field name="creator">Curtis, Maurice A</field><field name="description">The recent demonstration of endogenous progenitor cells in the adult mammalian brain raises the exciting possibility that these undifferentiated cells may be able to generate new neurons for cell replacement in diseases such as Huntington's disease (HD). Previous studies have shown that neural stem cells in the rodent brain subependymal layer (SEL), adjacent to the caudate nucleus, proliferate and differentiate into neurons and glial cells but no previous study has characterised the human SEL or shown neurogenesis in the diseased human brain. In this study, histochemical and immunohistochemical techniques were used to demonstrate the regional anatomy and staining characteristics of the normal and HD brain SEL using light and laser scanning confocal microscopy. The results demonstrated that the normal and HD SEL contained migrating neuroblasts, glial cells and precursor cells but there were more of each cell type present in the HD brain, and that the increase in cell numbers correlated with HD neuropathological grade. The normal and HD SEL was stained with a proliferative marker, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), to label dividing cells. The results showed a significant increase in the number of dividing cells in the HD brain that correlated with HD grade and with CAG repeat length. Furthermore, the results showed that neurogenesis had occurred in the SEL as evidenced by co-localisation of PCNA and the neuronal marker &#946;III-tubulin. Also, gliogenesis had occurred in the SEL as evidenced by the co-localisation of PCNA with the glial marker GFAP. These studies also revealed a 2.6 fold increase in the number of new neurons in the HD SEL. PCNA positive cells were distributed throughout the SEL overlying the caudate nucleus but most notably the ventral and central regions of the SEL adjacent to the caudate nucleus contained the highest number of proliferating cells. I examined the SEL for mature cell markers and demonstrated many of the same cell types that are present in the normal striatum. With the exception of neuropeptide Y (NPY) neurons, there was a reduction in the number of mature neurons in the HD SEL. The NPY neurons were more abundant in the HD SEL suggesting they play a role in progenitor cell proliferation. The results in this thesis provide evidence of increased progenitor cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the diseased adult human brain and indicate the regenerative potential of the human brain. These findings may be of major relevance to the development of therapeutic approaches in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3114</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intracellular signalling by arachidonic acid metabolites</field><field name="creator">Berry, Elicia Bee Ean</field><field name="description">In intrauterine tissues, pro-inflammatory cytokines and prostaglandins (PGs) have been identified as key mediators in the maintenance of pregnancy and parturition. The rise in PGD2 detected in the amniotic fluid before labour prompted the research presented in this thesis which describes the effects of 15-deoxy &#916;12,14 -prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), a non-enzymatic metabolite of PGD2, on amnion-derived WISH and JEG3 choriocarcinoma cells as models of the amnion and chorion trophoblasts, respectively.15d-PGJ2 induced apoptosis in both cell lines in a concentration-dependent fashion (2.5-10 &#181;M). Apoptosis was characterised by condensation of chromatin (visualised after Hoechst 33342 staining), appearance of nucleosomal DNA fragmentation upon electrophoresis and flow cytometry analysis, and activation of caspase-3. Apoptotic cell death was inhibited in the presence of serum (0.5% w/v) and albumin, not serumderived growth factors (insulin growth factor (IGF)-1, IGF-2 or epidermal growth factor (EGF), was determined as the key survival factor. Since 15d-PGJ2 is reported to activate peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-&#947;, the activities of PPARs were assessed using JEG3 cells transfected with a PPAR-response element reporter construct (pTK-PPREx3-luc). The PPAR-&#947;-specific ligand, rosiglitazone, induced PPRE mediated activity in a concentration-dependent manner, while the PPAR-&#947;-specific irreversible inhibitor, GW9662, fully inhibited this induction. However, GW9662 only partially inhibited 15d-PGJ2-induced luciferase activity, suggesting that 15d-PGJ2 may also activate either of the other isoforms. The expressions of PPAR-&#945; and -&#948; were identified in amnion, choriodecidua and placental membranes and PPAR-&#948; was significantly increased all tissues with labour. PPAR-&#945; expression was reduced in chorio-decidua, but was significantly higher in placenta with labour. The changes observed with labour suggest that regulation of PPAR expression and function may have a role in the mechanisms that maintain pregnancy or initiate labour. The anti-inflammatory effects of 15d-PGJ2 were also investigated by measuring interleukin (IL)-1&#946;-stimulated prostaglandin and cytokine productions by WISH cells after treatment with 15d-PGJ2 for 3 hours. 15d-PGJ2 exerted differential effects that were dependent upon its concentration. At low nanomolar physiologic concentrations (1-10 nM), 15d-PGJ2 inhibited IL-1&#946;-stimulated PGE2, but not cytokine (IL-6/IL-8) production or cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression. This effect was attenuated by GW9662, by transfection with dominant negative PPAR constructs, and was reproduced by rosiglitazone. At micromolar (1-10 &#181;M) concentrations, 15d-PGJ2 inhibited IL-1&#946;-stimulated COX-2, PGE2 and cytokine productions and these effects were not blocked by GW9662 or mimicked by rosiglitazone. GW501516 (PPAR-&#948; agonist) also inhibited IL-1&#946;-stimulated PGE2 production, but only at high concentrations (1 &#181;M). IL-1&#946;-induced NF-kB DNA binding activity was significantly inhibited by 15d-PGJ2 (10 &#181;M) and GW501516 (1 &#181;M), but increased by rosiglitazone (10 &#181;M). In conclusion, this is the first report of an effect of 15d-PGJ2 at low nanomolar physiologic concentrations and 15d-PGJ2 mediates its actions through PPAR-&#947; (&lt;0.1 &#181;M) and PPAR-&#947;-independent(1-10 &#181;M) pathways, the latter through inhibition of NF-kB and/or activation of PPAR-&#948;.

The aim of work presented in this thesis was to study various T cell responses in mice to one protein of M. leprae, designated the 18 kDa protein. Mice were immunised with recombinant 18 kDa protein and lymph node cells tested later in proliferative T cell assays. The in vitro response was specific for the 18 kDa protein and proliferation dependent on the immunising dose as well as in vitro antigen concentration. The proliferative response required CD4+ T cells, which recognised the antigen in the context of major histocompatibility class II molecules. The T cell response was tested in various recombinant and congenic pairs of mouse strains. BALB/cJ (H-2d), BALB.B (H-2b), B10,BR (H-2k), and B10.M (H-2f) mice were all high responder strains, while the C57BL/10J (H-2b) mouse strain was a low responder. By comparing the genetic characteristics of these high and low responding strains, it was deduced that both H-2 and non-H-2 gene(s) contributed to the magnitude of responsiveness.F1 progeny mice from high and low responder parents responded in a way that showed that high responsiveness was inherited in a dominant manner. Limiting dilution assays indicated that the frequency of cells proliferating in response to the 18 kDa protein correlated with high and low responsiveness of cells from secondary lymphoid tissue. The low frequency of C57BL10/J responding lymphocytes to the 18 kDa protein probably accounted for the reduced in vitro IL-2 production observed in this mouse strain. The T cell response of mice immunised with either the 18 kDa or M. leprae antigens revealed the following. The 18 kDa protein-primed lymph node cells responded to both M. leprae and. M. tuberculosis, suggesting a shared 18 kDa protein T cell epitope by these pathogens. The M. leprae-primed lymph node cells showed no significant response to the 18 kDa protein, but responded similarly to M. leprae and M. tuberculosis antigens. The results were obtained using both bulk cultures and limiting dilution experiments. This indicated that the l8 kDa protein was probably not a dominant antigen in primary murine immune responses against M. leprae. Proliferative T cell epitopes on the 18 kDa protein were examined in several mouse strains. Each mouse strain responded to one dominant region after immunising with 18 kDa protein. The dominant T cell epitope was not identical in all strains. The peptide consisting of residues 106-l25 of the 18 kDa protein was dominant in BALB/cJ and BALB.B mice, whereas the B10.BR mice responded to peptide 31-50 and C57BL/10J mice to peptide 16-35. Lymph node cells primed with individual synthetic peptides and challenged with 18 kDa protein in vitro revealed additional T cell epitopes which were not recognised following immunisation with 18 kDa protein. Cytotoxic T cell epitopes on the l8 kDa molecule were investigated, using an in vitro-priming system. Only one region of the 18 kDa protein elicited cytotoxic T cell responses. This T cell epitope was restricted to mouse strains of H-2b haplotype. The cytotoxic response was a feature of CD8+ T cells and the lysis of target cells depended upon peptide concentration. Cells infected with a recombinant retrovirus carrying the 18 kDa gene were used to prime mice for the induction of cytotoxic T cells in vivo. Cytotoxic T cell responses were detected but none were specific for the 18 kDa protein. Inflammatory T cell responses to the 18 kDa protein were investigated in a number of mouse strains, using a delayed-type hypersensitivity footpad assay. The C57BL/10J mouse strain elicited a similar or even greater response than other strains tested, in contrast to proliferative T cell responses where C57BL/10J was a low responder strain. The number of immunizations influenced the type of immune response elicited in mice. Multiple immunisations with the 18 kDa protein resulted in a reduced delayed-type hypersensitivity response concomitant with the appearance of antigen-specific IgG antibodies. Several 18 kDa-specific T cell lines derived from BALB/cJ, B10.BR, and C57BL/10J mouse strains were generated. T cell lines from the BALB/cJ strain showed characteristics of TH1 and TH0 phenotypes and one line responded to peptide 46-65 of the 18 kDa protein. The B10.BR- and C57BL/10J-derived T cell lines responded to peptide 31-50 and 106-125 respectively and secreted IL-3 upon stimulation, but neither IL-2 nor IL-4 were detected. Various subsets of T cells might play different roles in the immune response against pathogens. The T cell subsets involved in protection might not be identical to those eliciting a strong immunological reaction. T cell responses against intracellular parasites are discussed in relation to factors that govern protective immunity.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3110</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A genetic study of cleft lip and cleft palate: Auckland, 1960-1976</field><field name="creator">Chapman, Cyril James</field><field name="description">A study of cleft lip and cleft palate was carried out in order to determine whether or not any differences in incidence between Europeans and Polynesians were accompanied by differences in recurrence risks, and to test the genetic hypotheses currently favoured as explanations of familial agggregation of these disorders. An incidence study vas undertaken on all live births in the Auckland urban area for the years 1960 to 1976.Family information was obtained from these probands and from other affected persons or their close relatives, by interview at the cleft palate clinic at Middlemore Hospital. The ascertainment probability for cleft 1ip and cleft palate probands was about 95% and was not correlated with any of the demographic characteristics measured on the probands. After correction for ascertainment, the incidence of cleft palate in Maoris was estimated to be 1.867/1000 1lve births. For Europeans the estimate was 0.643/1000. The corresponding figures for cleft lip with or without cleft palate were 0.397/1000 and 1.195/1000. The sex ratio for cleft palate was 0.485 with heterogeneity between the races. For cleft lip the sax ratio was 0.649 overall. There were no secular or seasonal trends in the incidence of facial clefts and no significant effects of maternal age, or paternal age. The mean birth rank for probands with cleft lip with or without cleft palate was higher than expected. For probands with cleft palate, mean birth rank was not significantly elevated. The pattern of additional malformations in these probands was similar to those reported in similar studies from other centres. The recurrence risk for cleft palate was 1.8% overall. Although it was s1ightly higher in polynesian families than in European families, the difference was nowhere near statistical significance. For cleft lip the recurrence risk was 2.6% overall, with the risk being slightly higher in Polynesian families, but again not significantly higher than in European families. Using current analytical techniques, no discrimination was possible between a generalized single autosomal locus model and a multifactoriar threshold model. A consideration of the parameter estimates for both models suggests that the multifactorial threshold model is the more appropriate one to use for the calculation of recurrence risks in complicated family situations. It is concluded that further family studies of this nature would no longer be warranted unless hypotheses can realistically be tested on the samples available. However, incidence studies in special populations will remain important for hypothesis testing. Following on the work using animal models, a study of face shape within and among races in New Zealand may provide clues to the aetiology of facial clefts, particularly isoleted cleft palate. It will be important to follow changes in incidence over time and discover what effects intermarriage and cultural changes might have on the incidence of facial clefts.</field><field name="date">1981</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321207 Indigenous health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3096</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Insulin-like growth factor-1 after hypoxic-ischemic brain injury: effects and modes of action on neuronal survival</field><field name="creator">Guan, Jian</field><field name="description">Insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF)s naturally occur in the central nervous system (CNS) and have an important role in cell proliferation and differentiation during brain development and maturation. IGFs, IGF binding protein (IGFBP)s and their receptors are expressed in damaged brain regions suggesting a role for the IGFs system after brain injury. It is now known that neurons can die some hours, even days after an injury. This programmed death is termed delayed neuronal death (DND). The process of DND might provide a therapeutic window of opportunity for insulin/IGFs to reduce brain damage after an insult. Unilateral hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury was induced using a modified Levine rat model. Intracerebral ventricular (ICV) administration was chosen for the delivery of the peptides. The effects of IGF-1 on neuroprotection were tested when given either before or after the HI insult. The dose response of IGF-1 on neuronal rescue was also determined. The distribution of IGF-1 after HI injury was examined following central administration of 3H-IGF-1. The mode of action of IGF-1 on brain rescue was studied by comparing the treatment effects of IGF-1, IGF-2, des-N-(1-3)IGF-1 (des-IGF-1), insulin, N-terminal tripeptide of IGF-1 (GPE) and (+)-5-Methy1-10,11-dihydro-1H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclo-hepten-5,10-iminemaleare (MK801). IGF-1 reduced cortical infarction and neuronal loss when given after, but not before, an HI insult in a dose dependent manner. HI brain injury enhanced the penetration of IGF-1 into the brain parenchyma after ICV administration possibly via perivascular pathways and white matter tracks. The effective dose of IGF-I did not alter cortical temperature and serum glucose concentration. Insulin did not alter the outcome at an equimolar dose to IGF-1. The treatment effect of des-IGF-1 was only found at a higher dose. IGF-2 counteracted the treatment effects of IGF-1 on neuronal rescue and tissue uptake of 3H-IGF-1. An equimolar dose of GPE showed a similar response to IGF-1. MK801, an N-methy1-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist did not show significant effect in this model. In summary, IGF-1 was neuroprotective after HI brain injury. The effect of IGF-1 on neuronal rescue depends on the dose and time of delivery. The treatment effect of IGF-1 was independent of hypoglycaemia and hypothermia. The results suggest that this effect is mediated via type one IGF receptors. Distinctive treatment effects by des-IGF-1 and IGF-2 suggested a critical role for IGFBPs on neuronal rescue with IGF-1. A secondary mode of IGF-I action on brain rescue could be through the proteolytic production of GPE. In summary, IGF-1 can improve neuronal outcome in vivo suggesting possible clinic application as a therapeutic agent.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3116</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The physiology of circulating insulin-like growth factor binding proteins: studies in the sheep</field><field name="creator">Gallaher, Brian William</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3098</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Respiratory sensation in asthmatic subjects and matched controls</field><field name="creator">Gaeta, Helen</field><field name="description">Asthmatics most "at risk of death" from their asthma are those that have severe asthma with a history of severe life threatening attacks (SLTAs). Some asthmatics are poor perceivers of the severity of their asthma. It is not known whether these two groups form a homogeneous population. The aim of this thesis was to establish whether this was the case by comparing the sensitivity of asthmatics classified as severe with a history of severe life threatening attacks, asthmatics without a history of SLTAs, mild and moderate asthmatics, and matched controls to externally added resistive loads during inspiration. It also aimed to establish whether poor sensitivity to externally added resistive loads during inspiration was associated with diminished amplitude or increased latency of scalp potentials evoked by inspiratory occlusion. Two studies were conducted to meet the first aim. The first study tested the applicability of the equal variance normal-normal model of signal detection theory as a descriptor of subjects' performance when discriminating between different levels of externally added resistive loads during inspiration. Twelve subjects rated their capacity to distinguish between pairs of resistive loads ranging from 2-33cmH2O/L/s presented during a single inspiration. Data were collected for 100, 200 and 300 single breath trials. The results showed that the model fitted the data well; that 200 trials provided performance indices that were sufficiently precise to distinguish between relatively low, average and high levels of sensitivity; and that, for the modality tested, respiratory sensation complied with Weber&#8217;s Law. The second study applied the validated procedure to test the ability of 25 asthmatics classified either as severe, or mild or moderate, and 25 matched controls to distinguish between pairs of external resistive loads ranging from 2-33cmH2O/L/s presented during a single inspiration. Analysis of the data (ANOVA) showed that there were no significant differences in the ability of subjects to distinguish between resistive loads regardless of whether they were severe asthmatics with or without a history of SLTAs, mild or moderate asthmatics, or matched controls. It was concluded that asthmatics with poor sensitivity to the respiratory sensation tested and asthmatics most "at risk of death" from their asthma were not a homogeneous group, but poor sensitivity coupled with severe asthma, and a history of SLTAs most likely increased the risk of death to that patient. Four studies were conducted to meet the second aim. The first three studies were concerned with determining the reproducibilty of the scalp potential evoked by inspiratory occlusion (designated respiratory event related evoked potentials, RREP) and establishing a reliable recording protocol for the RREP that was relatively free of artefact. The results showed that the RREP was relatively stable over time and the best recording sites were cephalic electrode pairs C3-Cz and C4-Cz (10-20 International System). The fourth study examined the relationship between the ability of 25 asthmatic subjects and their matched controls to distinguish between levels of resistive loads added to inspiration and the latencies and amplitudes of the first positive and first negative components of the RREP. Correlation analysis showed that there was no relationship between sensitivity to added resistive loads during inspiration and RREP component parameters. It was concluded that diminution or absence of the early components of the RREP was not indicative of impaired perception of respiratory sensation though some issues regarding the appropriateness of the analysis still require resolution.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320600 Medical Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3100</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Collagen fibres, force and intracellular calcium in rat cardiac trabeculae</field><field name="creator">Hanley, Peter John</field><field name="description">A thin cardiac muscle preparation of rat (ventricular trabeculae) was used in the two studies described in this Thesis. First, I investigated the mechanisms by which volatile anaesthetics decrease cardiac contractility using trabeculae loaded with a fluorescent Ca2+ indicator. Second, I employed confocal laser scanning microscopy to determine the three-dimensional microstructure of perimysial collagen fibres over the range of sarcomere lengths (1.9 - 2.3 &#181;m) in which passive force increases steeply. The volatile anaesthetics halothane (0.23 &#8211; 3 %) and isoflurane (0.48 - 4%) produced dose-dependent decreases in the amplitudes of the intracellular Ca2+ transients and twitch force. They also produced changes in cellular autofluorescence, consistent with an increase in the concentration of the reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine nucleotides and flavoproteins. When the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator signals were corrected for changes in cellular autofluorescence, the volatile anaesthetics did not significantly change diastolic [Ca2+]. In the presence of halothane or isoflurane, restoration of Ca2+ transients to control levels, achieved by elevation of external [Ca2+], did not restore peak force. Moreover, maximal Ca2+-activated force, elicited using ryanodine tetani, was reduced by halothane and isoflurane. Thus, the negative inotropic actions of halothane and isoflurane in cardiac muscle reflect both reduced availability of Ca2+ and decreased responsiveness of the contractile system to Ca2+. Reconstructed three-dimensional images showed that perimysial collagen fibres are wavy (as distinct from coiled) cords which straighten considerably as sarcomere length is increased from ~1.85 &#181;m (near-resting length) to ~2.3 &#181;m. These observations are consistent with the notion that the straightening of these fibres is responsible for limiting cardiac sarcomere length to ~2.3 &#181;m.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320600 Medical Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3102</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the projections of the superior cerebellar peduncle and the rubrothalamic and nigrothalamic projections in the rat, and their relevance to the homologies of the anterior parts of the ventral nucleus of the thalamus in the mammalian brain</field><field name="creator">Faull, Richard Lewis Maxwell</field><field name="description">Since there has been no detailed study of the projections of the superior cerebellar peduncle (S.C.P.) with the most recently developed silver impregnation technique - the Fink-Heimer method - such a study has been carried out in the albino rat following complete unilateral destruction of the S.C.P. In order to assist with the interpretation of the thalamic terminations of the S.C.P., studies have also been made of the thalamic projections of the red nucleus and substantia nigra. The results are based on experiments in 56 animals: 22 for the investigation of the Projections of the S.C.P., 12 for the investigation of the rubrothalamic projections, and 22 for the investigation of the nigrothalamic projections. Oblique electrode approaches were devised which enabled the placement of discrete peduncular, rubral or nigral lesions with only the minimum of incidental damage to the surrounding Structures. The rubrothalamic projections were studied by the method of successive degeneration. The animals were generally killed after a survival period of 5 to 7 days and the axon degeneration was demonstrated with the Fink-Heimer silver impregnation technique. To analyse and record the experimental results, the patterns of degeneration were identified with the light microscope and meticulously plotted on diagrams of the brain using a projection system. To gain the fullest possible picture of the fibre projections, experimental material was analysed in coronal, sagittal and horizontal planes. The principal results of this investigation in the rat are as follows: (i) The confirmation of Ramon y Cajal&#8217;s (1903) original description that the fibres in the S.C.P. project caudally via ipsilateral and contralateral descending pathways to the pons and medulla and rostrally via a contralateral ascending pathway to the midbrain and diencephalon. (ii) The demonstration: (a) that the ipsilateral descending pathway terminates in the parvocellular reticular formation of the pons and medulla; (b) that the contralateral descending pathway terminates topically in the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis, the pontine nuclei and the inferior olive, and also in the magnocellular nuclei of the reticular formation and the nucleus reticularis paramedianus;(c) that the contralateral ascending pathway terminates mainly in the red nucleus in the midbrain and throughout the Vm-V1 complex of the thalamus, and also in various other midbrain, subthalamic and thalamic nuclei. (iii) The demonstration: (a) that the cells of the red nucleus project to the Vm-Vl complex; (b) that the substantia nigra projects by a dorsal tegmental route to Vm and to adjacent parts of the V1 complex in the thalamus, and that the pars compacta of the substantia nigra projects to the striatum. (iv) The identification of the Vm-V1 complex as the homologue in the rat thalamus of the nuclei ventralis lateralis et anterior thalami of the higher primates on the basis of the distribution of cerebellar, rubral and nigral afferents to these nuclei.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3103</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The potential cancer preventative properties of sweetpotato anthocyanin-rich polyphenolic complex</field><field name="creator">Asadi, Khalid</field><field name="description">Anthocyanins are a widespread source of naturally occurring colorants distributed in fruits, vegetables, and beverages such as red wine.

Reproductive efficiency is a major component of this objective. With the use of cryopreserved semen and artificial insemination, bull fertility is a large factor in herd reproduction. General semen characteristics such as volume, sperm concentration, sperm motility and sperm morphology characteristics are classic methods of assessing fertility. For over 50 years, scientists have attempted to correlate normal sperm morphology with male fertility. Confounding reports as to this correlation may be due to the variability associated with the methods used to determine normal morphology. Due to subjectivity and variability, development of objective and consistent analysis methods receive considerable attention. One subjective method is computer assisted sperm head morphometry analysis (ASMA). Precise and objective sperm head size and shape can be quantified using ASMA. The objectives of this dissertation were to 1) develop processing and analysis methods for the accurate quantification of bull sperm heads, 2) assess the inherent instrument, sample and observer variability associated with the analysis of bull sperm heads and, ultimately, 3) quantify the effects of cryopreservation on bull sperm head size and shape and 4) determine the relationship of sperm-head morphometry and post-thaw fertility of cryopreserved bull semen. A standard semen sample dilution, sperm staining method and microscope magnification level improved the instrument performance in assessing bull sperm head morphometry. There were no significant replication or observer effects detected on sperm head measurements. The heads of bull spermatozoa did show a significant decrease in dimensions after cryopreservation, indicating an effect among all bulls. Furthermore, in a subsequent study, no significant differences between pre-freeze and post-thaw sperm head measurements of two groups of bulls with high and low non-return to oestrus rates were detected. However, the change in sperm head width/length pre-freeze and post-thaw was weakly correlated with the post-thaw fertility among bulls. These results indicate that when standard methods of sample preparation and analysis are used, ASMA is an objective method of analysing bull sperm head dimensions. Measurements provided by the ASMA system show that uniform results are acquired among different observers. A single analysis of one slide, analysing 100 sperm heads, provides precise information regarding the sample. Because sperm head dimensions are affected by cryopreservation, samples of fresh semen will have to be utilised in future studies to determine whether differences in sperm head morphometry are detectable between fertile and subfertile bulls and to quantify the dimensions of spermatozoa of fertile bulls. Furthermore, pre-freeze measurements of morphometry do not appear to be correlated with post-thaw fertility of cryopreserved bull semen, based on non-return to oestrus rates.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3124</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic expression patterns of major lens membrane proteins</field><field name="creator">Grey, Angus Cheverton</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320600 Medical Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3108</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship of structure to function of the superantigen Staphylococcal enterotoxin A</field><field name="creator">Hudson, Keith R</field><field name="description">The relationship of structure to function in the superantigens of Staphylococcus aureus 1 Enterotoxins were isolated from expression in E. coli using the pGeX vector. Yields of up to 20 mg/litre of culture of purified toxin were achieved. 2 Recombinant SEA, SEB, SED and SEE produced by this system were identical to the wild type enterotoxins by several biological and biochemical criteria. 3 The unique T-cell receptor binding site of SEA and SEE was identified by the use of a panel of hybrids between these two toxins. Four different assays showed that the different V&#946; specificity of these toxins was determined by G200, S206 and N207 in SEA and at P206 and D207 in SEE. 4 Residues on both SEA and HLA-DR were identified that directly interact upon binding, thus defining the MHC class II binding site of SEA. The requirement of zinc for SEA binding to HLA-DR allowed the identification of the MHC class II binding site on SEA. This requirement was shown to be due to zinc bridging between these proteins. The zinc binding residues in SEA were demonstrated to be H187, H225 and D227. 5 Histidine 81 in the &#946;-chain of HLA-DR1 was shown to be the fourth residue in the tetravalent coordination of zinc. 6 This investigation in conjunction with the crystal structure of SEB and other mutational studies has collectively identified the T-cell receptor binding site of the enterotoxins. This study also located the MHC class II binding site of SEA and on the crystal structure of SEB the zinc coordinating residues cluster together, well separated from the T-cell receptor binding site. Thus proving that these superantigens cross link the T-cell receptor and MHC class II antigen. 7 The location of the zinc coordinating residues together with the crystal structures of SEB and HLA-DR1 allowed the construction of a structural model of how SEA binds to HLA-DR1. This model predicts that SEA binds across the end of the peptide groove and significantly that the orientation of the T-cell receptor in the recognition of the SEA-MHC class II complex is different to the orientation used to recognise peptide-MHC. This non conventional recognition of superantigen is compatible with the influence of polymorphism in both the T-cell receptor and MHC class II on superantigen recognition.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3120</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of metabolic insult on amino acids in the ciliary epithelium, lens, and retina</field><field name="creator">Hu, Guo Min</field><field name="description">Ischaemic insult deprives ocular tissue of oxygen and essential metabolites leading to anatomical and functional changes. One way to gauge the effect of ocular ischaemia is to determine changes in amino acids likely to be modified due to the intricate interrelationship between cellular metabolism and these compounds. Such an approach, using quantitative silver-intensified immunogold detection of a range of immunoglobulins, can provide a metabolic profile of cells (metabolome). Despite the known alterations in the ciliary epithelium and lens function secondary to ocular ischaemia, little is know about the metabolic profile in both normal ocular tissue and in ocular tissue exposed to metabolic insult. The major goal of this thesis was to investigate the metabolome of the ciliary epithelium and lens under normal and ischaemic conditions, in parallel to that of the retina, with complete spatial and single cell resolution. The results showed that a glutamate/glutamine cycle exists between the ciliary epithelium and lens, in analogy to the metabolic relationship between neurons and glia in the retina. with the localisation of glutamine synthetase and glutamate transporters, amino acids including glutamate and glutamine accumulate in the ciliary epithelium for secretion, so that lens amino acid levels can be sustained. Experimental manipulations reported in this thesis include enzyme inhibition and exposure to acute ischaemia, both leading to fluctuations of the amino acid levels/distributions in the ciliary epithelium and retina, and changes in amino acids associated with cellular metabolism. In the ischaemia/reperfusion experiments, despite recovery of anatomical features, there were persistent metabolic changes in the ciliary epithelium after four days reperfusion, which results in lower amino acids both in the ciliary epithelium and lens. Further, studies of glutamate transporters led to the discovery of a unique mechanism of glutamate release involving the cystine-glutamate transporter at the photoreceptor ribbon complex. In conclusion, the results offer a parsimonious explanation for the common association of altered ciliary body function and cataract secondary to ischaemic insult and provide evidence for highly conserved amino acid metabolic pathways within ocular tissues.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320900 Optometry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3097</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chronic hepatitis B virus infection in Polynesians</field><field name="creator">Abbott, William</field><field name="description">Genetic differences between Polynesians and Europeans may contribute to the many differences in disease frequency that occur between these races. This thesis describes studies that were designed to determine if genetic influences contribute to the high prevalence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Polynesians. Alleles suitable for gene flow measurements were identified and used to find associations between European genes and indices of chronic HBV infection in Polynesians. An ecologic study found a negative association between European genes and the prevalence of chronic HBV infection in five Polynesian ethnic groups (p&lt;0.05). In a case control study, there was a positive correlation (r=0.90, p=0.04) between the percent of European genes in a Polynesian ethnic group and the difference in the percent of European genes between the HBV carriers and the anti-HBs positive controls in that ethnic group. Thus, the possibility that genetic factors are a major cause of the high prevalence of chronic HBV infection in Polynesians cannot be excluded. A twin study or candidate gene studies will be necessary to take this work further. We attempted to identify candidate genes in the Tcr &#946; chain variable region (V &#946;)locus that might contain polymorphisms that influence the human in vivo immune response to the HBV. V&#946;7.4 was associated with the immune response to a vaccine containing recombinant HBsAg in two separate studies (p&lt;0.0001 and p=0.05). The frequency of.V&#946;7.4 was low in the cord blood of neonates born to HBsAg positive mothers (p=0.001). The frequency of V&#946;5.1 was high in the cord blood of neonates of HBeAg positive mothers (p&lt;0.001). Thus the V&#946;7.4 and V&#946;5.1 genes may be preferentially used in the human immune response to the HBV and may be an appropriate place to seek polymorphisms that influence the immune response to the HBV and susceptibility to a chronic HBV infection.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3109</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic chondron function in articular cartilage</field><field name="creator">Hing, Wayne Anthony</field><field name="description">This study examined the behaviour of articular cartilage chondrocytes and the role of the pericellular microenvironment in modifying cellular behaviour during dynamic loading events. While the structural composition and metabolic function of the chondron have been examined previously, little is known about its physiology. Consequently, it was hypothesised that 'the chondrocyte behaves dynamically within the chondron microenvironment, and that the microenvironment plays a critical role in minimising the volume regulatory activity required to maintain the health of the chondrocyte throughout the physicochemical changes associated with the loading cycle.&#8217; Four research objectives addressed the hypothesis. The first was to develop an environmental perfusion chamber and experimental protocols for dynamic imaging of articular chondrocytes in vitro and ex vivo using time-lapse video microscopy. The system developed, which was composed of a chamber and unique complimentary heating system, enabled temperature control, media perfusion and variable delivery of environmental factors, over long imaging periods without fluctuations in focus or loss of cell viability. Secondly was to examine short and long term behaviour of chondrocytes cultured in agarose gel, alginate beads and vibratome prepared explants. The results showed dynamic activity of cytoplasmic organelles, constant changes in position of the chondrocyte within the microenvironment and cellular secretory events that influenced its organisation. Unique information regarding these biological responses will be vital for future research. Thirdly was to examine the role of the microenvironment and its territorial and interterritorial matrices in volume regulation of intact tissue. The microenvironment occupies a critical position between the bulk of the cartilage matrix involved in load bearing deformation and physical changes and the chondrocyte, which attempts to minimise its volume regulatory response while maintaining active metabolic management of the matrices. Fourthly was to examine the role of the microenvironment in volume regulation isolated chondrocytes. Its robust structure appears responsible for physical and chemical protection of the chondrocyte. This study provided the first evidence that the microenvironment can influence the volume regulatory response of the chondrocyte. The composition and integrity of the microenvironment influence the ability of the chondrocyte to respond to osmotic challenge and the intact microenvironment functions efficiently in vivo to minimize the exposure of the chondrocyte to dynamic osmotic challenges that could compromise function.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3121</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the nexus of loneliness, stigma, health complaints, and primary medical care in older New Zealanders</field><field name="creator">Hector-Taylor, Loma Helen</field><field name="description">The nexus or linkages between loneliness, stigma, health complaints, and primary medical care in older New Zealanders was explored from a social constructionist perspective. The intent of the studies was the support and explanation of the underlying arguments of the thesis. For this age group loneliness is a clinical condition which merits greater recognition, diagnosis, and treatment from general practitioners than it presently receives. As a society we silence and stigmatise loneliness in our senior citizens making it likely that they will present indirectly to their doctors when experiencing severe effects of the condition. This behaviour will increase their risk of inappropriate medical intervention at possible cost to themselves and to society. A cross sectional, randomly selected survey of 300 New Zealanders over 60 years old, aimed to establish the patterns of loneliness in the sample using quantitative analysis. The second qualitative study used the methodology of discourse analysis to identify the themes concerning loneliness and medical care in the accounts of older adults, and how these were used. Fourteen people, deemed by their doctors to be lonely and to need frequent medical care, were interviewed in order to further knowledge of the dynamics of loneliness and the medical encounter. Fifteen percent of the sample of 300 had moderate to severe loneliness scores. The sociodemographic indicators of loneliness were extremely easy for a practitioner to recognize. Less than 2% of the total of self reported doctor visits were explicitly for loneliness. According to Barsky's (1981) model, the most likely pathways to the doctor were through symptom amplification and lowered self ratings of health, with a less likely pathway through focusing on and worrying about symptoms, leading to perceived need for medical care. The predictive variances in regressions of loneliness on all health outcomes, except for self reported visiting of more than one doctor for symptoms, were lower for chronic than for situational loneliness. The most important conclusions from the second study were the identification of three rhetorical strategies or "etcetera clauses" which provided a social prescription for the indirect presentation of loneliness by older people. Loneliness may be discussed with the doctor; if it affects your physical health; if you are consulting for another reason; and if the doctor picks it up. Also, the individual doctor defines loneliness as a worthy, or non-worthy, condition for consultation.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321021 Psychiatry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3119</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Child Immunisation: reactions and responses to New Zealand government policy 1920-1990</field><field name="creator">Day, Alison Suzanne</field><field name="description">My thesis has explored the history of child immunisation in New Zealand from a socio-medical perspective. The framework has been hinged around the actions and immunisation strategies of the Health Department over the period 1920 to 1990 and the responses of parents to those actions and strategies. One of the most important concepts considered was how the Health Department decided on and then implemented immunisation policy during the period. Health professionals played a significant role in the delivery of immunisation to children and have impacted on a number of policy changes. After World War Two, with an increase in the number of vaccines on offer, the specialised expertise of the World Health Organization and the Epidemiology Advisory Committee in policy determination became very influential. The responses to departmental immunisation policies by parents demonstrated a significant change during the period, although most apparent in the 1980s. From a situation of wariness (and perhaps indifference) in the 1920s and 1930s to almost total vaccine acceptance from the 1950s, the 1980s were, by contrast, illustrative of parental assertiveness especially concerning side-effects. The advent of feminism in the 1970s and the issues of informed consent in the mid-1980s assisted in raising levels of parental awareness in immunisation which continued into the 1990s. Ethnic and socio-economic background also contributed to different levels of acceptance of immunisation, which will be addressed. Opposition to immunisation tended to wax and wane during this period. Two groups were dominant, although at opposite ends of the time spectrum. Both were small but vocal in their views. Nevertheless, neither group made much impression on New Zealand parents, although they were both an irritant to the Health Department. Overseas experiences in immunisation were interwoven throughout my thesis to set the New Zealand events in an international context. The introduction of a particular vaccine was compared and contrasted with similar schemes elsewhere to give an appreciable understanding of New Zealand&#8217;s position. Vaccine controversies overseas were also examined to determine their influence in New Zealand. Immunisation policy has been shaped by a myriad of factors and influences from both inside and outside the country. There were extensive changes over the years in the way parents, health professionals and the Health Department perceived immunisation which will be examined in my thesis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">immunisation</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3144</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental manipulation of fetal growth</field><field name="creator">Bloomfield, Francis Harry</field><field name="description">The experiments described in this thesis investigated the effects of low doses of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I on fetal growth and metabolism in normally growing and growth-restricted (IUGR) late-gestation ovine fetuses. Intra-amniotic and intravenous routes of administration were studied. The aim of the first experiment was to investigate the effects of daily intra-amniotic injections of IGF-I for l0 days to fetuses with IUGR induced by placental embolisation. Embolisation produced asymmetrical IUGR with moderately severe effects on the gut. Gut weight, gut wall thickness and crypt mitoses were reduced. Villus enterocytes in the ileum contained numerous vacuoles, suggesting either functional adaptation or delayed maturation. IGF-I treatment increased amniotic fluid IGF-I concentrations 5-fold, but decreased plasma concentrations. The effects of embolisation on the gut were reversed, except for the enterocyte vacuolation in the ileum which was more pronounced with IGF-I treatment. Fetal gut uptake of glutamine from the circulation was reduced in IGF-I treated animals, but uptake from amniotic fluid may have increased. Fetal liver and spleen size were reduced. The distribution of placentome types was also altered with IGF-I treatment. The aim of the second experiment was to investigate the clearance of 125I-IGF-I from amniotic fluid. The half-life of 125I-IGF-I in amniotic fluid was 24 hours. Significant amounts of 125I-IGF-I remained unbound for up to 144 hours in both amniotic fluid and plasma. The predominant binding protein in amniotic fluid was IGFBP-3, and the proportion of 125I-IGF-I that was bound in amniotic fluid was strongly correlated with relative levels of IGFBP-3. Uptake of intact 125I-IGF-I across the fetal gut was clearly demonstrated, and continued for at least 36 hours following injection. A preliminary pharmacokinetic model of intra-amniotic dosing with IGF-I is presented. The aim of the final experiment was to investigate the effects of a chronic intravenous infusion of a low dose of IGF-I to normally growing late-gestation fetuses. There were no effects of IGF-I treatment on fetal growth or metabolism. Five fetuses were found to be IUGR at post mortem due to the effects of facial eczema in the ewe. A post hoc analysis of the effects of intravenous IGF-I in IUGR fetuses was therefore performed. IGF-I treatment significantly increased growth rate of IUGR fetuses and increased fetal blood aminonitrogen levels. Mean placentome weight was increased and the distribution of placentome types was altered. IGF-I treatment of IUGR fetuses reduced fetal lactate production. There were no differences in measures of fetal body or organ size at post mortem. The data from these investigations into the experimental manipulation of fetal growth provide clear evidence of the reversal of some of the effects of established IUGR, demonstrate uptake of intact and free IGF-I across the fetal gut, and, for the first time, suggest that IGF-I may increase the rate of fetal growth in IUGR. Amniotic fluid is the most readily accessible fetal compartment. The experiments described in this thesis suggest that fetal supplementation with IGF-I via the amniotic route may be a feasible, efficacious and clinically applicable therapeutic stratagem for the IUGR fetus.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3112</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of proteins in the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland</field><field name="creator">Evans, John Jerram</field><field name="description">Ovine neurophysin was extracted from fresh-frozen whole pituitary glands using hydrochloric acid at pH 1.2-1.6. After salt precipitation neurophysin was separated from other extracted protein by gel-exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G.75. Ion exchange chromatography on CM-sephadex C.50 using acetate buffer in a pH gradient was employed to resolve the neurophysin fraction into three components. Contamination of the preparations by non-neurohypophysial hormones was investigated. Antibodies which were raised in rabbits against ovine and porcine neurophysin were observed to have reactivity with neurophysins of the same and different species as the source of the antigen. Soluble proteins in the neural lobes of a number of mammals were separated by electrophoresis on starch-gel and tested, by immunodiffusion, for immunological reactivity with an anti-porcine neurophysin-II serum. A number of proteins, sometimes more than three per animal, reacted positively with the antiserum. Immunofluorescence histochemistry was used to demonstrate neurophysin-like antigen in tissue slices. Initially tissue was frozen unfixed and sectioned in a cryostat prior to fixation in 95% (v/v) aqueous ethanol. subsequently an improved method was developed in which tissues were fixed in saline-formalin and embedded in paraffin and immunohistochemistry carried out on deparaffinised sections. Immunofluorescence on tissue fixed in saline formalin was more intense and cells were resolved more sharply than on slices of fresh-frozen tissue. Neurophysin antigen was observed in the magnocellular nuclei of adult rats, guinea-pigs and rabbits and also in accessory cell groups in the hypothalamus. Material reactive against anti-neurophysin sera was also present in the neurohypophysis. Furthermore, neurophysin-like material was demonstrated in axons of the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial fibre tracts, especially in guinea-pig tissue slices. Immunoreactive material in axons was more abundant in tissue from dehydrated guinea-pigs. Neurophysin-like antigen, as detected by immunodiffusion and immunofluorescence was depleted in the neural lobes of dehydrated rate. Staining by aldehyde fuchsin showed that dehydration also caused a reduction in neurosecretory material in rat neurohypophyses. In the guinea-pig neurohypophysis, neurosecretory material was observed to have a lobular distribution whereas immunofluorescence was lobular on frozen sections but of even intensity on paraffin sections. Dehydration caused a depletion of histochemically-detected material in the guinea-pig neural lobe. Immunofluorescence histochemistry enabled detection of neurophysin antigen in rat hypothalami at 17 days gestational age. Fetal calves of 130 days and rabbits of 29 days gestation were also seen to have immunoreactive material in the hypothalamus and neural lobe. Evidence for modification of neurophysin-like material in the perikaryon or in proximal parts of the axona of the guinea-pig hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system was obtained by observing the effects of different treatments of HNS tissue blocks and slices on histological stains. Elements of the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system which were stained by immunofluorescence were not always stained by aldehyde fuchsin dye.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3115</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community-based strategies to address youth suicide: development, implementation and formative evaluation</field><field name="creator">Coggan, Ann Carolyn</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the Youth Suicide Prevention Project, the aims of which were to develop, implement, and evaluate community-based strategies to address youth suicide. The focus of the evaluation was formative and was designed to constructively influence all the components of the project. The overall goal of the project was to provide information likely to improve the health and wellbeing of young people and thereby contribute, in the long term, to a reduction in youth suicide. This project, which was undertaken by Ms Coggan over a period of 26 months, involved collaboration with the Mental Health Foundation, and included the participation of community groups and young people. While several community-based strategies to address youth suicide were developed and implemented as part of this project, only three were central components of the Youth Suicide Prevention Project. The first strategy involved the use of a questionnaire designed to obtain information on the range and level of risk-taking behaviours occurring among young people and their perceptions of health-harming activities. The information obtained both assisted a local community to develop strategies to enhance the health and wellbeing of its young people and provided information to policy-makers on the extent of risk-taking behaviour and its association with self-harm. The second community-based strategy was the development and trialing of a teaching resource for use in forms three and four. This resource (Mental Health Matters) was designed to provide students with an opportunity to acquire information and skills to better promote and protect their mental health. The final strategy involved the conduct of a community action programme focused exclusively on youth health. Included in this programme was the provision and dissemination of local information on youth health and the conduct of three workshops: i) developing a mentally healthy school; ii) improving the identification, referral and acute management of suicidal young people; and iii) a community activation workshop designed to allow a community to prioritise strategies to improve youth health. Four aspects of formative input to the Youth Suicide Prevention Project are reported in this thesis: the developmental phase, the Youth Health and Risk-taking Survey, the Mental Health Matters programme, and the Youth Health Community Action Programme. This has involved the review of literature; the use of archival data and records; attendance at meetings; participant observation; the identification of evaluation procedures and methods; the design of data collection techniques; qualitative and quantitative data analyses including consultation with a statistician; and report preparation and timely dissemination both to the participants and to the wider community. The main findings of this evaluation indicated: that adopting a range of 15-24 years for youth was not realistic; that the occurrence of youth suicide and attempted suicide was spread evenly within the North Health region; that young people and school personnel saw a need for health promotion strategies to be developed; that young people identified a need for information on how to help themselves and others in times of crisis; that young people at school would provide information on a range of risk-taking activities; that high levels of risk-taking were occurring among young people at school; that an association exists between certain risk-taking behaviour and self-harm; that the provision of local information on youth risk-taking behaviour could act as a stimulus for the development of community-based strategies to address these; that a curriculum based programme with a positive focus on mental health should, with modification, be implemented nationally; that there is a need for the wider community to have information to dispel the myths surrounding suicide and suicide ideation; and that it is possible to successfully conduct a community action project exclusively focused on the health needs of young people. Major implications identified for future projects were the importance of providing relevant and local data to enable a community to develop strategies to address youth health issues and the need to further examine the high levels of risk-taking behaviours and the association of risk-taking behaviour and self-harm. This project also showed that teachers and students supported the further development of a curriculum-based programme called Mental Health Matters. This project also highlighted the need for an ongoing process of interaction between the community and research-based knowledge to ensure that strategies, proposed by the community are able so be implemented. Finally, while there is a need to focus on youth at risk, this thesis has demonstrated a need to provide the wider community with information and resources to dispel all the myths that surround suicide and suicide ideation.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3099</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Radar/Gdf6a function during zebrafish (Danio rerio)embryogenesis</field><field name="creator">Hall, Christopher James</field><field name="description">In the early vertebrate embryo, the vascular system is one of the first organ systems to form. Recently it has become evident that the development of mature, functional vessels requires not only signals derived from the endothelium itself, but a set of additional molecules that are not necessarily endothelium-specific. In zebrafish and Xenopus embryos two such tissues that are believed to secrete modulators of blood vessel assembly are the hypochord and primitive gut endoderm (PGE). These tissues intimately border the major axial vasculature. Radar/Growth/differentiation factor 6a (Gdf6a) represents a signalling molecule belonging to the GDF5, 6, 7 subgroup of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-&#946;) superfamily. In the zebrafish, transcripts for radar are located in the hypochord, PGE and ventral tail mesenchyme (VTM), all tissues that border the developing axial blood vessels. This prompted an investigation into a potential role for this signalling bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) during the specification and assembly of the closely related vascular and haematopoietic systems in the zebrafish. Transient forced expression experiments confirmed an early ventralising activity for the Radar signal that resulted in the expansion of the haematopoietic/vascular compartment, known as the intermediate cell mass (ICM). However, a loss-of-function zebrafish model generated using morpholino technology demonstrated a critical requirement for this BMP signal in establishing the integrity of the axial blood vessels. Furthermore, this requirement was independent of the initial establishment of vascular patterning. Zebrafish embryos depleted of the Radar signal initiate a normal primitive circulation. However, soon after this commencement of normal flow, blood cells were observed to extravasate from the axial vasculature. Microangiography confirmed this leakage phenotype. Such an angiogenic/maturation role for Radar during vascular development was supported by a transgenic zebrafish line carrying an inducible copy of the radar gene. Homozygous transgenic embryos established a typical early circulation that became progressively restricted until no blood travelled throughout the entire embryonic tissue. In summary, the work presented in this thesis strongly suggests that Radar is involved in a signalling pathway required for establishing the integrity of the axial vessels during zebrafish development.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3101</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Renal blood flow in the conscious, unrestrained rat</field><field name="creator">Grady, Heather</field><field name="description">The aim of this project is to test the hypothesis that the rate of renal blood flow remains constant under normal physiological conditions. Methods were developed for long term studies of renal blood flow (using the Doppler flow probe) and blood pressure in the conscious unrestrained rat. Special care was taken to maintain and observe the rats under normal, physiological conditions. Since the Doppler flow probe measures blood velocity rather than flow, changes in renal arterial diameter will alter the output of the flow meter, even if flow is constant. In order to measure flow more accurately, chanqes in vessel diameter were prevented by a short length of silastic tubing inserted into the renal, ortery under the probe. Blood flow was expressed as a percentage of the maximal flow measured when the animal was completely relaxed. Using this preparation, renal blood flow was measured continuously under normal conditions in both the light and dark cycles. Studies were performed to assess the effects on renal blood flow of anaesthesia, surgery and stress, and to assess the effect on renal blood flow of blockade of the renal nerves. Renal blood flow was depressed approximately 50% by anaesthesia, due to the effects of the anaesthetic agent rather than the accompanying surgery. Renal blood flow did not fully recover for 3-4 days after anaesthesia with, or without surgery. Renal blood flow was depressed by stress, even though blood pressure was unchanged. A mild sudden auditory disturbance caused a transient 23% fall in renal blood flow. A continuous auditory disturbance, depressed renal blood flow by 16% for several minutes. Handling the rat resulted in a 33% fall in renal blood flow which lasted for over 30 minutes. When measured continuously, renal blood flow was found to vary considerably. When the rat was completely relaxed renal blood flow was highest (defined as 100%). Renal blood flow remained high when eating and drinking (79%), but fell when the rat became alert but completely still (74%). During general movement renal blood flow was low (73%) with flow lowest while grooming (64%). Flow was apparently related to the degree of alertness and to activity. The extent of variation of flow is such that the calculated mean daily value of renal blood flow was only 80% of the maximum flow observed during complete relaxation. The depression of renal blood flow seen during activity and disturbance was largely prevented during reversible blockade of the ipsilateral renal nerve, induced by slow infusion of xylocaine around the renal artery. It was completely abolished by bilateral renal nerve blockade with Xylocaine. The depressive effects of activity and disturbance on renal blood flow were restored an hour after the Xylocaine infusion ceased. These studies clearly show that renal nerve is involved in control of renal blood flow under physiological conditions. It is clear that renal blood flow varies markedly under normal physiological conditions and in response to the external environment. A constant renal blood flow is not a necessity for normal renal function.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320600 Medical Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3141</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Honey and venous leg ulceration: a systematic review &amp; randomised controlled trial</field><field name="creator">Jull, Andrew</field><field name="description">Aims: To investigate the effect of honey on wound healing by conducting [1] a systematic review of trials of honey in wound care and [2] a randomised controlled trial of honey-impregnated dressings for the treatment of venous leg ulcers (the HALT trial). Systematic review: Method - The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, AMED and LILACS were searched for controlled trials using honey for any type of patient with an acute or chronic wound. Honey manufacturers and researchers were contacted, citations scrutinised and the internet searched. Data from included studies were combined where studies were sufficiently alike. Findings - 18 trials were included. Honey significantly decreased healing time compared to conventional dressings for partial thickness burns (WMD -4.7 days, 95%Cl -5.1 to -4.3), but delayed healing time in comparison to early excision and skin grafting for mixed partial and deep thickness burns (WMD 25 days, 95%Cl 17.4 to 32.6). No significant effect was found for minor acute wounds or for honey compared to silver sulfadiazine in partial thickness burns. There were no trials of honey for treating venous leg ulcers. Randomised controlled trial: Method - The HALT trial was a pragmatic, open label randomised trial. Participants received either a manuka honey-impregnated calcium alginate dressing (n=187) or usual care (n=181) for 12weeks. Both groups received compression bandaging. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with healed ulcers at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes were time to healing, change in ulcer area, incidence of infection, adverse events, health-related quality of life and cost-effectiveness. Findings -104 participants in the honey-treated (55.6%) group and 90 (49.7%) in the usual care group healed at 12 weeks (absolute increase 5.9%, 95%Cl -4.3% to 15.7%, p=0.3). Time to healing was not significantly different between the groups (mean difference -1.8 days, 95%Cl -7.7 to 4.1, p=0.5), nor was change in ulcer area (mean difference 0.9cm2, 95%Cl -1.4cm2 to 3.2cm2, p=0.4)incidence of infection (absolute decrease 5.0%, 95%Cl -3.1% to 13.1%, p=0.2), ulcer recurrence (absolute increase 5.2%, 95%Cl -0.4% to 10.7%, p=0.1), or quality of life. The average cost of community-based treatment per participant was higher in the honey-treated group (NZ$862 versus NZ$795). More adverse events were reported in the honey-treated group (RR 1.3, 95%Cl 1.1 to 1.6, p=0.01). More participants reported pain as an adverse event when treated with honey (RR 2.5, 95%Cl 1.5 to 4.2, p=0.0001). Interpretation: Systematic review - Honey may be an effective treatment for partial thickness burns in comparison to conventional dressings. Honey does not appear to benefit healing in other acute wounds and may delay healing in mixed and partial thickness burns compared to excision and grafting. The HALT trial - Honey-impregnated dressings did not have any significant positive effect on venous ulcer healing and were more expensive than usual care. Participants treated with honey experienced more pain than control participants.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3132</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isolation, characterisation and evolution of zebrafish (Danio rerio) bmp9, bmp10 and gdf11</field><field name="creator">Bland, Ross James</field><field name="description">Three members of the TGF&#946; superfamily, bmp9, bmp10 and gdf11 were isolated from zebrafish genomic and cDNA libraries to further elucidate the role of these genes during embryogenesis. Zebrafish bmp9 and bmp10 belong to the BMP9/10 subfamily. The level of sequence similarity between the zebrafish and mammalian BMP9/10 subfamily members prompted an investigation into the evolutionary relationships of the zebrafish genes. The orthology of bmp9 and bmp10 were examined by phylogenetic and syntenic analysis. Phylogenetic analysis grouped bmp9, DSLI, Bmp9 and BMP9 into a single clade and bmp10, Bmp10 and BMP10 into another. Zebrafish bmp9 and human BMP9 were mapped to linkage group 12 and chromosome 17, respectively, and share syntenic relationships with a number of other genes mapped onto these respective chromosomes. Zebrafish bmp10 and human BMP10 were mapped to linkage group 5 and chromosome 2, respectively, and share syntenic relationships with mcm6/MCM6 and pax8/PAX8. The phylogenetic and syntenic analyses support the orthology of bmp9 and bmp10 to human BMP9 and BMP10, respectively. The phylogenetic analysis also suggests that chick DSL1 is not a unique member of the TGF&#946; superfamily but is the chicken ortholog of BMP9/Bmp9. The expression patterns of bmp9 and bmp10 were analysed by RT-PCR, Northern analysis, and by whole mount in situ hybridisation. No specific expression pattern was detected for either bmp9 or bmp10 by whole mount in situ hybridisation, indicating the low expression levels of these genes. The lower than expected sequence similarity to the mammalian orthologs and the low level of expression suggest a lack of evolutionary pressure between subfamily members. Zebrafish Gdf11 shows a high level of amino acid identity over the length of the entire protein to mouse GDF11. Phylogenetic analysis grouped gdf11, Gdf11 and GDF11 into a single clade. Zebrafish gdf11 and human GDF11 were mapped to linkage group 11 and chromosome 12, respectively, and share syntenic relationships with atp5b/ATP5b, dspg3/DSPG3, hoxcb/HOXC, and plasticin/PRPH on LG11/Hsa12. The phylogenetic and syntenic analyses, therefore, support the orthology of gdf11 to human GDF11. The expression pattern of gdf11 was analysed by whole mount in situ hybridisation. Expression of gdf11 was detected in both the dorsal and vegetal tail bud progenitors and during segmentation stages, expression becomes restricted to the caudal-most chordamesoderm of the tail bud. During the pharyngula stage, dynamic expression of gdf11 was detected in neural structures including the ventral hindbrain, midbrain and the forebrain. Expression of gdf11 was absent in the tail bud of ntlb195 mutant embryos but present in neural structures, indicating that the expression of gdf11 is regulated by different factors in these tissues. The function of gdf11 was analysed by microinjection of synthetic gdf11 mRNA. Overexpression of gdf11, however, resulted in the severe dorsalisation of the embryo, probably due to activation of a Nodal specific pathway.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3133</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microglial activation and inhibition: implications for neurodegeneration</field><field name="creator">Gibbons, Hannah Mary</field><field name="description">Accumulating evidence over the past 20 years has indicated that the brain has an endogenous immune system, mediated at the local level predominantly by microglial cells. The primary role of an inflammatory response is to protect the host against a foreign stimulus, remove damaged cells and to initiate repair and regeneration of damaged tissue. However, it has become increasingly evident that this inflammatory response, in addition to its role in host defence and repair, can exert detrimental effects in the central nervous system (CNS). Neuroinflammation, as this response is now commonly known, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases. Microglia, the resident macrophage of the brain, play a central role in sustaining this inflammatory response through the release of proinflammatory and potentially cytotoxic mediators. Hypothermia is neuroprotective, and these properties are thought to be mediated, in part, by the suppression of microglial activation. The BV-2 microglial cell line was used to investigate the mechanisms involved in the activation and inhibition of microglia. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced activation of BV-2 cells led to the up-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, the release of inflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin (PG)-E2, interleukin (IL)-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945;, and a change to a phagocytic phenotype. This response was mediated by the initiation of signal transduction pathways that culminated in transcription and translation of the inflammatory genes. Hypothermia (33&#176;C) caused complete suppression of iNOS and NO whilst displaying little or no effect on IL-6 and TNF-&#945; respectively. In contrast, LPS-induced COX-2 expression and PGE2 release was super-induced in response to hypothermia. A co-culture model of neuroinflammation was developed to investigate microglial-neuronal interactions. LPS/interferon (IFN)-&#947; activated BV-2 cells required direct contact with SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells to elicit a cytotoxic phenotype. Hypothermia and the selective iNOS inhibitor S-methylisothiourea (S-MT) protected against this BV-2-induced SK-N-SH cell death, strongly implicating NO as the major candidate molecule in microglial-induced neuronal cell death. Thus, microglial activation sustains the chronic inflammatory response in the CNS and in doing so contributes to further neuronal death. Inhibition of the detrimental facets of microglial activation may provide some protection against neurodegeneration.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320500 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3135</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Insulin-like growth factors and their binding proteins in post-natal ruminants</field><field name="creator">Hodgkinson, Steven Charles</field><field name="description">Observations that IGF is produced and acts locally in multiple tissues raise important questions about the biological significance of the major pool of IGF present in the circulation. Does it represent a pool of endocrine IGF en route to the tissues or conversely growth factor produced in excess of autocrine/paracrine requirements undergoing elimination? The primary objective of this thesis was to examine the kinetics and distribution of circulating IGF in sheep with a view to determining tissue destinations and thereby potential functions of the blood borne hormone. The IGFBP play a central role in facilitating IGF action. Characterization studies of the IGFBP and an examination of their physiology and potential involvement in IGF transport are also important parts of this thesis. Such studies are necessary because potential therapeutic uses of IGF will depend on systemic administration and endocrine action. Early work involved structural/functional characterization of a batch of recombinant methionyl insulin-like growth factor-I (N-Met IGF-I) designated for this project. The peptide was heterogenous on reversed phase chromatography eluting as two major peaks of approximate abundance 1:2. These each had the amino acid constitution expected of N-Met IGF-I and were carefully characterized in a range of binding and biological assays. Whereas the early eluting peptide demonstrated much reduced activity in each assay system, the second peak proved equipotent to a highly purified ovine plasma IGF-I preparation and was chosen for the investigative work of this thesis. The early eluting peptide may represent a variant with mismatched disulphides. Initial characterization of IGF binding activity in ovine tissue fluids was performed by competitive IGF tracer binding techniques together with size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and IGF-I affinity chromatography. Binding proteins (BP) of &gt;200, 150 and 40-50 kDa were revealed in these studies and shown to be widely distributed in body fluids. Thus the &gt;200 kDa binding protein, which is IGF-II specific, was identified in adult sheep plasma, colostrum, follicular fluid and fetal sheep plasma, and may be the ovine equivalent of the soluble type 2 IGF receptor. A 150 kDa binding protein complex, of mixed specificity for IGF-I and II, was also identified. In addition to vascular fluids, the 150 kDa complex was identified in mammay lymph, follicular fluid and, as a minor component, in vitreous humor. Binding proteins of 40-50 kDa were revealed in every fluid tested and multiple variants identified with distinct specificities for the IGF peptides. The BP 'make-up' of fluids and of 150 kDa and 40-50 kDa pools isolated by preliminary SEC was latter examined by IGF ligand blot analysis. Analysis of plasma 150 kDa pools revealed only the characteristic doublet of IGFBP-3 at 40-43 kDa, whereas the 40-50 kDa pool was heterogeneous containing IGFBP-3 together with smaller bands of 35, 30 and 23 kDa which may be the ovine equivalents of IGFBP-2, BP-4 and possibly BP-1. In support of the tracer binding data, IGFBP-3 was also identified in mammary lymph as were the smaller species. In an extension of the in vitro IGF tracer binding/SEC approach, kinetics of IGF equilibration with plasma binding sites was examined. Binding was found to be time and temperature dependent, reversible, dose responsive and relatively specific for the IGF peptides. Observations of special interest include a biphasic pattern of IGF-I equilibration with plasma, consistent with formation of the ternary 150 kDa complex of IGFBP-3, IGF and ALS, and evidence of relatively slow dissociation of IGF/BP complexes, suggesting that if release of IGF is required for full expression of IGF bioactivity in vivo, then specific processes may be involved. Avidity of isolated IGFBP complexes for Con A and heparin affinity adsorbents was also examined. The data indicate that the IGFBP belong to a relatively select group of proteins with high affinity for the glycosaminoglycan heparin suggesting roles for these proteins at the level of the capillary endothelium and/or extra-cellular matrix. Metabolic clearance of IGF-I and II was examined following intravenous (iv) bolus injection of the growth factors as radioiodinated tracer preparations. Tracer administration was followed by a rapid initial phase of clearance associated with tracer mixing in the vascular pool followed by intermediate and longer phases which appear to be direct consequences of interaction with and between the BP and to some extent accumulation of tracer degradation products in the circulation. Metabolic clearance of tracer complexed to the major molecular weight pools of BP was examined following SEC of sequential plasma samples. Average half-lives for IGF-I and II complexed to the 150 KDa and 40-50 kDa pools of carrier protein were established (150 kDa; 545&#177;25 min, 325&#177;30 min; 40-50 kDa, 34&#177;2 min, 9.6&#177;1.8 min, (mean&#177;S.E.M., IGF-I and II respectively)) and compared to free IGF-I (t1/2 &lt;5 min). Rapid clearance of free compared to bound IGF illustrates the central role of the IGFBP in maintaining IGF in the circulation and controlling tissue distribution. Whereas binding of IGF-II to different BP at 40-50 kDa (eg. IGFBP-2) may explain its shorter half-life compared with IGF-I, evidence suggests that IGF-I and II bind to the same carrier at 150 kDa. The observed difference in half-life of the 150 kDa complex is therefore suggestive of different metabolic handling of the BP depending on which of the IGFs is bound. The more rapid clearance of IGF-II complexed to the 150 kDa and 40-50 kDa carriers compared to IGf-I contributed to a more rapid clearance overall and is reflected in calculated metabolic clearance rates for IGF-I and II (IGF-I, 3.9 ml/min; IGF-II, 7.8 ml/min). Considering plasma IGF-II is significantly higher than IGF-I in post-natal sheep, a substantially greater secretion rate for IGF-II would be required to maintain plasma IGF-II in the face of the greater clearance rate. The secretion rate for IGF-II was estimated at ~ 1.6 nmol/min in the current study, some 8-fold greater than IGF-I. Clearance of IGF-I from plasma was associated with the appearance of radioactivity in lymph. Chromatography indicated that tracer in lymph was not degraded but retained its BP activity eluting on SEC complexed to high molecular weight BP. The data illustrate that blood borne IGF is distributed into the extra vascular space and may therefore be available to the tissues. This contention is supported by observations that relatively little radioactivity (&lt;20% in the course of these experiments) was cleared from plasma into urine suggesting that plasma IGF is not principally an elimination form. Similarly no other significant sites of elimination were identified. Questions of how physiological control of the BP may influence tissue distribution of IGF were investigated in the next major experimental section of this thesis. In the first study the influence of nutritional manipulation and GH treatment of growing lambs on the molecular distribution of IGF immunoreactivity in plasma was examined using a new IGF-I RIA in conjunction with SEC and saturation analysis for the estimation of the BP. Total plasma IGF-I was found to increase with nutritional intake (P&lt;0.01) and with GH treatment (0.25 mg/kg body weight/d; P&lt;0.001) but only on the higher intakes. Molecular size fractionation revealed IGF-I immunoreactivity in 150 kDa and 40-50 kDa binding fractions. 150 kDa bound IGF-I was increased on the higher plane of nutrition(P&lt;0.05) and by GH treatment (P&lt;0.001) but again, only at higher levels of nutrition. By contrast no change in 40-50 kDa bound IGF-I was observed with treatment. Unbound IGF-I was also identified in sheep plasma (2-5% of total) but demonstrated only slight changes in relation to treatment. Saturation analysis was an analytical approach chosen to estimate total binding capacity (TBC) and relative saturation of the binding protein pools. Evidence suggests that in ovine plasma constituents of the 150 kDa complex are available in excess of endogenous IGF (P&lt;0.001). Relative saturation of this species did not change with treatment despite the observed differences in 150 kDa bound IGF-I. The data suggest that components of the 150 kDa complex were themselves responsive to treatment. By contrast large differences in saturation of the 40-50 kDa species were observed (P&lt;0.001) despite little treatment dependent change in bound IGF-I. Binding capacity of the 40-50 kDa fraction was elevated at low levels of nutrition and suppressed on the higher feed intake resulting in near saturation. The data indicate complex regulation of the IGFBP in sheep. IGF-I, elevated in response to higher nutritional intake and by CH treatment was mostly distributed into the 150 kDa complex; paradoxically the species which most effectively maintains IGF in the circulation. Thus in conditions presumably conducive with growth related processes (high GH, high nutrition) access of circulating IGF to the tissues is apparently most restricted. This evidence is difficult to reconcile with the view that 150kDa bound IGF represents a pool of endocrine IGF en route to tissue sites of action. Galactopoietic effects of GH in lactating ruminants appear to be exerted in the absence of a mammary GH receptor and are associated with increased plasma and mammary IGF-I content. Thus it has been proposed that blood borne IGF, acting in the classical endocrine fashion may be the mediator of GHs lactogenic effects. Consequently the lactating sheep surgically prepared by the catheterization of efferent mammary lymph may be a useful model for examining questions of IGF/BP physiology. In a further study, plasma and efferent mammary lymph concentrations of IGF-I were determined in lactating ewes before and after treatment with GH (10 mg/d) for 3 days. Analysis of paired plasma/lymph samples revealed that the capillary endothelium constitutes a barrier to the passage of macro molecules which reduces the concentration of IGF in lymph to ~ 35% plasma. A key observation from the current study was the GH dependence of mammary lymph IGF-I. Thus, GH was found to increase mammary lymph IGF-I concentrations by a proportionately greater amount than the increase in plasma IGF-I (P&lt;0.01). The increase in lymph IGF-I resulted from an increase in the concentration of IGF associated with both high molecular weight (150 kDa) and low molecular weight (40-50 kDa) binding fractions. However, the data indicate a proportionately greater increase in 40-50 kDa bound IGF-I in lymph compared with plasma suggesting that treatment either induces a selective redistribution of plasma 40-50 kDa IGF and BP into the mammary gland or, alternatively, treatment increases intra-mammary production of these factors. Ligand blot analysis of mammary lymph revealed IGFBP-3 and -2 as the major constituents of this fluid. IGFBP-2 declined in lymph with GH treatment whereas IGFBP-3 appeared to increase. Additionally, saturation analysis indicated that a substantial proportion of lymph IGFBP-3 was present in the 'free', uncomplexed form. Consequently observations that the total binding capacity (TBC) of the lymph 40-50 kDa fraction increased with treatment, would appear to result from an increase in IGFBP-3. Total binding capacity of the lymph 40-50 kDa binding fraction was found to increase by a proportionately greater amount that its plasma equivalent. Thus, if the lactogenic effects of GH are mediated by IGF distributed from blood into the mammary gland, the mechanism by which it is transferred would appear to involve BP of the 40-50 kDa pool and in particular IGFBP-3. In the final experimental section of this thesis a novel system was employed to examine tissue distribution and destinations of blood borne IGF-I. This involved intravenous infusion of the N-Met analog of IGF-I together with specific immunologic detection. For this an IGF antibody was employed which recognises the recombinant N-Met variant but demonstrates minimal cross-reactivity with any of a range of other IGF peptides including ovine plasma IGF-I and recombinant authentic sequence IGF-I. This antibody can therefore recognise the N-Met variant against a background of authentic endogenous IGF-I and was usefully applied to examining tissue destinations of the N-Met variant following iv infusion. Plasma N-Met IGF-I rose to plateau concentrations of ~150 ng/ml during iv infusion (Infusion rate, 8 &#181;g/kg/h). Analysis revealed the N-Met variant was distributed on plasma BP in much the same proportion as endogenous IGF. N-Met IGF-I immunoreactivity was identified in mammary lymph providing further evidence supporting the contention that blood borne IGF is distributed outside the vascular space. At the end of the infusion N-Met IGF-I was identified in all tissues examined contributing between 35% (in kidney) and 62% (spleen) to total IGF. Major differences in morphological distribution of blood derived (N-Met IGF) were revealed by autoradiography in post infusion tissue slices. Thus the N-Met IGF was found to contribute relatively little to total localizable IGF-I immunoreactivity in connective tissue elements of the samples examined (muscle and mammary) but, by contrast, blood derived (N-Met) IGF-I constituted ~85% of total IGF immunoreactivity in other tissues. In particular, these include the metabolically active regions of muscle and mammary (fibre and epithelium respectively). The evidence suggests therefore that fibre and epithelium may be targets for blood derived &#8216;endocrine' IGF. Differences in the abundance of blood derived IGF between tissues may relate to the accessibility (vascularization or capillary permeability) of specific tissues or, alternatively, to local rates of production and turnover of IGF in tissues. Thus the contribution of blood derived IGF to total localizable IGF may be expected to be less in tissues which actively synthesize IGF such as those in which autocrine/paracrine modes of IGF action are operative. Examples from the current study would be connective tissues of muscle and mammary. Conversely blood derived IGF would be expected to represent a greater proportion of total IGF in tissue targets for endocrine IGF. Support for the current data was obtained from IGF-I mRNA in situ hybridization studies performed on human fetal tissue (437). Stromal elements of muscle tissue (perimysium, epimysium) were identified as active sites of transcription as opposed to muscle fibre where message could not be detected. Thus the evidence suggests that the N-Met infusion model is a useful technique for delineating tissue targets for circulating (endocrine) IGF. It is now widely accepted that the primary actions of IGF on growth and development occur via autocrine/paracrine mechanisms close to its site of production. Nonetheless such arguments do not exclude the possibility of classical endocrine roles for the major pool of IGF present in the circulation. The primary thrust of this thesis has been to examine kinetics and tissue distribution of this pool of IGF. The data confirm the availability of blood borne IGF to extra vascular tissues and appear to indicate that it is distributed into the tissues on a selective basis and under physiological control. It may, therefore, be available to selected tissues to fill specific endocrine functions.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3104</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Paediatric bronchiectasis in Auckland, New Zealand : non-invasive screening for ciliary dysfunction and airway inflammation</field><field name="creator">Edwards, Elizabeth Anne</field><field name="description">Background: &#8216;Bronchiectasis&#8217; is usually a progressive disease defined as bronchial dilatation, with or without associated bronchial wall and lung parenchymal damage, and classically with pus in the bronchial lumen. There is no knowledge on the prevalence, aetiology, and severity of paediatric bronchiectasis in New Zealand. Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an inherited disorder that can cause bronchiectasis and is characterised by specific structural ciliary abnormalities leading to impaired ciliary motility. It has been suggested that ciliary abnormalities may predispose Maori and Pacific Island people to bronchiectasis, but appropriate expertise and non-invasive technology to accurately investigate the condition has not been available in New Zealand. Additionally the exhaled gas nitric oxide (NO), a non-invasive marker of some types of airway inflammation, has been suggested as a useful screening test for PCD. The aims of this thesis were to: 1. Define the demographics, causes, and severity of the known paediatric bronchiectasis population of Auckland. 2. Establish a method for detecting primary and secondary ciliary dysfunction. 3. Explore non-invasive methods for differentiating primary and secondary ciliary disease. 4. Determine the prevalence of PCD in paediatric bronchiectasis in Auckland. Methods: Observations were made on children with bronchiectasis who attended the Starship Children's Hospital, and a cohort of healthy children recruited from local Auckland schools. A retrospective review of the demographics and radiology scores (CXR and HRCT scan) as a measure of disease severity was made. The results were compiled into a bronchiectasis database and a measure of socio-economic factors (NZDep96 index) was incorporated. Equipment was created for the photometric method of assessment of ciliary beat frequency (CBF). After piloting, 3prospective studies were undertaken to evaluate skin prick allergy tests, exhaled and nasal NO, lung function and a nasal brushing for assessment of CBF and ultrastructural analysis in the normal and diseased children. Results. The estimated prevalence of paediatric bronchiectasis in Auckland was ~2/10,000 and was disproportionately more common in the Pacific Island (6.3/10,000) and Maori children (2.8/10,000). Eighty eight percent of cases had bilateral disease, and 64% had 4 or more lobes involved. There was a wide range of presumed aetiologies but over half remained undiagnosed despite extensive investigation. The median duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 3.2 years, and a median of 4 respiratory admissions pre-diagnosis. The NZDep96 index suggested significant associated socio-economic deprivation. A non-invasive protocol to brush nasal epithelium and the technology to assess CBF was created and piloted. Ethnic normal values were established for NO and CBF for healthy European and Pacific Island children. Insufficient Maori children could be recruited. CBF and NO values were not low and comparable with frequencies reported internationally using similar methodologies. Exhaled NO levels did not differ significantly between the children with bronchiectasis and controls, or between the bronchiectatic children who were and were not prescribed inhaled steroids. However CBF and nasal NO were lower in the children with bronchiectasis than controls. The percentage of abnormal ciliary structural defects in the control children was 3 times higher than reported controls, with no difference across ethnic groups. Similar abnormalities were seen in the children with bronchiectasis. These abnormalities were central microtubule defects, tubular additions or deletions, and partial dynein arm defects. In the individual children with bronchiectasis who had low CBF and nasal NO, no single primary ciliary defect was identified to conclusively diagnose PCD. Conclusions: Paediatric bronchiectasis is common and severe in Auckland. New Zealand but the condition has been neglected in terms of recognition. It is hoped that the establishment of a bronchiectasis database for children will not only facilitate collaborative research but also act as a template for a national bronchiectasis database for New Zealand, which can be used to support applications for health resources and funding. Importantly the thesis has resulted in a non-invasive method for assessing ciliary structure and function that could be used to investigate New Zealand children and adults. A wide variety of ciliary abnormalities were found in the New Zealand children that were most likely secondary phenomena, and the incidence of PCD in the population examined, if present, is small. More work is needed to increase the ciliary structural and functional 'library' for New Zealand children, and particularly for Maori children who were under assessed in this work. The possibility of another vulnerability factor, as yet not identified, either of innate immunity or airway defences may still underlie the high prevalence of bronchiectasis in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3137</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional and structural analyses of an olfactory receptor from Drosophila melanogaster</field><field name="creator">Kiely, Aidan</field><field name="description">In insects, olfaction is mediated by a large family of integral membrane proteins, called olfactory receptors (ORs), that mediate the transduction of odorant binding into a neuronal signal. A functional assay for insect ORs was developed utilising calcium imaging in Sf9 cells. The Drosophila melanogaster OR, Or22a, was expressed using transient transfection, and its activity measured by monitoring increased intracellular calcium levels using a calcium&#8211;sensitive dye. The interaction of the odorants ethyl butyrate, pentyl acetate and ethyl acetate with Or22a were both dose&#8211;dependent and sensitive, with EC50 values of 1.53 x 10&#8722;11 M, 5.61 x 10&#8722;10 M and 3.72 x 10&#8722;9 M, respectively. Furthermore, Or22a expressed in Sf9 cells has a similar response profile to a range of odorants previously tested in vivo. This assay system will provide a useful tool for the investigation of insect olfactory receptor structure and function. A consensus of eleven transmembrane (TM) domain prediction algorithms suggested a model for Or22a that contains seven TM domains, reminiscent of GPCRs. To test this model empirically, the membrane topology of Or22a was determined using epitope&#8211;tagging of predicted loops followed by immunochemistry. These experiments revealed that Or22a has seven TM domains but that its orientation in the membrane is opposite to that of GPCRs, having a cytoplasmic N&#8211;terminus. This orientation was also observed for Epiphyas postvittana Or1, which suggests that this inverted topology may be common to all insect ORs. To test whether Or22a forms higher order structures, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins inserted into the intracellular loops of Or22a was employed. The third intracellular loop interacts strongly with itself in homo&#8211;multimers, with interactions between the first and first loops and first and third loops also observed. These experiments show that ligand binding ORs can form multimeric structures in heterologous cells. The co&#8211;transfection of Or83b into S2 cells had no impact on these interactions, however Or83b is likely expressed in this cell line. Finally, models of how a ligand binding OR interacts physically with the ion channel Or83b are presented, and approaches that could be used to distinguish between these models are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270505 Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3342</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expression and activity of enzymes in the human placenta: pharmacological &amp; toxicological consequences in AZT therapy</field><field name="creator">Collier, Abby Cherise</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to study xenobiotic metabolising enzymes (XME) in the human placenta, in particular the uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases' (UGTs) role in the metabolism, transfer and disposition of the drug AZT, and to develop the human placental perfusion model into the first trimester. UGT, &#946;-glucuronidase, Cytochrome p4501A (CYPIA) and CYP reductase were present and active in the human placenta. CYP2E1 protein was expressed but not active. CYPIA, CYP2EI and the UGT2B subfamily were expressed across gestation, but the UGTIA subfamily was only expressed in first trimester placentas. The localisation of XME (the syncytiotrophoblast layer bordering the placental villi) did not change with gestation but enzyme activity and affinity did. Greater activify but lower affinity of UGT and CYPIA were observed in first trimester placentas than at term. In contrast, &#946;-glucuronidase had a high affinity, low activity profile in early gestation but the opposite at term. UGT and CYPIA activities in the first trimester placenta were induced by maternal cigarette smoking and may be synergistically induced by combined alcohol consumption and smoking. A significant correlation with higher UGT activity and earlier gestational age was observed. CYPIA exhibited a significant, negative correlation with maternal age across gestation. Maternal variables had no effect on &#946;-glucuronidase and their effects on the activity of CYP2EI and CYP reductase were not established. AZT caused apoptosis in the placenta and also increased reactive oxygen species and altered XME. The absence of serum enhanced these effects. Alterations in XME expression and activities included a decrease in UGT activity and increases in CYPIA, &#946;-glucuronidase, CYP reductase and glutathione-&#1029;-transferase activity in response to AZT exposure. AZT transport in a perfusion model was bi-directional and reached equilibrium approximately 3 h after addition of AZT into the maternal reservoir. In contrast, transfer of AZT glucuronide (AZT-G) showed significantly greater transport rates out of the fetal compartment resulting in AZT-G concentrations approximately 2-fold higher in the maternal circuit. Transfer of the co-factor UDPGA was significantly greater in the fetal direction and almost complete after 4h of perfusion. The low levels of glucuronidation of AZT catalysed by the human placenta (approximately 2% of a dose) are not due to insufficient transport of the co-factor UDPGA and are unlikely to be significant in terms of maternal whole-body clearance. Therapeutic failure of AZT in protecting the fetus is unlikely to be due to metabolism and clearance performed by the placenta but may be due to placental cytotoxicity. The development of the perfusion model into the first trimester placenta is technically achievable, but was impossible with the tissue available for these studies due to the method used to obtain placentas.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320500 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3138</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The prevalence, natural history, and determinants of non-synostotic plagiocephaly and brachycephaly in infants</field><field name="creator">Hutchison, Barbara Lynne</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3122</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Does District Planning under the Resource Management Act 1991 Protect Biodiversity?</field><field name="creator">Bellingham, Mark</field><field name="description">Biodiversity decline has continued at a rapid pace in New Zealand in the past 15 years (OECD 2007), in spite of specific provisions for biodiversity conservation under the Resource Management Act 1991 (Froude 1997, Bellingham 2004).  This thesis has examined problems with biodiversity conservation implementation in district plans, that arise from planners not making full use of the available factual base for district planning, a lack of monitoring in New Zealand&#8217;s RMA planning, and failures by ecologists and planners to properly understand and communicate information for effective district planning.  A critique of the policy and plan framework for biodiversity conservation in the Auckland Region and case studies in Rodney District and Waitakere City show there are strong provisions for biodiversity conservation in these plans that support the implementation of biodiversity conservation through district planning.  There was a moderate to high level of internal compatibility in the planning framework, apart from a policy conflict between urban growth and infrastructure development versus the protection of natural values and amenity.  Although the biodiversity factual base available for the Rodney District and Waitakere City district plans for district planning was sound, but it wasn&#8217;t often used to provide appropriate or sufficient information for district planning.  This was hampered by the poor state of the environment monitoring, and no process for monitoring the effects that resource consents and permitted activities were having on biodiversity condition.  This was exemplified by the discovery that the Rodney District Plan&#8217;s incentive-based regime for biodiversity conservation had failed to arrest the loss of 2.5% per annum of indigenous forest cover from 1977-1998.  This went undetected through a lack of plan monitoring.  In Waitakere City, district plan rules led to the indigenous vegetation cover on private land increasing by 0.5% per annum during the same period, and this was undetected by the council also.  District planning will continue to fail to achieve biodiversity conservation unless changes significant occur in planning practice, policy development and plan implementation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">district planning</field><field name="subject">biodiversity</field><field name="subject">RMA</field><field name="subject">resource management</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3406</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hypnosis, hypersensitivity and mood: some interactions between mind and body</field><field name="creator">Laidlaw, Tannis Marilyn</field><field name="description">Hypnosis has been used as a treatment modality to change physiological functioning almost since it was discovered. Particularly, it has been used in the treatment of psychosomatic illnesses. A series of studies was planned to explore the use of hypnosis within the context of recent advances in the field of psychoneuroimmunology. Type I hypersensitivity reactions were chosen as indicators of immunological functioning in allergy. Study One: This study using modern methodology and statistical analyses set out to test the hypothesis that it was possible to decrease reactions to histamine by hypnotic suggestion. Five subjects, all asthmatic and untrained in hypnosis, were given three hypnotic sessions where they were asked to control their reactions to histamine. These sessions were to be compared to three baseline sessions. A decrease in reactions was noted on the second administration of histamine calling into question studies that relied on a two session comparison. On subsequent sessions much unexplained variance was encountered, with the day upon which the sessions took place contributing significant amounts of the variance, giving rise to questions about what could cause these day to day changes. Study Two: Given the results of Study One, a method was subsequently devised in which serial, five-fold dilutions of allergen or histamine were administered to the subject's forearm with a standard Osterballe-type prick lancetter and reactions were recorded photographically on slide film. Areas were determined by computer-assisted image analysis. Seven healthy volunteers were tested for 8 sessions (testing included Profile of Moods Scale and Brief Mood Rating questionnaires, blood pressure, pulse and skin temperature). Mean wheal size and titration gradient data from allergen reactions correlated strongly with the psychological factor of liveliness but not irritability, although no manipulation of mood was involved. A stepwise regression analysis accounted for 61% of the variance of the allergen data, and 31% was from the liveliness factor alone. Thus, the more lively the subject felt, the smaller was the allergic response. The third study looked at a sample of 117 adult New Zealand subjects who volunteered to be tested with the Harvard Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility (Form A). 38 of these people also were tested on a second test used to assess hypnotisability, the Creative Imagination Scale. Results indicated that the CIS can be administered with a minimum of preamble negating the value of special "think-with" instructions. It appears from the evidence in this study that both the CIS and the HGSHS:A measure characteristics that are stable over the years since the tests were first published. Reassuringly, they both can be used throughout the adult age group, with neither age nor sex testing differentially. The means and standard deviations were found to be similar to those of university aged students from various countries and cultures around the world over the years. The two hypnotisability tests were found to be correlated with each other but on a factor analysis each loaded separately giving evidence that the two tests are assessing different but related abilities. Study Four was an intervention study using 38 subjects who participated in a control session and cognitive-hypnotic intervention session that used the skin test methodology developed in Study Two. When the results of the two sessions were compared, significant decreases were found in the size of the wheals after skin testing with allergen or histamine. The hypnotic method employed in this study used three specific procedures that appear to have contributed to the high success rate: challenge to the assumption that the subject has 'no imagination', self-generated scenes and the entire process had the seriousness removed so there was little or no fear of failure. Again, the significance of mood variables was considerable in ameliorating the skin test responses, and hypnotisability was a significant factor in predicting success at being able to use the intervention. Overall, these four studies have revealed that hypnosis can be used to change at least one aspect of physiological functioning, reactivity to skin tests. Mood variables have emerged as important mediators, with implications that mood should be assessed whenever physiological variables are being measured.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321021 Psychiatry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3139</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The carotid labyrinth in the primitive New Zealand frog, Leiopelma hochstetteri</field><field name="creator">Ensor, Donald Rivers</field><field name="description">The amphibian carotid labyrinth was first described in 1738, but its purpose has never been satisfactorily explained. Much of the extant literature has either been restricted to a particular aspect of the organ, or has been based on erroneous information. This thesis used the New Zealand frog Leiopelma hochstetteri because its primitive status might render some characteristics of the carotid labyrinth more clearly evident. The "gross" anatomy of the tiny (0.5 mm diameter) organ was examined by wax-plate reconstruction and by scanning electron microscopy. The cytology of the capillary plexus tissue was studied by light and transmission electron microscopy using conventionally prepared sections. The higher resolution of the electron microscope permitted a more exact study of the innervation of the organ. Neurophysiological experiments were undertaken, but the very short (0.6 mm) and fine carotid nerve proved intractable. A study of the in vivo flow of blood through the labyrinth, resolving the pulsatile variations in flow caused by the action of the heart, was first made by visual observation and then using instrumental methods. The tissues of the capillary plexus contain the same characteristic associations of Type I and Type II cells, together with nerve fibres, as are described in the carotid bodies of the Mammalia, and in the carotid labyrinths of other Amphibia. These associations, which are believed to represent chemoreceptor units, apparently have efferent synaptic complexes against the membrane of the Type I cell. The dense-cored vesicles within the Type I cells fall within the size range described for the other species. Similar characteristic cell groups, complete with nerve supplies, were also observed in the surrounding connective tissue. The carotid nerve contains about 15 myelinated and up to 150 fine (0.15-0.5&#181;m) unmyelinated axons and leaves the sheath of the lingual ramus of the glossopharyngeal nerve through a ganglion of 25-40 cells. It supplies the labyrinth alone. The capillary plexus tissue, in which the characteristic cells are dispersed, is a densely cellular connective tissue and provides a network of random channels for the throughflow of blood. Melanocytes, collagen and elastic fibres, and nerve fibres are embedded in the matrix. The organ is mechanically passive since the only smooth muscle is found as a thin layer in the proximal main chamber. Blood flow measurements utilized the moving erythrocytes as tracers. Their movement, visible through the semi-transparent arterial walls, was recorded with a television camera and later analyzed with a microkymograph. Simultaneous recording of the ECG-related velocity measurements to the phase of the cardiac cycle. Flow in the common carotid was markedly pulsatile, entering the labyrinth in bursts and causing it to swell, while flow in the internal carotid was steady. Flow in the external carotid reversed for a large part of the cycle, returning to the roots of that vessel as the entire organ was distended. The organ owes its pulse-filtering behaviour to the resistive effect of the capillary plexus, combined with a reservoir-like storage due to the compliance of the fibroelastic capsule. This function concurs with Ask-Upmark's observation that all mammals have some pulse-filtering device interposed in their cranial arterial supply. I propose this to be the main function of the labyrinth, accounting adequately for its complex vascular structure. Its undoubted chemoreceptor function clearly can coexist happily with this vascular one.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3129</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The epidemiology and management of cerebrovascular disease</field><field name="creator">Beaglehole, Ruth Bonita</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3136</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The epidemiology of pertussis in New Zealand and risk factors for pertussis in New Zealand infants</field><field name="creator">Grant, Cameron Charles</field><field name="description">Literature review Pertussis mortality and morbidity Mass immunisation was associated with a decrease in pertussis mortality and a profound reduction in pertussis incidence. Despite this pertussis remains prevalent. Infants account for the majority of pertussis deaths and hospitalisations. Immunisation Pertussis vaccines protect against disease rather than infection. Despite immunisation pertussis remains endemic. The efficacy of different whole cell and acellular pertussis vaccines varies considerably. There has only been a small increase in immunisation coverage in New Zealand over the past 25 years. Currently between 80% and 90% of New Zealand children receive the primary immunisation series. Other epidemiological features Bordetella pertussis is a highly infectious organism. Neither infection nor immunisation results in lifelong immunity. Pertussis affects all age groups. It is more severe in females than in males. The incidence has always been highest in infants and children but the reported incidence in adults is increasing. Pertussis epidemics occur at four yearly intervals. The epidemic periodicity has not been changed by immunisation. Risk factors for pertussis Contemporary case control studies from the United States have shown that exposure to someone outside of the home with pertussis increases the risk of introduction of pertussis into the home and that infants of adolescent mothers and of mothers with a preceding coughing illness are at increased risk of pertussis. Small sample size and imprecise measurement of immunisation status have compromised these studies. Other factors associated with an increased risk of pertussis in infants include younger age, low birth weight, the infant's immunisation status and household crowding. Prior to this current case control study there was no knowledge on the effect of infant characteristics, infant immunisation status, parental and household characteristics, or socioeconomic factors on the risk of pertussis in infants. Methods The pertussis mortality and hospital discharge statistics and notification data from 1872 to 2000 were reviewed. The characteristics of children hospitalised with pertussis during the 1995 to 1997 epidemic were described. Risk factors for pertussis in infants were determined using a case control study with two different control groups. A matched case-control design was used to compare infants with pertussis with well control infants from the community. An unmatched design was used to compare infants hospitalised with pertussis to infants hospitalised with other acute respiratory illnesses. Results Historical review of pertussis epidemiology Immunisation was associated with a significant decline in pertussis mortality rates in New Zealand. Pertussis incidence rates in New Zealand are five and 10 times higher than in the United Kingdom or the United States. New Zealand pertussis hospital discharge rates increased from 1920 to 1950, decreased from 1950 to 1970 and have been increasing since then. The severity of disease among those hospitalised in New Zealand is comparable to other developed countries. Case control study of risk factors for pertussis in infants In the community control sample factors associated with incomplete immunisation included poverty and household crowding, advice from a doctor that immunisations be delayed and the caregiver not having a record of the infant's immunisations. Primary and secondary pertussis in case households occurred in all age groups. Over half of the primary cases were infants. Factors associated with an increased risk of pertussis included incomplete immunisation of the infant, children five to nine years of age living in the household, household members with pertussis during the preceding two months and the family doctor advising that an immunisation be delayed. Preschool attendance by a household member was associated with a decreased risk of pertussis. Infants of low birth weight and infants with younger mothers were not at increased risk of pertussis. In a multivariate analysis, non-immunisation of other children in the household and the presence of someone in the household with clinical pertussis were associated with an increased risk of pertussis in infants. The associations between household members with cough and the risk of pertussis varied with the age of the household members and imply an age dependent disease modifying effect of immunisation. For many of the children in the study households it seems unlikely that any health professional knew whether or not they were fully immunised. Conclusions Immunisation reduced pertussis mortality in New Zealand. Pertussis hospitalisation rates are increasing despite improvements in the immunisation schedule. Sustained sub-optimal immunisation coverage appears to be the dominant reason for New Zealand&#8217;s excessive pertussis disease burden. Primary school aged children are important in household pertussis transmission.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3130</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Psychosomatic dimensions of chronic musculoskeletal pain</field><field name="creator">Large, Bob, 1945-</field><field name="description">This thesis sets out to explore some psychosomatic dimensions of chronic musculoskeletal pain. Pain is a phenomenon which is universally recognised and experienced but nevertheless presents a very real epistemological problem. For convenience, the philosophical approach chosen here is that of linguistic parallelism which views pain as a range of abstract concepts defined in a variety of &#8216;languages&#8217; or disciplines in a complementary and interactive way. Psychiatric formulations of pain include the concepts of conversion, object relations and the associations of pain with a developmental history of suffering and defeat and a diagnosis of depression. These ideas have been to some extent confirmed by nomothetic studies of pain patients. Chronic, as opposed to acute, pain is associated with a broad range of physical, emotional and social changes and is a problem of such clinical magnitude that special multidisciplinary clinics have now become a feature of clinical services in most large centres. My own experience as a psychiatrist working in the Auckland Pain Clinic is described in this thesis. Over a four year period, 172 patients were assessed, comprising 15-20% of the total referrals to the clinic. The modal age was 45-54 years, with a male/female ratio of 7:10. The duration of pain was 5-10 years, the back being the most common site and musculoskeletal pain was by far the most frequent presentation. Most of the patients presented with psychiatric disorders in the neurotic-personality disorder spectrum; depression, anxiety and hysteria being frequent diagnoses. These findings are similar to other studies reviewed. Treatment was instituted in half of the patients seen and half of the treated patients improved or recovered. One third of the original sample returned a completed follow-up questionnaire 18 months to 5 years after presentation. Just under a half remained improved or recovered, the treated patients faring no better or wrose than those who refused or were not offered treatment, or who were referred elsewhere. There was a high rate of further consultation amongst all groups, but especially so for those who declined treatment. The treated patients and those referred elsewhere were significantly more likely to have found the psychiatric consultation helpful. EMG feedback, drug withdrawal and psychotherapy were more frequently associated with improvement than pharmacotherapy on short-term evaluation. On follow-up only EMG feedback maintained an advantage, Issues which emerged were the relationships between chronic pain, depression and antidepressant medication response; the role of anxiety and tension in chronic pain and the strong tendency towards continued help seeking amongst the majority of patients. Muscle tension has been invoked in the aetiology and maintenance of a variety of pain syndromes. The most intensively researched areas have been tension headache and temporomandibular joint pain where EMG feedback has become an established treatment technique, although there is still some controversy as to whether EMG feedback has any advantage over relaxation training as such. The use of EMG feedback training in other musculoskeletal conditions has been less well researched and doubt remains as to the role of generalised muscle tension in the causation of these conditions. An EMG feedback study was undertaken at the Auckland Pain Clinic using a within-subjects control- design. Eighteen subjects (12 females and 6 males) with neck and back pain were studied in terms of subjective reports of pain and EMG activity measurements under standardised conditions. Three conditions were compared, viz EMG feedback training, a control condition and a waiting list condition. The sequences of presentation of these conditions was counterbalanced in a design using two sets of latin squares to pick up any order effects. EMG feedback was the only treatment which significantly reduced EMG activity across sessions. An order effect was evident in that biofeedback was most effective when presented first but less so when presented after the control condition. Although estimates of present pain correlated with EMG activity, there was no statistical difference between pain score reductions when EMG feedback and control conditions were compared. Pain scores tended to decline during both conditions but the scores for &#8220;worst pain over one week&#8221; tended to rise. During the waiting list condition, present pain tended to increase while &#8220;worst pain over one week&#8221; tended to decline. Eleven subjects experienced an overall decrease in pain scores at the end of the study, while seven had increased pain. Declines in pain scores tended to be associated with a biofeedback training effect but this was not statistically significant. Improvement in pain was associated with high Present pain/EMG correlations when a rank order correlation was computed. This study provides some support for the use of relaxation methods in the management of musculoskeletal pain. It suggests that muscle tension may well play a role in the production and/or maintenance of musculoskeletal pain, although it does not account for all of the variance. The more interpersonal factor of illness behavior may well explain some aspects of pain not accounted for by pathophysiological factors such as muscle tension. Parson&#8217;s notions of the sick role and Mechanic&#8217;s concept of illness behavior have stimulated the by Pilowsky and Spence. We have made use of this questionnaire development of an &#8220;illness behavior questionnaire&#8221;/in a study involving 200 pain patients. A cluster analysis of these results produced profiles very similar to those found in Adelaide and adds validity to the groupings described by pilowsky and spence. Characteristically, patients with chronic pain tend to view their problems in somatic terms and to deny other problems in their lives, or if problems are admitted, to ascribe these problems to their pain. Illness behaviour profiles were found to cut across diagnostic categories when results from patients overlapping between the clinical diagnostic study and the illness behavior study were analysed. These illness attitudes therefore seemed to provide an alternative level of description to diagnostic systems. An analysis of therapeutic outcome in patients undergoing the biofeedback trial did not support the use of illness behaviour profiles as a prediction patients discussed here. Third is the Freudian mechanism of &#8220;conversion&#8221; which may account for pain syndromes where pathophysiological changes are not necessarily evident. These three concepts provide interlinking mechanism between adverse life experiences(with unpleasant affect) and musculoskeletal pain. These are part of an intrapersonal system which is potently influenced by the interpersonal and physical environment of the individual. Illness behaviour is at the social interface between intrapersonal and interpersonal systems. Research directions are suggested which may further elucidate the workings of this proposed psychosomatic formulation of chronic musculoskeletal pain</field><field name="date">1981</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321021 Psychiatry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3131</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Maori face to gambling = Kanohi ki te kanohi</field><field name="creator">Dyall, L. C. T. (Lorna Christine Te Aroha)</field><field name="description">Background Prior to the commencement of this study, gambling was not considered a significant health issue for Maori, even though the first national gambling prevalence study in New Zealand in 1991, identified that Maori had at least three times the risk of problem gambling of non-Maori. In the early 1990s, through the provision of a gambling telephone helpline and gambling counselling services, it was identified that Maori and in particular Maori women, were increasingly seeking help with problems with gambling. Gambling is an integral part of the culture of New Zealand. To understand gambling and problem gambling requires an understanding of the social, economic and cultural context it plays in being Maori. Aim of Study This study investigated whether gambling and problem gambling is an emerging health issue for Maori and if so, the extent of the problem, its effects on Maori and health approaches, and interventions which are likely to be effective for Maori. A public health approach to address problem gambling has been investigated and a plan developed. Methodology This study has been undertaken from a Maori-centered and an action-oriented research approach. It has involved integrating existing and new information from the following sources: Maori patterns of gambling and expenditure, gambling prevalence data, Maori utilisation of gambling treatment services and gambling by indigenous people. Fifteen Maori problem gamblers have been interviewed to understand from the "inside looking out" their experience of problem gambling. Thirty key informants have also been interviewed to understand from the "outside looking in" their perspective as to whether gambling is an emerging health issue for Maori. This research has involved quantitative analysis and qualitative research. Findings This study has found that problem gambling is an emerging public health issue for Maori. The effects of problem gambling for Maori are invisible and masked by other health problems such as alcohol abuse or mental health problems. Maori prevalence of problem gambling is similar to other indigenous populations which have shared similar historical and socio-economic experiences. Problem gambling often leads to crime, imprisonment, development of other health problems and the break down of families. Focusing alone on problem gambling ignores the real issues for Maori, a wider perspective is needed which focuses on Maori and tribal development. A public health strategy is proposed to reduce Maori gambling related harm.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3123</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrophysiological and behavioural measures of central auditory processing in adult cochlear implant users</field><field name="creator">Kelly, Andrea Susan</field><field name="description">This study aimed to determine the relationship between auditory evoked potential measures, speech perception and frequency discrimination in 12 experienced adult cochlear implant (CI) users and to compare the evoked potential results in the CI subjects to those of a group of age- and gender-matched control subjects with normal hearing. The CI subjects all used the Nucleus CI-22 implant with the SPEAK processing strategy. Subject age range was 27-74 years (mean 50.9 years). All had used their implant for a minimum of one year (range 13-76 months, mean duration of implant use 37.5 months).Duration of profound deafness prior to implantation ranged from 1 - 40 years (mean 15.6 years).Middle latency response (MLR), obligatory N1-P2 cortical potentials, mismatch negativity and P3a auditory evoked potential were recorded. Speech perception was evaluated using tests from "The Minimum Speech Test Battery for Adult Cochlear Implant Users". Frequency discrimination was measured using a two-alternative forced choice procedure, to record difference limens (DL) for a 1000Hz tone. Duration of deafness correlated strongly with speech perception scores with poor scores reflecting greater years of deafness. The most sensitive of all the evoked potential measures was P2 latency, with strong relationships found between P2 and duration of deafness and speech perception scores. Earlier P2 latencies were associated with shorter durations of deafness and higher speech perception scores. In general, mismatch negativity was absent or degraded in CI subjects with poor speech scores. In better implant users mismatch negativity was typically present to both large and small frequency differences and demonstrated characteristic changes of increased latency and decreased area and amplitude for the more difficult discrimination task (as seen in the normal hearing group). Na amplitude of the MLR correlated negatively with duration of deafness, with small amplitudes reflecting greater duration of deafness. Frequency DLs were very variable, and no strong relationships were found between these and the evoked potential or speech perception measures.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3126</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of neurotrophic factors in neurodegenerative disorders of the human brain</field><field name="creator">Connor, Bronwen Jane</field><field name="description">Neurotrophic factors are a family of polypeptides that promote the differentiation, growth and survival of numerous central nervous system neurons during development and adulthood. It has been proposed that alterations in neurotrophic factor protein or receptor expression may be involved in the pathogenesis of human neurodegenerative disorders. Recent research supports the therapeutic use of neurotrophic factors in neurodegenerative disorders. However, while information has been obtained regarding the structure and function of neurotrophic factors and their receptors (trk receptors) in the developing and mature rodent central nervous system, little research has been performed examining the expression and functional role of these factors in the normal and diseased human brain. This thesis investigated the role neurotrophic factors and trk receptors play in the pathogenesis of human neurodegenerative disorders. Using immunohistochemical and in situ hybridisation techniques, the regional distribution and cellular localisation of neurotrophic factors and trk receptors was examined throughout both the adult rat and normal human brain. The expression of individual neurotrophic factors and trk receptors was also examined in human post mortem normal, Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease brain tissue, as well as in an animal model of apoptotic nerve cell death. Individual neurotrophic factors exhibited a specific and heterogeneous regional pattern of distribution throughout the adult human brain. Neurotrophic factor expression was detected in several neuronal populations which exhibit selective vulnerability in various neurodegenerative disorders. Alterations in the expression of neurotrophic factors within specific regions of the human brain may result in neuronal atrophy, possibly via apoptotic mechanisms. A significant reduction in the level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was observed within the hippocampus and temporal cortex of the Alzheimer's disease brain. A loss of neuroprotection afforded by BDNF may contribute to the progressive atrophy of neurons in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. The high-affinity trk receptors, trkA and trkB (full-length and truncated) were also altered within the Alzheimer's disease brain. TrkA receptor-immunoreactivity was observed in astrocytes in the CA1 region of the Alzheimer's disease hippocampus, some of which were associated with &#946;-amyloid plaques. Truncated trkB receptors were found in high levels in senile plaques while the full-length trkB receptor was expressed in glial-like cells in the Alzheimer's disease hippocampus. The appearance of trkA and trkB receptors in astrocytes and plaques in the Alzheimer's disease brain might be related to &#946;-amyloid deposition and could be implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Alterations in insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) protein expression were also observed within the Alzheimer's disease brain. IGF-I-immunoreactivity was expressed in a subpopulation of reactive astrocytes in the Alzheimer's disease temporal cortex. These observations may indicate that IGF-I is involved in the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease. The induction of IGF-I in response to neuronal injury may be an attempt to inhibit mechanisms that result in delayed neuronal death. In addition, neurotrophic factor expression was examined in the Huntington's disease brain. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and transforming growth factor-&#945; (TGF-&#945;) were significantly reduced within both the Huntington's disease globus pallidus and substantia nigra. Reduced GDNF and TGF- &#945; levels within the Huntington's disease brain may produce a loss of local or target-derived neurotrophic support within the basal ganglia and contribute to the preferential degeneration of medium-sized spiny projection neurons within the Huntington's disease striatum. Moderate hypoxic-ischemic (Hl) injury was used as an animal model of apoptotic nerve cell death. In agreement with the observations made in the Alzheimer's disease brain, moderate Hl injury resulted in the loss of BDNF within the rat hippocampus. In contrast, an increase in trkB (truncated) receptor expression was detected within glial cells in the rat brain. Alterations in BDNF and trkB receptor levels may lead to a loss of neuroprotection and the initiation of downstream mechanisms resulting in the induction of apoptotic processes. A cascade of events similar to those observed within the rat Hl model may occur within human neurodegenerative disorders. This study demonstrated that, while the neuropathogenesis of both Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease is complex, alterations in individual neurotrophic factor or trk receptor expression within selectively vulnerable cortical or subcortical regions may play a role in their pathophysiology. Furthermore, these results support the proposal that neurotrophic factors may be considered for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders by protecting against neuronal cell loss and by increasing the function of surviving neuronal populations.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320500 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3134</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epidemiology of Giardia infection in New Zealand and the risk in children</field><field name="creator">Hoque, Mohammad Ekramul</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3127</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chamier the Epicurean : the life and works of George Chamier (1842-1915)</field><field name="creator">Sturm, Sean Roderick</field><field name="description">George Chamier (1842-1915) was an engineer and novelist, who was born and died in England, but spent most of his life on an eccentric orbit around the outskirts of the British Empire&#8212;through New Zealand, Australia and China and back to England again. After he had established himself as an engineer in Australia, he looked back on his life in a trilogy of autoethnographical novels, which work through the problem of how an &#8220;unsettled settler&#8221; such as he might get settled in the settler colonies. Philosopher Dick (1890) and A South-Sea Siren (1895) are set in the eighteen-sixties in North Canterbury, New Zealand on a back country station and in a small town respectively; The Story of a Successful Man (1895) is set in the eighteen-seventies in &#8220;Marvellous Melbourne.&#8221; This thesis, &#8220;Chamier the Epicurean,&#8221; examines Chamier&#8217;s life and (fictional) works in the light of two key questions. The first is: How can we understand the distinctive critical perspective on life in the settler colonies in the early days of European settlement that his novels articulate? The &#8220;outside insideness&#8221; of his position as an unsettled settler can account for the critical purchase he has on his own culture. Such a perspective is unusual in the history of local settler literature, not just because it is critical of settler society or &#8220;unsettling,&#8221; but because it is critical in an unusual way: Chamier unsettles himself by problematising his own position as a settler, thereby generating a critical autoethnography&#8212;to borrow Deborah Reed-Danahay&#8217;s definition, a critical &#8220;self (auto) ethnography&#8221; that is also &#8220;the ethnography of [his] own group,&#8221; his own ethnos (people). And the second question that informs this thesis is: How can we understand the relation between his life and works, given the degree to which the former seems to inform the latter? In the novels, he makes sense of his life in hindsight as a sentimental education.

This system setup has the advantage of low cost, &#176;exibility, and less wiring, but it also inevitably invites some delays and data loss into the design procedure. The focus of this thesis is to address the problem of analysis and design of networked control systems when the communication delays are varying in a random fashion. This random feature of the time delays is typical for commercially used networks, such as a DeviceNet (which is a controller area network (CAN)) and Ethernet network. Models for communication network delays are &#175;rst developed, in which Markov processes are used to model these random network-induced delays. Based on such models, we establish novel methodologies for stability analysis, control with disturbance attenuation, and fault estimation for a class of uncertain linear/nonlinear uncertain NCSs with random communication network-induced delays in both sensor-to-controller and controller-to- actuator channels. Data packet dropouts in the communication channels also have been taken into consideration in the modelling and design procedure. The main technique used in this thesis is based on the Lyapunov-Razumikhin method, which results in delay-dependent controllers. We &#175;rst consider the design prob- lems for uncertain linear NCSs. In this case, state feedback controllers and dynamic output feedback controllers are designed to satisfy both stability and disturbance at- tenuation requirements for this class of NCSs. Moreover, a robust fault estimator that ensures the fault estimation error is less than a prescribed performance level is designed. We further go on to address the control problems for uncertain nonlinear NCSs. The nonlinear plant is &#175;rst described by the T-S fuzzy model. Based on this model, stability analysis, disturbance attenuation, and fault estimation problems are studied for uncer- tain nonlinear NCSs. It should be noted that system uncertainties, disturbances and noises are addressed in both cases. The existence of such controllers and fault estimators are given in terms of the solvability of bilinear matrix inequalities. Iterative algorithms are proposed to change this non-convex problem into quasi-convex optimization problems, which can be solved e&#174;ectively by available mathematical tools. Finally, to demonstrate the e&#174;ectiveness and advantages of the proposed design methodologies in this thesis, numerical examples are given in each designed control systems. The simulation results show that the proposed design methodologies can achieve the prescribed performance requirements.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3372</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stochastic modelling of rat invasions among islands in the New Zealand archipelago</field><field name="creator">Miller, Steven Duncan</field><field name="description">This project was formulated with the purpose of advancing knowledge of the invasion dynamics of rats within archipelagos in New Zealand. The concentration on islands reflected the conservation focus of this project - islands are the last refuges for many native New Zealand species that cannot survive in the wild on the mainland. This project can be divided into four areas: 1. Data collection: There was no intent for innovation here, but a deeper understanding of the environments in which rats are born, breed, migrate, and die was developed. 2. Development of tools for data exploration: &#8226; A user-friendly point-and-click graphical interface for the R program was designed to allow any user to easily explore simple genetic characteristics of the data. &#8226; A novel method for exploring the genetic similarity between individuals was developed and showcased with real data, proving successful in cases of both high and low genetic differentiation, and in detecting likely individual migrants. 3. Improvement of a method for estimating migration: &#8226; An attempt was made to improve the Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure underlying this method. &#8226; The migration model used by the method was significantly improved, so that it could cope with any level of migration. Previously, results from situations where migration rates were high were invalid. 4. Investigated topics of ecological interest: &#8226; Field measurements of rats were used to show that Norway rats tend to have larger masses than ship rats, southern rats are generally larger than northern rats, but the effect on mass of living on an island as opposed to the mainland depends on the latitude. It was also shown that relative tail length is a good species discriminator. &#8226; Multiple paternity was confirmed for both Norway and ship rats. This breeding characteristic might form part of the explanation for why rats are such successful invaders. During the project, case studies involving rats on Big South Cape Island, Great Barrier Island and in the Bay of Islands were used to highlight the methods developed, and provided some unexpected and fascinating results.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rattus spp.</field><field name="subject">Island ecology</field><field name="subject">Population genetics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230200 Statistics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3375</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Placing the lived experience(s) of TB in a refugee community in Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lawrence, Jody</field><field name="description">Although rates of tuberculosis (TB) in much of the western world have steadily declined since the Second World War, this infectious disease remains a leading cause of death among those living in impoverished circumstances. Social science perspectives have argued that TB is as much a reflection of socio-economic inequality and the uneven distribution of power and resources as it is about biological processes.  In this thesis I explore the lived experience of TB within the Somali refugee community in Auckland, New Zealand.  While migrants and refugees are frequently blamed for the resurgence in TB in Western countries, very little is known about the determinants that underlie this manifestation of the disease. The present research addresses this gap in the literature by employing a transdisciplinary social science approach that considers the determinants of health and illness that range across the social, cultural economic and political domains of human experience. The geographical underpinnings of the work are borne out in the fundamental goal: to (literally and metaphorically) place the lived experience of health, disease (and particularly TB) within the Somali refugee community in the wider context of migration and resettlement.  Employing qualitative methods I draw upon participants&#8217; narratives to highlight the different ways in which Somali health beliefs and experiences have been shaped by wider structural forces.  I demonstrate that within Auckland, Somalis encounter multiple and overlapping layers of disadvantage.  The combined impacts of this disadvantage have a profound influence on their health and illness experience, particularly in terms of the development and ongoing occurrence of TB.  Respondents with TB recounted widespread stigma that exacerbated the harm incurred by the illness itself.  Although Somalis are highly marginalised, the thesis acknowledges the agency and creativity exerted by people in fashioning the course of their life within the context of considerable structural constraints.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tuberculosis</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">illness</field><field name="subject">migration</field><field name="subject">resettlement</field><field name="subject">Somalis</field><field name="subject">Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3151</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of the mechanical and oxygen barrier properties of microfibril reinforced composites</field><field name="creator">Shields, Ryan John</field><field name="description">A relatively new type of reinforced composite material, derived from immiscible blends of thermoplastic homopolymers, is characterised in this doctoral research.  Microfibril Reinforced Composites (MFCs) utilise common engineering and commodity polymers to create high strength and stiffness microfibrils dispersed in an isotropic matrix.  Unlike traditional polymer composites, MFCs use the dispersed component of a blend to create an even distribution of in situ reinforcing microfibrils via a simple extrusion, drawing and processing technique.  This research quantifies the mechanical and oxygen gas barrier properties of polyolefin-based MFCs containing polyethylene terephthalate (PET) microfibrils.  It is concerned not only with identifying MFCs with the best properties, but also with how manufacturing parameters influence those properties.  Characterisation is split into several parts.  Initial investigations into blend development during extrusion and drawing were conducted.  The main purpose of this was to gain a better understanding of the factors influencing the morphological changes that occur during production.  Blend viscosity ratio and capillary number were identified as key factors in determining the onset of coalescence, deformation and break up of the dispersed polymer.  The effects on microfibril formation of several important manufacturing parameters were highlighted, with die diameter and extrusion speed the most influential of these.  A significant skin-core microstructure was observed.  Formation of elongated microfibres (with negligible molecular chain alignment) was shown to occur during extrusion, which was subsequently justified via modelling of the shear stress flow fields in the die. Drawn blends gave very high tensile strengths and stiffnesses due to highly oriented molecular chains.  A threshold draw ratio of 3.5, at which properties change considerably, was identified.  Mechanical properties of injection moulded MFCs from polypropylene were not considerably better than the neat matrix polymer.  However, those from polyethylene (PE) showed significant improvement via injection moulding and directional compression moulding.  MFCs with just 30% microfibril content displayed tensile properties up to six times greater than neat PE.  Measurements of oxygen gas permeability highlighted improvements of up to 65%.  Processing and cooling conditions were shown to significantly influence permeability via a Taguchi experimental design analysis.  MFC storage containers from PE/PET were injection moulded as proof-of-concept on completion of the research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">polymer</field><field name="subject">composite</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291400 Materials Engineering::291401 Polymers</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291400 Materials Engineering::291402 Composite materials</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3373</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis of mannosylated peptides as components for synthetic vaccines</field><field name="creator">Kowalczyk, Renata</field><field name="description">The immune system often recognises tumour cells and infectious agents from the unique peptides found on their surfaces therefore, synthetic peptides of similar structure can be used as vaccines to stimulate the immune system. Despite the problems associated with proteolysis and delivery to the immune system,  peptide-based vaccines have enormous potential due to their ease of synthesis and purification. The aim of this research was to synthesise ligands for mannose receptors (MRs) that are found on human Antigen Presenting Cells (APCs), for use in synthetic vaccines. Carbohydrate bearing antigens are recognised by MRs which play an important role in binding antigens, migration of dendritic cells (DCs) and interaction of DCs with lymphocytes.  Hence, incorporation of a sugar residue into a peptide chain can be used to enhance antigen presentation. This thesis describes the synthesis of fluorescein labelled O-mannosylated peptides using either manual or microwave assisted solid phase glycopeptide synthesis (SPGS) on pre-loaded WANG resin. The mannosylated peptides thus prepared can be tested for their ability to bind mannose receptors on human APCs in vitro. In order to prepare compounds that could be analysed in biological screens, a fluorescent label (5(6)-carboxyfluorescein) was introduced into the glycopeptides via the N&#945;- or the N&#949;-amino group of the lysine residue. It was found that preparation of the glycopeptide was more facile when the peptide chain was built onto the N&#949; of Lys (label into N&#945;) rather than onto the N&#945; of Lys (label into N&#949;). In order to overcome problems experienced when introducing more than one glycosylated building block into the peptide chain, a polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker was employed as a sugar carrier. It was found that mono- and dimannosylated building blocks attached to PEG carrier were incorporated more easily into the peptide chain compared to mono- and dimannosylated serine units. Importantly, microwave technology (CEM Liberty microwave peptide synthesiser) was used for SPGS which resulted in improved purity and yields of the glycopeptides thus prepared with a significant reduction in reaction times. The first fifteen glycopeptides prepared  in the present study were tested for binding to mannose receptors. Several compounds have shown improved binding to monocytes (bear MRs) in comparison to lymphocytes (do not bear MRs), in the presence of calcium ions. Calcium dependent binding is specific for C type lectin receptor family  that MRs belong to. Five remaining glycopeptides are currently undergoing biological evaluation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">glycopeptides</field><field name="subject">solid phase peptide synthesis</field><field name="subject">glycosylation</field><field name="subject">mannose</field><field name="subject">peptide vaccines</field><field name="subject">microwave</field><field name="subject">mannose receptor</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250300 Organic Chemistry::250301 Organic chemical synthesis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250300 Organic Chemistry::250302 Biological and medical chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3341</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Water wave scattering by floating elastic plates with application to sea-ice</field><field name="creator">Kohout, Alison L.</field><field name="description">This thesis considers the scattering of small amplitude water waves, obliquely incident on a set of floating elastic plates occupying the entire water surface. The problem is twodimensional and assumes invariance in the width of the plates. All non-linear physical effects are neglected. The plates are floating on a body of water of finite depth and each plate has uniquely defined properties. The problem is formulated by imposing boundary conditions on the eigenfunction expansion of Laplace&#8217;s equation. A set of transmission and reflection coefficients is generated, which is solved by applying the edge conditions and matching at each plate boundary. We label this solution method the Matched Eigenfunction Expansion Method (MEEM). The problem is solved for a variety of edge conditions including free, clamped, sliding, springed and hinged. To verify the MEEM results, the problem is also solved using a Green Function Method. The convergence of the two methods is compared and found to be almost identical. The MEEM is used to simulate wave&#8211;ice interaction in the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ). The model removes the resonance effects and predicts that the transmitted energy is independent of floe length, provided the wavelength is more than three times the floe length. The model predicts an exponential decay of wave energy with distance of propagation through the MIZ, which agrees with experimental findings. The results have been summarised in a graph with the attenuation coefficient expressed as a function of period for various floe thicknesses. We also provide an estimate of the attenuation coefficient using an approximation theory. The displacements of the MEEM are compared against a series of laboratory experiments performed in a two-dimensional wave-tank and show good agreement. The attenuation model results are compared against a series of field experiments carried out in the Arctic and off the West Antarctic Peninsula. Generally, the decay rates of the model agree well with the field experiments in diffuse ice. We suggest that factors other than wave scatter are relevant in models of wave-attenuation in non-diffuse ice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3374</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adolescents&#8217; interpretation of smoking imagery in film: implications for future smoking</field><field name="creator">McCool, Judith.</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3157</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Disability following car crashes: an epidemiological investigation</field><field name="creator">Ameratunga, Shanthi Neranjana</field><field name="description">Background Road traffic injury is projected to rank as the third largest contributor to the global burden of disease by 2020. Disability is a significant component of the burden of disease ranking. Most published data on traffic crash outcomes, however, focus primarily on deaths and hospitalisations. Reliable estimates of post-crash disability and information on factors that modify the disabling process are essential to prioritise and allocate appropriate resources for road traffic injury prevention and interventions that reduce the risk of secondary disability. Aims To quantify the risk of disability associated with serious injury crashes in car drivers in a defined population; to explore the extent to which this risk is modified by chronic alcohol abuse; and to critically review methodological approaches that can redress the inadequate epidemiological attention to injury-related disability. Methods Systematic reviews were conducted to examine the available epidemiological evidence quantifying the association of car crashes with disability and the effect of alcohol on the risk of post-injury disability. Studies published or presented between January 1980 and April 2003 were reviewed. No language restriction was imposed. A population-based prospective cohort study conducted in the Auckland region of New Zealand recruited drivers exposed to serious injury crashes (identified through a surveillance system monitoring hospital admissions of injured car occupants). A representative sample of car drivers in the region was identified through roadside surveys (controls). The participants were interviewed at recruitment (to obtain pre-crash information from crash drivers and baseline data from controls) and re-interviewed at five and eighteen-months follow-up. Structured interviews on all three occasions included the Short Form-36, a global health change indicator, and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. Information on a range of potential confounders was sought at baseline through the interview, alcohol measurements and clinical records. Results Studies identified in the systematic reviews revealed that published estimates of the risk of post-crash disability ranged from 2% to 57%. The evidence regarding the effect of alcohol on post-injury disability is inconclusive largely because none examined this association directly. Most studies identified in the reviews were limited by several methodological problems including the absence of appropriate comparison groups, inadequate or no adjustment for confounding, significant potential for selection bias due to the study setting, high levels of loss to follow-up, and missing data. In the prospective cohort study, 215 crash drivers (75% follow-up) and 254 controls (69%) completed the 18-month interview. Overall, 40% of the drivers who were hospitalised, 20% of the crash drivers not hospitalised, and 7% of the controls reported deteriorated health at 18 months relative to their baseline health. This represents a tenfold excess risk of disability among hospitalised drivers and a three-fold excess risk among non-hospitalised crash drivers, relative to drivers in the general population. Among crash drivers reporting an overall decline in health, clinically important reductions in general and mental health were apparent over the follow-up period despite improving physical health and function. This trend was more evident among non-hospitalised than hospitalised crash drivers. Compared with drivers who were neither involved in a crash nor defined as hazardous drinkers, crash drivers who were hazardous drinkers had a seven-fold excess risk of a clinically significant (&#8805; 10%) decline in the SF-36 general health score (OR 6.85; 95% CI: 1.84-25.43). Crash drivers who were not hazardous drinkers had a three-fold risk (OR: 3.00; 95% CI: 1.14-7.89). The results indicated an important interaction between crash involvement and chronic alcohol abuse in potentiating the risk of disability. Conclusion Serious traffic crashes are associated with significant longer-term disability in a substantial proportion of survivors with an apparent worsening of mental health over time. Definitions of disability and estimates of the burden of disability following traffic injury remain highly variable in the published literature and it is timely for the international research community to develop a more systematic and consistent approach to this major and increasing component of the global burden of disease. By addressing the main methodological limitations of previous studies, this study revealed that chronic alcohol abuse potentiates the risk of post-crash disability. The findings suggest that measures for preventing road traffic crashes as well as efforts to identify problem drinkers among crash survivors should be intensified. The thesis highlights the need for robust indicators of non-fatal injury to monitor the impact of road safety programs and large-scale epidemiological studies to investigate the spectrum and determinants of post-injury disability.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3158</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effectiveness of a Maori Noho Marae smoking cessation intervention: utilising a kaupapa Maori methodology</field><field name="creator">Glover, Marewa</field><field name="description">Maori smoking prevalence rates are double those of non-Maori. Despite recent government funded health promotion targeting Maori, this disparity appears to be widening. Smoking prevalence rates for Pakeha New Zealanders continue to fall, whereas Maori smoking prevalence rates remain stable at 50% of all Maori adults over the age of 15. In response to community demand for smoking cessation assistance, some Maori health providers developed a residential intervention based on marae. This study examined the effectiveness of that approach to aiding smoking cessation among Maori. A secondary purpose of the study was to support the development of uniquely Maori approaches to research, by utilising a kaupapa Maori methodology. The literature on kaupapa Maori health research methodology was reviewed. Consequently, Te Whare Tapa Wha, a contemporary Maori paradigm is used as the central organising framework for analysing and understanding both the act of research and smoking behaviour. Two groups of smokers were interviewed, a group undertaking a Noho Marae smoking cessation programme (n=26) and a group of unaided quitters (n=104). Participants were interviewed prior to their quit attempt and again four months later. Nineteen of the unaided quitters were lost to follow-up. Both quantitative and qualitative data was collected. Few significant differences existed between the groups at the first interview. Among participants who completed both interviews, point prevalence at follow-up was 35% for the Noho Marae group versus 14% for the unaided group. The findings support the effectiveness of Noho Marae smoking cessation interventions. Recommendations on how to strengthen New Zealand's tobacco control programme are made. A greater emphasis on delivering to whanau, rather than focusing interventions on individuals, is recommended. Priority is currently given to groups identified as having higher smoking rates. Decline in smoking prevalence may be hastened by identifying and serving the groups most ready to change smoking behaviour. Further research is indicated, for example, to better understand the smoking cessation needs of pregnant Maori women.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3159</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of clinical outcome measures for children with cerebral palsy</field><field name="creator">Mackey, Anna H</field><field name="description">There are a lack of reliable and valid clinical outcome measures to assess the effects of medical interventions in children with cerebral palsy, potentially compromising research and clinical practice in this area. The objective of this thesis was to identify and develop reliable outcome measures that could be used to evaluate the effects of botulinum toxin A in children with cerebral palsy. Six studies were undertaken in both normative and cerebral palsy populations to address this aim. Two studies investigated the reliability and validity of commonly used measures of lower limb function; three-dimensional gait analysis and visual gait assessment. Four studies investigated measures of upper limb function in children with cerebral palsy. An objective three-dimensional measure of upper limb function was developed and used to examine the reliability and validity of additional upper limb measures of muscle tone and arm function and to complete an objective assessment of upper limb botulinum toxin use in this population. The results demonstrated that three-dimensional and visual gait analyses are reliable and valid measures for children with cerebral palsy. For the upper limb this work has resulted in the development of an objective and reliable three-dimensional kinematic measure of upper limb function. A reliability assessment of the modified Tardieu scale found this measure to have poor reliability in detecting dynamic muscle tone in children with cerebral palsy, indicating limited value as a research tool. The results of the pilot study examining upper limb botulinum toxin A use in a group of ten children with hemiplegia, found small functional gains following treatment, as determined by the three-dimensional kinematic measure and Melbourne Assessment. These two measures were found to have moderate agreement in the determination of range of motion during specific upper limb functional tasks. This work has established the reliability and validity of a range of measures appropriate for use in children with cerebral palsy. The use of valid and reliable outcome measures provides a greater understanding of the complexities of cerebral palsy and ultimately will lead to improved outcome and greater treatment opportunities for families and children with cerebral palsy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3160</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A finite element model of myocardial structure: implications for electrical activation in the heart</field><field name="creator">Le Grice, Ian John</field><field name="description">We have developed a mathematical representation of ventricular geometry and myocardial architecture using a three-dimensional finite element model which incorporates new information on the layered organization of cardiac muscle cells in ventricular myocardium. This model has been used to make a detailed and quantitative comparison of cardiac geometry and fibre organization. Extensive geometric measurements were made in dog hearts arrested in diastole and fixed at zero transmural pressure. These measurements included: ventricular epicardial and endocardial surface geometry (25 hearts), muscle fibre orientations (6 hearts), epicardial coronary vessels (24 hearts), and the specialized conduction system (3 hearts). A finite element mesh was fitted to geometric data for each heart and was shown to provide a faithful representation of the ventricular surfaces. RMS fitting errors were: epicardium 0.75 &#177; 0.18 mm, RV endocardium 1.75 &#177; 0.36 mm, and LV endocardium 1.24 &#177; 0.30 mm (with an appropriately refined mesh). Comparison of coronal cross-sections generated from the meshes demonstrated that ventricular shape is very consistent for hearts of similar size. Myocardial fibre fields were fitted to fibre orientation data and compared at matched sites. The fibre fits were shown to be within the range of measurement error. At equivalent sites fibre fields showed consistent regional differences in transmural fibre angle variation. Comparison of the geometric data revealed very similar patterns of both coronary vessel topology and Purkinje fibre distribution. Two further dog hearts were arrested and fixed as outlined above, and ventricular geometry was measured. The ventricular walls were subdivided into radial base-apex segments from which thick (100 &#181;m) sections were cut. Simple digital imaging procedures were used to characterize the macroscopic organization revealed in a) transmural and b) serial tangential thick sections. These studies confirm that ventricular myocardium is a discrete laminar structure rather than a uniformly branching continuum as has previously been believed. In the transmural plane, myocardial sheets run from endocardium to epicardium in a characteristic pattern which varies at different ventricular sites. It has also been shown that the extent of coupling between adjacent myocardial layers varies transmurally with more extensive interconnections between layers in the subepicardial and subendocardial regions than in the midwall. Our finite element model of cardiac anatomy has been extended to incorporate a representation of the laminar organization of ventricular myocardium. The refined model provides a very good representation of our experimental myocardial sheet data (RMS fitting error = 27&#176;). Finally we review the approaches to modelling electrical activity in the heart and demonstrate the use of our model in studies of ventricular activation.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3162</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The gallbladder epithelium in experimental cholelithiasis</field><field name="creator">Lee, Sum Ping</field><field name="description">1. The behaviour of the gallbladder epithelium in three models of experimental cholelithiasis has been studied. The models are : (a) rabbits when fed a lithogenic diet containing 0.75% dihydrocholesterol for 7 days (b) mice when fed a lithogenic diet containing 1% cholesterol and 0.5% cholic acid for 42 days, and (c) guinea pigs when given subcutaneous injections of Lincomycin (60 mg/kg) for 7 days. 2. The morphological changes in the gallbladder epithelium during gallstone formation have been studied with light microscopy and autoradiography. In all three models, there was a marked increase in cell proliferation early in the lithogenic process before stones were formed. Epithelial dysplasia was common. In the mouse and guinea pig, these cellular proliferative and dysplastic changes progressed to metaplasia with new gland formation. 3. The quantitative and qualitative presence of mucus (glycoproteins) in the gallbladder epithelium has been studied by glycoprotein histochemistry of microscopic sections, by scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and by chemical extraction and analysis of the monosaccharide radicles of the soluble glycoproteins. In all three models, a progressive increase in histochemical staining reaction in the epithelial cells was observed and commenced at a time before stones were formed. Results of the electron microscopic studies supported the histochemical study and in addition, demonstrated the presence of increased amounts of mucus droplets in the subapical zones of gallbladder epithelial cells. Extraction and chemical analysis of the soluble glycoproteins showed a quantitative increase in the glycoprotein content of the gallbladder, starting before stones were formed and persisted to when stones had formed. Both the histochemical and the chemical studies failed to demonstrate a qualitative difference in the mucus produced at different stages. 4. Fluid transport across the gallbladder mucosa has been quantitated by an in vitro preparation (Diamond 1964) in the rabbit and the guinea pig models- In both models, there was an increase in the rate of fluid transport detectable before stones were formed, and returned to normal values when stones were formed and after the lithogenic treatment was stopped.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3178</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms of cell death in Alzheimer's disease</field><field name="creator">MacGibbon, Geraldine Anne</field><field name="description">Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, which is characterised clinically by dementia and progressive memory loss, and pathologically by neuronal degeneration, plaques (insoluble &#946;-amyloid (A&#946;) protein) and neurofibrillary lesions (abnormally phosphorylated tau protein). The mechanisms by which cells die in AD remain largely unknown and controversial. There is some evidence to suggest that cell death in AD brains may occur by apoptosis, and that A&#946; might be involved in this process. Apoptosis, a type of cell death characterised by distinct morphological and biochemical features, is often the result of 'programmed cell death' (PCD). Many gene families have been proposed to be involved in the PCD pathway, including the caspase family, inducible transcription factor (ITF) family (including Jun, Fos and Krox genes), and members of the Bcl-2 gene family (including the death promoting gene Bax). It is possible, therefore, that some of these genes may play a role in cell death in AD. The hippocampus is one of the first regions of the brain to be affected in AD, showing cell loss mainly in the CA1-2 pyramidal cell layer. In this thesis, the hippocampus from AD and Control cases has been examined for markers of apoptosis and genes thought to be involved in PCD. In addition, the actions of A&#946;, human amylin (a structurally similar protein to A&#946;) and the A&#946; precursor protein (APP) have been examined in cell culture in an attempt to elucidate their mechanisms of action and relate this to the pathogenesis of AD. AD hippocampi showed increased DNA fragmentation as assessed by TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labelling (TUNEL), but TUNEL-positive cells in AD generally did not exhibit 'typical' apoptotic morphology, and there was no evidence of the oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis. This indicates that 'typical' apoptosis may not be the predominant cell death mechanism in AD. However, there was some evidence of atypical 'broken' nuclei, which may represent a form of apoptosis that presents with a different morphology in aging tissue. This study found no conclusive evidence of increased expression of Fos or Jun family members in the CA1 region of AD hippocampi, however there were increased levels of the putative 'apoptosis-specific protein' and krox24 mRNA in this area which could be related to the cell death. There was no change in Bax expression in the CA1 region of AD brains (although increased Bax expression was observed in this region in a rat hypoxic-ischemia model where the CA1 neurons die by apoptosis). However, there was a decrease in Bax expression in the granule cells of AD hippocampi which could be related to the relative preservation of these cells in AD. Bax and ITF expression was observed in tangles, senile plaques and Hirano bodies in AD hippocampi, which may be related to the formation of these features and/or the pathogenesis of AD. There appeared to be changes in the cellular location of proteins in post-mortem tissue that made determination of ITF levels extremely difficult. In addition, patterns of ITF expression differed when different antisera directed at the same protein were used. These observations indicate that caution must be exercised when studying protein changes in post-mortem tissue. Application of insoluble A&#946; to cultured cells, and overexpression of APP or familial AD-linked APP mutants in cultured cells, did not cause toxicity or alter c-Jun gene expression. However, human amylin was toxic to cultured cells, and had different effects on c-Jun gene expression depending on the cell type. This shows that structurally similar proteins do not always act by a similar mechanism, and that care must be taken when choosing a cell culture system to study disease-related events. The finding that neither insoluble A&#946; nor APP/AD-linked APP mutants caused acute toxicity to cultured cells, coupled with the lack of relationship between TUNEL staining and A&#946; deposits in post-mortem AD tissue, indicates that deposited insoluble A&#946; and/or increased amounts of A&#946; may not represent the toxic event in AD. This thesis provides a detailed investigation of several factors that could be involved in the cell death process in the hippocampus in AD. The results presented find no conclusive evidence for &#8216;classical&#8217; apoptosis and/or increased ITF expression in the hippocampus in AD, but the changes in expression of krox24 mRNA, &#8216;apoptosis-specific protein&#8217; and Bax suggest that programmed cell death may well be a mechanism which is involved in the pathogenesis of AD.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320500 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences::320503 Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3164</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The studies of novel regulators of bone cell function</field><field name="creator">Lin, Jian-Ming</field><field name="description">The current study investigates novel factors in bone cell biology by using both in vitro and in vivo models. The results show that murine receptor activator of nuclear factor-KB ligand (muRANKL) and rat RANKL (rRANKL) stimulated, while human osteoprotegerin (hOPG) inhibited, 45Ca release and [3H]-thymidine incorporation in rat calvarial organ cultures, osteoclastogenesis from mouse bone marrow cultures and bone resorption in rat isolated mature osteoclast assays. Interestingly, truncated rRANKL(246-318) became an antagonist for non-truncated rRANKL in isolated osteoclast assays. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-8a at 25 ng/mL or greater potently stimulated osteoblast proliferation and mildly inhibited osteoblast differentiation. An autocrine mechanism may be involved in the regulation of osteoblasts based on detection of the expression of FGF-8 in these cells. Osteoclastogenesis was significantly reduced by FGF-8a at 0.05&#8212; 25 ng/mL, while the ratio of RANKL/OPG was elevated by this agent. &#945;-melanocyte stimulating hormone (&#945;-MSH) markedly stimulated both osteoblast proliferation (at 10-9 M or greater) and osteoclastogenesis (at 10-8 M or greater) in vitro. The stimulatory effect on osteoclasts was associated with the increased ratio of RANKL/OPG. Systemic administration of &#945;-MSH resulted in a decrease in trabecular volume in tibiae. &#945;-MSH also stimulated canine chondrocyte proliferation, but had no direct interaction with mature osteoclasts. Milk basic fraction (MBF)-1, MBF-2, milk acidic fraction (MAF)-1 and MAF-2 were found to be mitogenic to osteoblasts in vitro. While MAF-1 inhibited and MAF-2 stimulated bone resorption in calvarial cultures, the peptic hydrolysates of the both fractions showed inhibitory effects in this model. Among the individual components identified from the milk fractions, lactoferrin was found to be an interesting novel anabolic factor, potently stimulating osteoblast proliferation at 1-10 &#181;g/mL or greater in both isolated osteoblast and calvarial organ cultures, as well as potently inhibiting osteoclast formation from bone marrow cells via a RANKL/OPG-independent mechanism. In summary, this study has revealed the possibility of the development of a RANKL antagonist through truncation of the molecule. In addition, the osteoblastic and osteoclastic effects of FGF-8a, &#945;-MSH and lactoferrin have been demonstrated for the first time. However, further study is still needed to better understand the mechanisms of their functioning and to evaluate their potential for clinical application.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3181</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The structure, regulation and function of the leukocyte &#946;7 integrins and CG-1</field><field name="creator">Leung, Euphemia Yee Fun</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the structure, regulation and function of the leukocyte &#946;7 integrins and a novel mouse protein termed CG-1. Members of the integrin family of adhesion molecules are involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, and play fundamental roles in diverse biological processes. The &#946;7 integrins (LPAM-1, HML-1 and M290) appear to play a special role in mucosal immunity and inflammation. They bind to cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) including MAdCAM-1, VCAM-1 and fibronectin which are expressed on inflamed endothelia and epithelia, and thereby contribute to the processes of leukocyte emigration and retention. An analysis of the &#946;7 gene promoter was undertaken to understand the regulation of expression of the &#946;7 integrins on different leukocyte subtypes. Primer extension and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) analysis revealed that the start of transcription was confined to nucleotide positions +1 and +4. The 5&#8217; site contains the highly conserved CA motif found at the transcriptional initiation sites of eukaryotic genes. Transient transfection assays revealed that a small 292bp 5&#8217;-flanking region of the &#946;7 gene is responsible for cell-specific transcription. This promoter appears to be very compact with an array of potential and often overlapping cis-elements clustered around the transcription start site. The types of cis-elements in the &#946;7 gene promoter are reminiscent of those found in the transcriptional enhancers of the TCR, CD3, integrin &#945;4 subunit, and integrin Leu-CAM genes, in accord with the predominantly leukocyte-restricted distribution of the &#946;7 integrins in normal cells. However, proximal promoter activity was quite weak, and it is likely that distal enhancer elements are required to drive expression of the &#946;7 gene. The presence of an enhancer region located between nucleotide positions -690 and -397 was detected by both deletion analysis and DNase I hypersensitivity assay using the EL4 cell line. Functional studies of the trans-acting factors which bind the cis-acting elements contained within the &#946;7 promoter will aid in unravelling the signals imparted to leukocytes in blood vessels and in gut-associated lymphoid tissues that regulate M290/HML-1 and LPAM-1 expression. CG-1 is a coiled-coil leukocyte protein that is characterized by having extensive heptad repeats. It is immunologically related to, associated with, or identical to CD100, a cell surface antigen which shares a costimulatory function with integrins. CD100 influences the proliferation and differentiation of immune cells. Complementary DNAs encoding the mouse homologue of CG-1 were obtained by screening various mouse cDNA libraries with a human CG-1 cDNA probe. The deduced amino acid (aa) sequence of mouse CG-1 displays 83% identity with the human homologue, and the coiled-coil regions have been stringently conserved. CG-1 transcripts are expressed in a diverse range of cell lines and tissues, and are not restricted to haematopoietic cells. A complex pattern of insertions and/or deletions within CG-1 RNAs was revealed by comparison of the sequences of various mouse cDNA clones isolated from different cells and tissues. The deduced amino acid sequences of mouse and human CG-1 are similar to the sequence of the chicken cardiac morphogenic protein ES/L30, suggesting that CG-1 and ES/130 are potentially related members of a gene family.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3184</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Superantigens as vaccine delivery vehicles for the generation of cellular immune responses</field><field name="creator">Loh, Mei San</field><field name="description">The constant battle between pathogen and host has led to substantial diversity and adaptability of the host immune system. Pathogens too, have evolved unique mechanisms to evade their hosts. The production of superantigens is one of these mechanisms. Superantigens are potent T cell mitogens that have the unique ability to bind simultaneously to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules and T cell receptors (TCRs). The resulting uncontrolled activation of up to 20% of all T cells and the subsequent cytokine release, can lead to fever, shock and death. Superantigens are not processed intracellularly like conventional antigens but instead bind as intact proteins to MHC class II molecules expressed on the surface of professional antigen presenting cells. On the hypothesis that the unique properties of superantigens may serve useful for vaccine delivery, several bacterial superantigens were selectively mutated at their TCR-binding site with the ultimate goal of creating a safe, non-toxic carrier protein that could target antigen presenting cells by binding to MHC class II. Antigen presenting cells that expressed MHC class II were indeed targeted by the TCR-binding-deficient superantigens. Cellular internalisation of the superantigen into vesicles was observed as early as 30 min. These supcrantigens were also shown to traffic to, and be captured by, the lymph nodes of immunised mice. Using TCR-binding-deficicnt superantigens as vaccine carrier proteins, enhanced antigenicity and immunogenicity of the conjugated MHC class I-restricted peptide antigen. GP33, was observed in a mouse model. In vitro studies revealed up to 200-fold enhancement of antigenicity when GP33 was conjugated to superantigen. Enhanced immunogenicity was also observed in vivo, with conjugates providing protection against Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection after only a single immunisation. These results indicate that modified superantigens are able to safely deliver peptides for cross-presentation, and may serve as a novel mechanism for vaccine delivery.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321020 Pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3161</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conceptualising boys (and) video gaming: "Communities of Practice"?</field><field name="creator">Robertson, Jennifer D.</field><field name="description">The present investigation aimed to apply Wenger&#8217;s (1998) conceptualisation of the &#8216;communities of practice&#8217; concept (being one concept within the broader framework of social learning theory) to video gaming, based on Gee&#8217;s (2003) suggestion that video gaming could be viewed as a &#8216;community of practice&#8217;. In addition, Paechter&#8217;s (2003a) recommendation that masculinities (after Connell, 1995, and inclusive of a Foucaultian notion of knowledge/power relations), could be additionally conceptualised as &#8216;communities of masculinities practice&#8217; was explored in relation to video gaming. The choice of &#8216;communities of practice&#8217; as the unifying concept for this study was favoured due to the application of the concept to a number of New Zealand, Ministry of Education initiatives. The research project aimed to evaluate the usefulness of the &#8216;communities of practice&#8217; concept for application to boys (and) video gaming as a model for how the concept might be applied to a range of education-related social learning environments. A total of 284 Year 9 boys (13-14 years old), from five New Zealand schools were surveyed about their video gaming behaviours and understandings, and further 42 boys from a selection of these same schools took part in &#8216;lessons&#8217; to discuss in detail aspects of their video gaming. Evidence supported that; video gaming in itself cannot be conceptualised as a &#8216;community of practice&#8217; because there is no sense of mutual engagement in a joint enterprise in the playing of video games, (that was, there is no evidence to support the conceptual understanding of &#8216;community&#8217; or &#8216;practice&#8217;); and in addition, that while masculinities can be convincingly conceptualised as &#8216;communities of practice&#8217;, it is only when the activity of video gaming is seen as a resource within the shared repertoire of the &#8216;communities of masculinities practice&#8217;, in which masculinities, both hegemonic and less hegemonic are performed and reproduced, that video gaming can be linked with the &#8216;communities of practice&#8217; concept. The implications of the findings are discussed in relation to where the conceptual and analytical lens offered by the &#8216;communities of practice&#8217; concept, appear to be more applicable to the world of boys and video gaming. Also reiterated is that romanticised notions of &#8216;community&#8217;, applied to the likes of an educational environment but devoid of conceptual foundation, can be little more than rhetoric when not carefully considered and supported by empirical evidence.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3300</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sympathetic neural control of renal blood flow</field><field name="creator">Leonard, Bridget Louise</field><field name="description">Renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) plays an important role in the control of renal hemodynamics and function. It achieves this control by changing the mean levels of activity and/or changing the power of the distinct frequencies that comprise this mean activity. My studies, presented in four parts, investigate how total renal blood flow (RBF) and intrarenal blood flow are controlled by these changes in RSNA. While RSNA and RBF both show oscillations at various frequencies, the functional significance and regulation of these oscillations is not well understood. To establish whether the strength of these oscillations is under differential control I measured the frequency spectrum of RSNA and RBF following volume expansion in conscious rabbits. At least 6 days prior to experiments animals underwent surgery to implant an electrode for recording renal nerve activity and a flow probe for recording RBF. Volume expansion resulted in a 25 &#177; 5% decrease in mean RSNA, paralleled by an increase in RBF. Renal denervated rabbits did not show an increase in RBF with volume expansion. Spectral analysis of the different frequencies in RSNA showed oscillations in RSNA between 0.2 to 0.4 Hz were selectively decreased following volume expansion (14 &#177; 3 to 6&#177;1% of total power in RSNA at &lt; 3Hz). A corresponding decrease in the strength of oscillations in RBF at this frequency was also seen (20 &#177; 6 to 8 &#177; 2%). In contrast the strength of respiratory (0.8 to 2.0 Hz) and cardiac (3 to 6 Hz) related rhythms did not change with volume expansion. These results show that selective changes in the different frequency components of RSNA can occur. While RSNA plays a significant role in the regulation of RBF, little is known about the role renal nerves may play in the control of regional kidney blood flows i.e. cortical and medullary blood flow (CBF and MBF respectively). This is an important question as the control of blood flow to the renal medulla has been shown to be critical in the long-term control of arterial pressure, chiefly through its influence on tubular reabsorption of salt and water. If renal nerves are involved in the control of medullary blood flow then they may also have a role in long-term arterial pressure regulation. My aim was to investigate the role RSNA may have in the regulation of both CBF and MBF. In a series of experiments, using pentobarbitone anaesthetized rabbits, I electrically stimulated the renal nerves whilst simultaneously recording RBF, CBF, and MBF. Three sequences of stimulation were applied, 1) varying the amplitude of stimulation, 2) varying the frequency of stimulation and 3) stimulation with a modulated sinusoidal pattern which allows determination of the frequency response characteristics of each flow. Increasing amplitude or frequency of stimulation progressively decreased all flow variables. RBF and CBF responded similarly, but MBF responded less. For example, 0.5 V stimulation decreased CBF by 20 &#177; 9% but MBF fell by only 4 &#177; 6%. The amplitude of oscillations in all flow variables was progressively reduced as the frequency of sinusoidal stimulation was increased. An increased amplitude of oscillation was observed at 0.12 and 0.32 Hz in MBF, and to a lesser extent RBF, but not CBF. MBF therefore appears to be less sensitive than CBF to the magnitude of RSNA, but more able to respond to these higher frequencies of neural stimulation. These results show that regional renal blood flows may be differentially regulated by RSNA and indicate a role for RSNA in the control of MBF. To further investigate the effects of RSNA on intrarenal blood flow I performed another series of experiments in which I reflexly increased RSNA while simultaneously recording CBF and MBF. I exposed pentobarbitone anesthetized, artificially ventilated rabbits to graded reductions in inspired 02 content. A separate group of animals with denervated kidneys underwent the same protocol. Graded hypoxia (16, 14, 12 and 10% inspired 02) progressively reduced arterial 02 partial pressure and increased RSNA (by 8 &#177; 3, 44 &#177; 25, 62 &#177; 21 and 76 &#177; 37% respectively compared with air) without affecting MAP. This was accompanied by progressive reductions in CBF (by 2 &#177; 1, 5 &#177; 2, 11 &#177; 3 and 14 &#177; 2% respectively) in intact but not denervated rabbits. MBF was unaffected by hypoxia in either group. Thus, reflex increases in RSNA cause renal cortical vasoconstriction, but not at vascular sites regulating MBF. Taken together results from both these studies provide strong evidence that MBF is less sensitive to the vasoconstrictor influence of RSNA than is CBF. However, larger, chronic increases in RSNA, such as occur in heart failure, could be associated with decreases in MBF. This may implicate RSNA in the long-term control of arterial pressure. The 0.3 Hz oscillation in RSNA, and thus MAP, is intermittent in its presence. In a final series of experiments I studied the underlying reasons for the presence or absence of the 0.3 Hz oscillation. Using conscious animals I studied the oscillation under a range of sympathetic stimulants. I was unable to induce an oscillation in MAP at 0.3 Hz and propose reasons for this. To allow further analysis, I performed a second set of experiments in which I induced the oscillation in RBF by electrical stimulation of the aortic depressor nerve. I found that large amplitude oscillations in baroreceptor stimulation were required to induce oscillations in RBF and MAP. I speculate on what this may tell us about the nature of the slow oscillation.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320600 Medical Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3182</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding leukaemogenesis: towards identification of leukaemia enhancers and suppressors through zebrafish genetics</field><field name="creator">Kalev-Zylinska, Maggie Lucy</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3183</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Art education in New Zealand: issues of culture, diversity and difference</field><field name="creator">Smith, Jill (Jill Elizabeth)</field><field name="description">New Zealand is becoming increasingly multicultural and its school population progressively diverse. Ministry of Education policy documents present policy and curriculum direction which acknowledge the value of New Zealand's bicultural identity and multicultural society. These policies impact on the field investigated, secondary school art education. Developed under the influence of neo-liberal political theory, which emphasises economic sustainability rather than principles of social justice, they raise issues of the position and value of art education in the contemporary age of globalisation. Cultural theorists claim that schooling has a responsibility to educate for an equitable democratic society. Multicultural art education theorists argue that art education can make a significant contribution towards democratic practices. Evident in the literature from within New Zealand is critical, theoretical and philosophical debate on the framing of the arts curriculum and its socio-political and cultural contexts. There is no evidence, however, of practical investigation into how secondary school art teachers are interpreting and implementing the visual arts discipline in the arts curriculum or exploring the underlying issues of cultural diversity in an increasingly multiculturalised society. The thesis is underpinned by a critique of interpretations of culture, diversity and difference, an interrogation of pedagogical practices for culturally inclusive art education, and a critical analysis of curriculum policy. The research investigated, through case study fieldwork in secondary schools, the extent to which policy and curriculum directives and art education practice take into account the ethnic diversity and cultural differences of students from diverse cultures living in a contemporary globalised world.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3171</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Insulin-like growth factors in the ischaemic heart</field><field name="creator">Matthews, Kenneth George</field><field name="description">Cardiac muscle has very limited ability to regenerate following injury. Loss of muscle due to myocardial infarction (MI) is therefore compensated for by hypertrophy of the surviving cardiac muscle. Deposition of inflexible scar tissue in the infarct zone leads to subsequent dysfunction of the heart, often culminating in chronic morbidity and eventual death due to heart failure. Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) are members of a family of insulin-related peptides involved in tissue development, repair and replacement. Their involvement in these roles has been clearly demonstrated in skeletal muscle, but remains unclear in cardiac muscle. The aim of this thesis, therefore, was to undertake a comprehensive evaluation of the insulin-like growth factor axis following induced MI in sheep, in order to determine the relationship between time-based changes in the myocardium and insulin-like growth factor levels, and subsequently to determine the therapeutic effect of GH or IGF-I treatment on cardiac function following MI. To achieve the aims of the thesis, a model of MI was developed from the existing cardiology technique of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Using this model, MI was induced in adult ewes by selected coronary artery occlusion under fluoroscopic guidance. Subsequently, the model was further developed into one of stable heart failure, utilising serial microembolisations targeted by echocardiography. Results showed that, in the cardiomyocytes bordering the infarct, IGF-I mRNA, protein and receptor binding increased, whereas IGF-II mRNA and protein levels did not vary, although IGF-II receptor binding increased. Following these findings, IGF-I levels were manipulated by subcutaneous injections of either growth hormone or IGF-I, and by intra-pericardial IGF-I delivery via catheter. Results showed that neither growth hormone nor subcutaneous IGF-I were able to effect an improvement in cardiac function, although there were indications that a longer duration of treatment with subcutaneous IGF-I might have done so. Intra-pericardial IGF-I, however, resulted in a significant and sustained improvement in cardiac function. In conclusion, surviving cardiomyocytes at the infarct border show marked changes in IGF-I localisation, production and specific binding, indicating that IGF-I is directly involved in post-infarct events, possibly in the maintenance of cardiac function by the induction of hypertrophy. Delivery of IGF-I directly into the pericardium results in a significant improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction which is sustained after cessation of treatment. Such a result indicates that IGF-I may have a role as a therapy in the failing heart.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3172</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A mutation in the gene encoding osteoprotegerin causes the severe bone disease Idiopathic Hyperphosphatasia</field><field name="creator">Middleton-Hardie, Catherine</field><field name="description">Genetic analysis of a large family with Familial Idiopathic Hyperphosphatasia, a rare autosomal recessive bone disease, identified linkage to a region of chromosome 8q that contains the gene for osteoprotegerin (OPG), a key regulator of bone remodelling. Sequencing of this gene in members of the family identified an in-frame 3 base pair deletion resulting in the deletion of an aspartate residue at position 182, within the critical TNF-receptor-like region. Wild-type and mutant OPG cDNA were cloned into pcDNA3.1(-)/myc-His vector and expressed in HEK293 cells. Conditioned media samples containing the recombinant proteins were tested for their ability to inhibit bone resorption in a neonatal murine calvarial organ culture. Conditioned medium containing wild type OPG (wtOPG) inhibited bone resorption, whereas the conditioned medium containing the mutant protein (OPG&#8710;D182) had no effect. Subsequently, the peptides were tested in a murine bone marrow osteoclastogenesis system. In this assay, OPG&#8710;D182 had significantly lower activity than wtOPG. These results indicate the deletion of aspartate 182 impairs the ability of OPG to inhibit osteoclast formation and activation. The ability of wtOPG and OPG&#8710;D182 to bind RANKL has been investigated using a rRANKL-GST pulldown system. These experiments demonstrated the OPG&#8710;D182 had reduced ability to bind RANKL compared to wtOPG. A kinetic study using the surface plasmon resonance technology of BIAcore&#8482; revealed the RANKL binding affinity of OPG&#8710;D182 is lower than that of wtOPG. Altered processing of OPG&#8710;D182 causes hyperglycosylation in comparison to wtOPG. Glycosylation was shown to be important for the function of full-length OPG, probably due to a requirement of glycosylation for correct folding. Site-directed mutagenesis identified two glycosylation sites that contribute to the hyperglycosylation of OPG&#8710;D182. Glycosylation at one of these sites has potential structural implications by preventing disulphide bond formation and correct protein domain folding. The research highlights the effects of a single amino acid deletion on the structure and function of OPG. The deletion of aspartate 182 is a detrimental mutation that results in the severe phenotype seen in the patients, confirming the crucial role of OPG in normal bone physiology in humans.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3173</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of ryanodine receptor expression in the rat cochlea</field><field name="creator">Morton-Jones, Rachel</field><field name="description">Increases in intracellular Ca2+ play a central role in cochlear function. The ryanodine receptor (RyR) intracellular Ca2+ release channel, a ubiquitous element of Ca2+ signalling, has been implicated in the regulation of sound transduction and auditory neurotransmission. Despite this, the molecular basis underlying RyR-mediated Ca2+ signalling in the cochlea has been limited. This thesis investigates the molecular and functional characterisation of RyR expression in the cochlea. RT-PCR analysis showed expression of RyR1, RyR2 and RyR3 isoform mRNA transcripts in the rat cochlea and also in the spiral ganglion. Localisation of RyR protein revealed differential expression of these isoforms in the cochlea. Strong RyR immunolabelling for RyR1, RyR2 and RyR3 were detected in the spiral ganglion neuron (SGN) cell bodies. RyR3 labelling extended to the synaptic terminals innervating the inner and outer hair cells. RyR2 expression also occurred in the inner hair cells and supporting cells of the organ of Corti. Cells associated with ion homeostasis in the cochlea were also labelled, including RyR1 in spiral limbus interdental cells, and RyR2 and RyR3 in spiral prominence epithelial cells and stria vascularis basal cells. In the SGN cell bodies, confocal imaging of Ca2+ store release confirmed the presence of a functional RyR-gated Ca2+ store. Superfusion of glutamate and &#945;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) evoked large Ca2+ responses in the SGN cell bodies that were dependent upon Ca2+ entry. However, subsequent depletion of SGN RyR-gated Ca2+ stores substantially reduced the glutamate- and AMPA-induced Ca2+ responses, demonstrating that the majority of the Ca2+ signal derived from RyR-gated Ca2+ stores via Ca2+ -induced Ca2+ release. Involvement of the AMPA/Kainate-type glutamate receptor was confirmed by elimination of glutamate- and AMPA-induced Ca2+ responses with an AMPA/Kainate receptor antagonist. These findings support a role for RyR in the regulation of auditory neurotransmission, sound transduction and cochlear electrochemical homeostasis. These data also demonstrate coupling between somatic AMPA-type glutamate receptors and RyR-gated Ca2+ stores, which is likely to influence auditory neurotransmission.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320600 Medical Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3186</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pathophysiology of fetal asphyxia: factors that influence the severity and distribution of neuronal damage</field><field name="creator">Mallard, Eva Carina</field><field name="description">Perinatal asphyxia is thought to be a major cause of subsequent neurological deficits. Pathological studies suggest that many of these events occur before birth. However, the relationship between specific prenatal events and neurological outcome is not clear. This thesis tested the hypothesis that certain fetal factors play a role in determining the severity and distribution of neuronal loss following in utero asphyxia. Chronically instrumented fetal sheep at three different gestational ages; midgestation (90d), late-gestation (120-130d) or near term (&gt; 135d) were subjected to either a single or repeated insult. The insult consisted of an episode of either systemic asphyxia (umbilical cord occlusion) or cerebral ischaemia (carotid artery occlusion). The fetal parietal cortical electroencephalogram (EEG), cortical impedance (CI) indicating intracellular edema, blood pressure (MAP), electrocardiogram (ECG) and frequent fetal blood gases and metabolites were measured. Three days after the insult, histopathological analysis or immunohistochemistry was performed to determine neuronal loss and specific neurotransmitters respectively. Transient (10min) occlusion of the umbilical cord in late-gestation fetuses, resulted in severe fetal asphyxia, hypotension (24&#177;5mmHg, p&lt;0.01), bradycardia (72&#177;14bpm, p&lt;0.001), depressed EEG activity (-17&#177;2dB, p&lt;0.001) and intracellular edema. The intracellular edema resolved within 27&#177;6min, whereas the EEG activity was depressed for 5&#177;2h, despite rapid recovery of pO2. Neither seizures or infarction were observed. The degree of hypotension, increase in CI, lactate and recovery of post-asphyxial EEG intensity were more marked in 135d fetuses compared with the midgestation fetus (p&lt;0.01). Neuronal loss, which was only observed in the older group, was predominantly in the hippocampus and associated with the severity of hypotension during occlusion. Repeated episodes of cerebral ischaemia, altered the distribution of neuronal loss compared with single insults, inducing damage mainly in the striatum. The frequency of the insults determined the severity of the damage. Similarly, recurrent episodes of fetal asphyxia induced predominantly striatal neuronal loss. Each occlusion resulted in fetal hypoxia and bradycardia accompanied by increased T/QRS ratio as noted on the ECG. Progressively severe hypotension and lactic acidosis developed during successive occlusions. The EEG was depressed and CI increased with each occlusion. After the asphyxial episodes, blood pressure and heart rate returned to normal, while the T wave was inverted for 310&#177;60min. The EEG remained depressed for 90&#177;10min and intermittent seizures developed at 3.3&#177;0.6h after the last occlusion. The extent of neuronal loss correlated with the degree of hypotension, increase in T/QRS ratio, duration of post-asphyxial EEG depression and number of seizures. Immunohistochemical analysis showed loss of striatal GABAergic projection neurons. These findings demonstrate that certain prenatal factors, such as neurological maturation, pattern of the insult and cardiovascular instability can influence neuronal outcome following fetal asphyxia. An isolated brief episode of asphyxia can lead to selective hippocampal neuronal loss, while repeated insults induce predominantly striatal damage. These distributions of neuronal loss may be associated with postnatal sequelae such as learning disorders and cerebral palsy.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3174</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemoprevention studies with Pacific foodstuffs: effects on xenobiotic metabolising enzymes and cytotoxicity</field><field name="creator">McPherson, Rachel A. C.</field><field name="description">The aims of this thesis were to examine:(1) the effects of acute and chronic dietary exposure of the pro-carcinogen, IQ on the expression and activity of xenobiotic metabolising enzymes; (2) the ability of foodstuffs chronically (individually and in combination with the dietary pro-carcinogen IQ) to alter the xenobiotic metabolising enzymes; (3) whether tissue-specific effects of the foodstuffs on XME could explain pathological results; and (4) whether any isolated fraction of the foodstuffs acted directly as a toxicant or stimulated cell growth in vitro. For the chronic study, male Fischer 344 rats were fed defined AIN-76A diet &#177; 10% foodstuff (taro, kumara, pineapple, or coconut), with or without IQ (300ppm for 52 weeks). In the acute study, male Fischer 344 rats were fed defined AIN-76A diet and gavaged with IQ (20 mg.kg-1, 3 days). Pathology was observed and changes in enzyme activities and expression examined. Simple fractionation of the foodstuffs was also performed and their effects on cell viability and enzyme expression were investigated in vitro in freshly isolated rat hepatocytes and immortal human HT29 and P388 cells. In the liver, acute exposure to IQ affected enzymes consistent with complex xenobiotic response element / glucocorticoid response element activation, whereas chronic exposure was consistent with activation of the antioxidant response element. No pattern of enzyme change was obvious in other organs. Inclusion of South Pacific foodstuffs in the diet at 10% had a marked effect on enzyme activity in the liver and lung, although there was no consistent pattern for enzyme changes for a particular enzyme or foodstuff. Enzyme activity in the colon was below the level of detection. There was a complex response when IQ was included with the foodstuffs, which did not resemble the response to either IQ or the foodstuff alone. Fractionation of foodstuffs and in vitro cell-based work did not reveal the presence of compounds in the foodstuffs that explained the complex changes in pathology or XME observed in vivo. The interaction between foodstuffs and IQ in the body was complicated. This may be explained by the presence of many compounds within the foodstuffs that have additive, synergistic, or inhibitory actions on many pathways in the body and underlines the complexity of using whole foodstuffs, rather than a single, purified constituent, in chemoprevention studies.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320500 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3185</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceptions of coercion of patients subject to the New Zealand Mental Health (Compulsory Assessment and Treatment) Act 1992</field><field name="creator">McKenna, Brian G.</field><field name="description">The use of mental health legislation to determine involuntary treatment for people suffering from mental illness (civil commitment) is a controversial issue, centred on the ability of civil commitment to be coercive by limiting patients&#8217; choice, autonomy and self-determination The intent of the New Zealand Mental Health (Compulsory Assessment and Treatment) Act 1992 was to limit coercion by emphasising informed consent (even if treatment can be administered without it); recognising the civil rights of patients subject to civil commitment; and encouraging involuntary treatment in the least restrictive environment (the community). However, there is no evaluative research that considers the extent to which patients subjected to the legislation perceive coercion. The aim of this thesis was to consider the extent to which mental health legal status equates with coercion, the factors that impact on patients&#8217; perceptions of coercion and the factors that have the potential to ameliorate such perceptions. Empirical cross-sectional comparison studies, measuring perceived coercion using a validated psychometric measure, were undertaken at three points during the implementation of civil commitment. These involved a comparison between involuntary and voluntary patients admitted to acute inpatient psychiatric services, a comparison between involuntary patients admitted to acute psychiatric inpatient services and involuntary patients admitted to forensic psychiatric services, and a comparison between involuntary and voluntary outpatients. The studies found that legal status is only a broad index of the amount of coercion perceived by patients. Some voluntary patients feel coerced and some involuntary patients found the process non-coercive. Perceptions of coercion cannot be fully explained by socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, or by coercive incidents that occur throughout the process of civil commitment. Rather, the perceptions relate to the total experience of civil commitment, including the interactive processes with clinicians. In this regard, involving patients in proceedings that are experienced as fair and just (procedural justice) has a marked impact on reducing patients&#8217; perceptions of coercion. In conclusion, the findings are underscored by legal requirements and ethics in order to provide clinical guidelines for implementing civil commitment.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321021 Psychiatry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3187</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of insulin-like growth factors in the fetus</field><field name="creator">Oliver, Mark Hope</field><field name="description">Fetal substrate supply is important in the regulation of fetal growth. The insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), insulin and placental lactogen (PL) may be important mediators in fetal growth regulation. However, nutritional regulation of circulating concentrations of IGFs, their binding proteins (IGFBPs) and PL during fetal life is poorly understood. The objective of this thesis is to characterise the influence of nutrition on the regulation of these hormones in the fetal circulation. Pregnant ewes were starved for 72 h and then refed for 48 h. After 48 h starvation fetuses were infused with glucose, amino acids or insulin while maternal starvation continued. Other fetuses of fed mothers were infused with recombinant oPL or IGF-I for 24 h. Fetal blood glucose, plasma IGF-I, IGF-II and insulin concentrations all fell on maternal starvation. Fetal plasma IGF-I and insulin concentrations returned to near control values on fetal infusion of glucose or insulin but not amino acids suggesting glucose had a more important role than amino acids in plasma IGF-I regulation and that insulin may have mediated the effect of glucose. Fetal plasma IGF-II concentrations returned to control values on fetal infusion of glucose, but not insulin. Thus fetal plasma IGF-I and IGF-II concentrations appear to be regulated differently by fetal glucose and insulin. Fetal plasma IGFBP-1 and Bp-2 levels increased, while fetal plasma IGFBP-3 and type 2 receptor levels decreased, on maternal starvation. Fetal infusion of glucose or insulin returned fetal plasma IGFBP-1 to near control levels. All fetal plasma IGFBPs were near control levels after maternal refeeding. Fetal plasma IGFBPs and type 2 IGF receptor levels were influenced by nutrition but IGFBP-2, Bp-3 and the circulating type 2 IGF receptor appear to be at least partly regulated by factors other than glucose and insulin. In a separate experiment fetal plasma IGF-I concentrations increased on IGF-I infusion to fetuses whose mothers were on a low plane of nutrition but did not increase in fetuses whose mothers were on a high plane of nutrition suggesting that increases in fetal plasma IGFBP concentrations on maternal starvation or undernutrition may increase fetal plasma IGF-carrying capacity. Plasma concentrations of PL in fetuses whose mothers had been on a high plane of nutrition was higher during starvation than in fetuses whose mothers had been on a low plane of nutrition. Fetal plasma PL concentrations increased 3-fold on maternal infusion of glucose at the end of starvation but was unaffected by fetal infusion of glucose at a lower rate. Fetal plasma PL responses to starvation were influenced by prior nutritional status. The rate of glucose infusion appears to determine the occurrence of a fetal plasma PL response. Fetal blood amino acid nitrogen (AN) concentrations fell on fetal infusion of oPL but fetal blood glucose, plasma IGF-I, IGF-II and insulin concentrations were unaffected. PL does not appear to have a role in the endocrine regulation of the IGFs in fetal sheep but may influence fetal amino acid metabolism. In these studies the fetal plasma concentrations of the IGFs, insulin, PL and plasma levels of IGFBP-1 to -4 have been demonstrated to be regulated by fetal substrate supply. These experiments provide further evidence that these hormones may be mediators in the regulation of fetal growth by fetal substrate supply.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3188</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of nuclear lipid signalling in adipocyte differentiation</field><field name="creator">O'Carroll, Simon J. (Simon Joseph)</field><field name="description">The differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes is one of the most intensely studied biological processes and has led to the understanding of a number of signaling pathways involved in cell growth and differentiation. The nuclear phosphatidyl inositol (pl) signalling pathway, centred around the enzyme phospholipase C (PLC) &#946;I has been demonstrated to be involved in a number of cellular processes such as mitogenesis and differentiation. Recently components of another lipid signalling pathway, that involving prostaglandins, have also been shown to localise at or within the nucleus. To date, there have been no reports demonstrating the role of either of these nuclear pathways during the differentiation of adipocytes. The 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line was used to study the role of nuclear pI and prostaglandin lipid signalling in adipocyte differentiation. In Chapter 3 data is presented to show that two phases of nuclear PLC &#946;l activity occur during adipocyte differentiation. The first phase occurs within minutes of differentiation being induced, is regulated by the actions of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) l/2 and protein kinase c (pKC) &#945;, and is involved in the mitotic clonal expansion phase of differentiation. The second phase of activity occurs from day 2 of differentiation, is regulated independently of ERK 1/2 and pKC &#945; and is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle factors cyclin D3 and cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) 4. In Chapter 4 I investigate the nuclear localisation of prostaglandin synthases, how their localisation is altered by differentiation, and the role of these enzymes in adipocyte differentiation is characterized through inhibitor studies. Cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) cyclooxygenase (COX) 1 and 2, microsomal prostaglandin E2 synthase (mPGES), prostacyclin synthase (PGIS), lipocalin prostaglandin D2 synthase (L-PGDS) are localised to the nuclear membrane and their localisation changes during differentiation. The COX 1 and2 enzymes also localise within the nucleus and this COX 1 localisation appears to be cell cycle dependent. COX 2 is functionally coupled to mPGES and PGIS and plays a role in adipocyte differentiation as inhibition of COX 2 with a specific inhibitor (NS 398) completely blocks adipocyte differentiation. COX 1 is functionally coupled with L-PGDS and appears to be involved in lipid metabolism as the inhibition of COX 1 with a specific inhinitor (SC 560) partially blocks lipogenesis. In Chapter 5, I investigate the localisation of prostaglandin receptors in the differentiation process. 3T3- L1 cells express the prostaglandin E2 (EP4) receptor, prostaglandin F2&#945; (FP) receptor and the prostaglandin D2 (DP) receptor but these do not have a nuclear localisation. Activation of the DP receptor is involved in lipid metabolism as the DP receptor antagonist, BW A868C, partially inhibits lipogenesis. lnternalisation of prostaglandins appears to be necessary for differentiation to occur fully as treatment of differentiating 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with the anionic transport inhibitor bromocresol green (BCG) partially inhibits carbaprostacyclin (cPGI2) induced differentiation and completely inhibits that caused by cyclopentenone prostaglandins. Thus, nuclear lipid signalling pathways appear to play a role in the process of adipocyte differentiation and a proper understanding of these pathways may lead to a better understanding of fat cell development and the role it plays in obesity and its related diseases.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3189</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Screening and clinical detection of alcohol disorder in general practice</field><field name="creator">McMenamin, John</field><field name="description">Aim: This thesis reports on the implementation of key alcohol research findings to the screening and clinical detection of alcohol risk and disorder in a general practice. it aims to provide a literature review which will explain the nature of alcohol risk and disorder, why alcohol screening is necessary, and how this screening could be undertaken in general practice using a model of screening by healthcheck. Alcohol risk is presented as the likelihood of an individual to develop alcohol-related complications. Definitions of alcohol disorder are discussed and the reasons for adopting the DSM111R criteria explained. A study is reported in which healthcheck screening is used to improve detection of alcohol risk and disorder in the author&#8217;s general practice. Selected cases are presented to highlight particular issues relevant to alcohol in general practice. The study findings are discussed with reference to the literature review and recommendations on the use of the healthcheck Screening model in general practice presented. Method: All English language medical journals reporting alcohol-related research were identified by contents review (specialist alcohol and New Zealand journals), medline search (using keywords and related articles/author-specific searching) or cross.referencing from other reports. other alcohol-related professional reports were identified from library searches or obtained from original sources. From the literature review, a format was developed for the healthcheck questionnaire which included a brief alcohol screen. This brief questionnaire included three questions on consumption of alcohol, and two questions identifying concern about alcohol use, modified from screening questionnaires available at the start of the study, particularly the Canterbury Alcohotism Screening Test (CAST) and the Self-Administered Alcoholism Screening Test (SAAST). Adult patients registered with the practice were offered a personal invitation by the doctor to attend a healthcheck appointment. Recruitment was undertaken over a 3 year period for 30-69 year olds (754 eligible patients), and a 5 year period for 18-29 year olds (339 eligible patients). Patients attending the healthcheck completed a self-administered questionnaire which was reviewed by the practice nurse, selected examination items performed, and the results were discussed with the patient by the doctor. Alcohol risk was assessed and laboratory tests arranged if appropriate with follow-up appointment offered to those requiring further alcohol assessment. Patients were classified at increased risk by reported consumption, and diagnosed with alcohol disorder by DSM111R criteria (alcohol abuse or dependence). At the completion of each study period, the clinical notes of all patients in the study were reviewed to determine the screening rate and to review all recorded alcohol information including clinical indicators of alcohol disorder, alcohol risk for all screened patients, and the effect of screening on the prevalence of alcohol disorder. Results: Alcohol information was obtained on 851 of 1093 study patients (78%). Screening increased the detection of alcohol disorder from 4% (44 patients) to 8% (84 patients). clinical detection of alcohol disorder was associated with physical, psychological and social factors. Clinical factors most commonly included abnormal liver function tests, gastro-intestinal symptoms, hypertension, gout and mental health symptoms. Personal and relationship problems were also commonly linked to detection in a clinical context. Recruitment for healthchecks was highest among women (78%) with a high level of screening in both 18-29 year old (80%) and 30-69 year old groups(76%). Recruitment of men (70%) was notably more successful in the 30-69 year old group (85%) than in the 18-29 year old group (44%).As a test for DSM111R alcohol use disOrder, the brief alcohol questionnaire included in the healthcheck had a sensitivity of 0.93, a specificity of 0.85, a positive predictive value of 0.25, and a negative predictive value of 0.99. The questions on alcohol consumption were the most sensitive items, identifying increased risk (intermediate or high risk consumption) in 86% of patients with alcohol disorder. The remaining patients were identified by abnormal liver function tests. A positive screening test (consumption male&gt;20, female &gt;15 standard drinks/week) indicated a 1 in 4 likelihood of alcohol disorder, increasing to 1 in 2 if concern was reported on a screening question, or a liver function tests was abnormal. The healthcheck screening programme increased the detected prevalence of alcohol disorder from 4% to 8%. DSM111R criteria identified 32 patients with alcohol dependence and 52 patients with alcohol abuse. lcDl0 criteria identified 16 patients with alcohol dependence and 54 with harmful use. Nearly half of the patients meeting DSM criteria for disorder (48%) were not drinking at high risk levels (consumption male &gt;50, female&gt;35 standard drinks/week). Case examples drawn from the clinical notes indicated that alcohol information may come from multiple sources, and that classification of this information may be difficult, influenced not only by the completeness of the data available but also by medical interventions and other influences on patient alcohol use over time. Classification was also more difficult in some patients due to the complexity of the particular case. There were advantages identified in classifying disorder including enhanced therapeutic options, increased awareness of related issues and completeness of medical problem lists, although interventions in both risk and disorder were possible without formal diagnosis. Conclusion: there is good evidence in the literature supporting the value of general practice screening for alcohol risk and disorder. This type of screening meets accepted criteria. The importance of alcohol as a health problem is supported by both the prevalence of alcohol-related problems in New Zealand, and the relationship between alcohol and morbidity and mortality. lt is possible to recognise a latent or early symptomatic phase (risk or early abuse/dependence) and it proved possible in the study to collect this information on most patients using the healthcheck screen. There is evidence supporting the value of intervention in heavy drinking and it is reasonable to conclude that intervention in a pre-symptomatic or early symptomatic phase is of more value than waiting until more severe disorder is established. There are good screening tests available including consumption measures, patient questionnaires and laboratory tests. These are relatively inexpensive, generally easy to deliver, and provide sufficient information to determine which patients require further assessment of alcohol use. The use of the brief alcohol screening questionnaire as part of the healthcheck screen proved acceptable to patients in the study and was effective at detecting a high proportion of patients with alcohol disorder. The literature suggests that the AUDIT questions have advantages as screening questions given its international acceptability and its use in several general practice-based New Zealand studies. Although the AUDIT was not available at the time the practice study commenced, it could be incorporated in the health check questionnaire. Laboratory screening has an established supportive role, particularly the selected use of liver function tests. The role of other laboratory tests including carbohydrate-deficient transferring remains unclear and general practice research is required to determine if it has a place in screening and in which patient groups. positive screening tests require further assessment. As indicated in the case examples, this assessment may be undertaken gradually as patients attend the surgery. However, there is benefit if the assessment can be completed more fully. An alcohol assessment package for general practice would be useful. The involvement of practice nurses was essential to the successful delivery of healthcheck screening and this role could be further developed. The practice study shows it was possible to implement evidence-based alcohol screening in a general practice. The healthcheck screening model was a successful method of providing screening though recruitment of younger men could be improved. Uptake of healthcheck screening by other New Zealand general practices would require attention to the organisational factors shown to limit screening and preventive health care delivery.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3190</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Myocyte injury and altered vascular function in developing myocardial infarcts</field><field name="creator">Sage, Martin David</field><field name="description">The temporal and spatial relationships between altered vascular function and cardiac muscle cell injury at the margins of developing myocardial infarcts were investigated, because such knowledge might provide potential for intervention in the evolution of myocardial infarcts and limitation of their size. Regional myocardial ischaemia was modelled in isolated rabbit hearts subjected to ligation of the ventral interventricular branch of the left coronary artery (0,30,60,120 or 240 minutes duration), the remainder of the heart being continuously perfused with oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit buffer solution. After the experimental ischaemic period, the whole heart was fixed by perfusion with phosphate-buffered 2.5% glutaraldehyde which, in preliminary studies, was shown not only to preserve the morphological appearance of cardiac muscle cells, but also to stabilise the distribution of flow through the myocardial blood vessels in the pattern pertaining immediately prior to fixation. Polymerising acrylic resin (L.R. White) was then injected into the vessels of the ischaemic and non-ischaemic regions simultaneously at identical pressures. Resin injected into the ischaemic region contained lead dioxide whilst that injected into the other vessels contained Fat Red 7B dye to allow identification of the source of supply of blood vessels within the heart. Cryofracture, freeze-drying and imaging by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with a backscattered electron detector and low vacuum specimen chamber conditions were used. This made possible examination of transmural segments of myocardium spanning the margins of the ischaemic and control ventricular myocardium containing blood vessels filled by resin. SEM showed severe injury of cardiac muscle cells after 60 minutes of ischaemia, as characterised by separation and swelling of some organelles. Earlier ischaemic changes in some cells (focal increase in prominence of t-tubules and sarcoplasmic reticulum) were seen after 30 minutes. There was a transmural progression in development of irreversible injury from the subendocardium to the epicardium between 60 and 120 minutes corresponding to the "wavefront phenonenon". The lateral margins did not show such marked progression and were typically sharply demarcated on a cell-to-cell basis after 60 minutes. An increase in the proportion of functional capillary pathways (from 55% to 85%) in early (30 minutes) ischaemia was succeeded by a profound perfusion defect, corresponding to the "no-reflow" phenomenon, which had a very close temporal and spatial association with severe injury of cardiac muscle cells. Loss of patency was associated with increased proportions of collapsed, compressed capillaries and swollen myocardial cells. This study demonstrated that there is a significant region of myocardium which for a period shows intermediate degrees of myocyte injury (and is thus potentially salvageable) in the subepicardial portion of the developing infarct. Contrary to the claims of various authors similar potentially salvageable lateral "border zones" were neither large nor non-existent. Within 150 microns of the typically abrupt boundary, small discontinuous areas (&lt;20% of this region) showed intermediate degrees of injury, and there was also an increased proportion of non-functional capillaries which were not collapsed or compressed, resulting in a 'low-flow' zone. This narrow lateral zone requires further investigation to determine whether it is static, and thus of negligible size, or whether it moves in advance of infarction and is thus pathogenetically significant.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321020 Pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3227</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Induction experts: An analysis of beginning teacher support in low-socioeconomic New Zealand primary schools</field><field name="creator">Main, Andrea Squirrel</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses induction programmes in low-socioeconomic New Zealand primary schools. A review of the literature indicates that effective induction is integrated and has four main components: pedagogical development, socioemotional support, professional agency, and structured balance. In addition, New Zealand&#8217;s induction programmes are reported to be strong by international standards. Literature is synthesised to create a framework of low-socioeconomic schools as induction experts. Although there have been large-scale analyses of New Zealand induction programmes, there has been no research on the integrated induction systems found in low-socioeconomic primary schools. A mixed-methods approach was used to investigate the support provided for beginning teachers (BTs) in these schools. Methods included a nationwide survey of BTs in low-socioeconomic primary schools, which was mailed to 467 primary and intermediate BTs (44% response rate). Additionally, from all 156 low-socioeconomic primary schools, five exemplar induction programmes were selected and visited throughout the 2007 school year. Survey analysis, success case methods, discourse analysis, and grounded theory methods indicated that induction in these schools is integrated and strong by international standards. Findings indicate that induction programmes in low-socioeconomic schools are pedagogical, supportive, and well structured; however, not all schools focus on enhancing the professional agency of teachers. Exemplar practices such as peer coaching, university partnerships, on-site BT support groups, curricular leadership roles, and formal programme evaluations were found at case study sites. Analyses of factor themes, cluster graphs, frequency-utility matrices, documents, events, and transcripts of meetings and interviews reveal several key findings. First, the Hauora model&#8212;a M&#228;ori concept of balanced pedagogical, spiritual, socioemotional, and physical development&#8212;may be applicable to induction in the New Zealand setting. Second, analyses indicate that low-socioeconomic schools have relatively strong induction programmes. Third, some teachers&#8212;particularly those beginning after the start of the school year or older teachers in their second year of teaching&#8212;may receive varied support. Findings from this research may provide framing for induction programmes in New Zealand as well as for international longitudinal studies of teacher induction models.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">induction</field><field name="subject">beginning teacher</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">primary</field><field name="subject">support</field><field name="subject">low socioeconomic</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3302</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Analysis of the integrin beta 7 gene promoter</field><field name="creator">Pandey, Sushil K</field><field name="description">The integrin cell adhesion molecules &#945;4&#946;7 (LPAM-1) and &#945;E&#946;7 (HML-1/M290) reside at the surface of white blood cells, and are critical for establishing and retaining the gut immune system that protects us against intestinal infections. &#945;4&#946;7 contributes to lymphocyte homing to the gut by binding to the vascular addressin MAdCAM-1 expressed on high endothelial venules in Peyer's patches, mesenteric lymph nodes and the lamina propria. &#945;E&#946;7 expressed on activated lymphocytes retains lymphocytes at mucosal surfaces by binding to E-cadherin expressed on epithelial cells. Unfortunately &#945;4&#946;7 and &#945;E&#946;7 also contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, and potentially multiple sclerosis by mediating the infiltration and retention of immune cells in inflamed tissues. Understanding the biology of integrins and other cell adhesion molecules will allow us to regulate their expression and function in vivo in order to attenuate inflammation. The mechanisms regulating the expression of integrins are poorly understood, but will be essential to unravel if we are to fully exploit newly devised gene therapy approaches to combat inflammation and cancer. The &#946;7 gene promoter was isolated in our laboratory in order to understand the mechanisms directing the expression of &#946;7 integrins. It has previously been shown that TGF&#946;1 stimulates lymphoid expression of &#946;7 and &#945;E RNA transcripts leading to de novo expression of &#945;E&#946;7 at the cell-surface. In contrast, &#945;4 subunit levels representative of the gut homing integrin &#945;4&#946;7 are decreased. This suggests that TGF&#946;1 produced by intestinal epithelial cells may switch migrating lymphocytes from expressing &#945;4&#946;7 to &#945;E&#946;7, thereby facilitating their retention within the gut intraepithelial compartment. This occurs by a mechanism involving the increased binding of nuclear factors to two TGF&#946;1 response regions (TGFBRR) designated TGFBRR 1 and 2 within the mouse &#946;7 gene promoter that had previously been identified as DNAsc I hypersensitivity regions. Here it has been determined that six potential Spl binding sites residing within the &#946;7 gene promoter interact with either Sp1 or both Sp1 and Sp3. TGFBRR1 contains one Sp1 binding cis-element whereas TGFBRR2 contains two such elements. Gene reporter analysis revealed that Sp1 and Sp3 positively and negatively regulate basal &#946;7 gene promoter activity, respectively. Sp1 synergizes with c-Jun, a member of the AP1 group of transcription factors to facilitate DNA-binding and to superactivate &#946;7 gene promoter activity. Deletion analysis revealed that a reporter construct containing a minimal &#946;7 gene promoter encompassing nucleotides (nt) -78 to +95 is more active than a reporter containing nt -690 to +95. Further analysis revealed the presence of a repressor site within nt -105 to -78. Since no TGF&#946;1 responsive Smad cis-elements could be detected within the promoter, it is believed that TGF&#946;1 controls expression of &#946;7 through multiple Sp1 binding sites. The interaction of Sp1 with c-Jun may facilitate &#946;7 gene expression, whereas Sp3 may antagonize Sp1-driven promoter activity. Presumably, other factors yet to be identified maintain tissue specificity. Whether the inhibitor region plays a role in the later process remains to be determined.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3191</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the relationship between family involvement and outcome in residential interventions for children</field><field name="creator">Woodfield, Melanie Joslyn</field><field name="description">Family participation in residential interventions for children has been reliably shown to enhance children&#8217;s adaptation to the community following discharge.

A &#8216;high family involvement&#8217; condition, a community-based programme that followed a residential intervention, was compared with a &#8216;low family involvement&#8217; condition (the traditional residential programme). No statistically significant differences were observed between the groups on parent-report measures of child behaviour and parenting practices, although significant improvements in children&#8217;s behaviour (including emotional, social and conduct aspects) for both groups were found. Reasons for the lack of difference between the groups, and the difficulties inherent in conducting outcome research in a residential facility for children are highlighted. Other influences on outcome for children and families, such as residential staff members&#8217; attitudes toward family involvement were also examined. The optimal conditions for successful short-term residential interventions for children are proposed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380107 Health, clinical and counselling psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3193</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Angels at our tables: New Zealanders' experiences of hearing voices</field><field name="creator">Beavan, Vanessa</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to explore the experience of hearing voices in the general New Zealand adult population. This included mapping the topography of voices and the impact of the experience on participants&#8217; lives, exploring participants&#8217; explanatory models, investigating coping strategies and support structures, and developing a model of the essence of hearing voices.  Quantitative and qualitative analyses of questionnaire (n=154) and interview (n=50) data revealed a great diversity of experiences, both within and among participants.  Of all topographical variables significantly related to emotional impact (content, form, duration, intrusiveness and control), voice content was the only significant predictor variable, accurately predicting the emotional response of 93.3% of participants. Overall, participants who valued their voice experiences tended to have spiritual beliefs, a more positive emotional reaction and less contact with mental health services.  In contrast, participants who experienced mostly unwanted voices tended to have biological and/or psychological understandings of their voice experiences, a more negative emotional reaction to them, and increased contact with mental health services.  Participants reported using a vast array of coping strategies, with varying degrees of success. Individualised techniques were reported to be the most effective, followed by setting aside a time to listen to the voices. In terms of help and support, participants called for a model of intervention that accepted their voice experiences as real, took an holistic approach incorporating contextual, cultural and spiritual factors, and worked with voice-hearers, their families and the public to provide information about voice phenomena and normalise the experience.  Using a phenomenological approach, a model of the essential structure of hearing voices is proposed, comprising five components: the content of the voices is personally meaningful to the voice-hearer; the voices have a characterised identity; the person has a relationship with their voices; the experience has a significant impact on the voice-hearer&#8217;s life; and the experience has a compelling sense of reality. The implications of this research include validating voice-hearers&#8217; perspectives of the experience, informing clinical work with voice-hearers, and informing the development of local and national-level services, such as a New Zealand Hearing Voices Network.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Auditory hallucinations</field><field name="subject">Voices</field><field name="subject">Psychosis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3175</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inhibin-like activity in bull seminal plasma</field><field name="creator">Peek, John Charles</field><field name="description">Testicular function is stimulated from the pituitary gland by the gonadotrophic hormones FSH and LH. The testis in turn regulates gonadotrophin secretion by negative feedback. The agents of feedback are steroids, and in addition, probably a protein hormone, which has been given the name inhibin. A method capable of detecting inhibin-like activity in bull seminal plasma (bSP) was developed. Administration of bSP at the time of castration to five-week old male rats inhibited the post-castration rise of serum concentrations of FSH and LH otherwise seen 24 h later. The degree of inhibition depended on the dose; 0.5 ml bSP or the equivalent amount of bSP-extract always suppressed FSH and LH to levels typical of intact rats. The rats' sensitivity to 0.2 ml bSP varied with the time of year, possibly reflecting seasonal changes in the onset of puberty. The time-course of action of bSP-extract was studied in intact rats. Serum FSH was suppressed 12, 24 and 48 h after a single injection, but not at 3 or 6 h. LH was suppressed at 6, 12, 24 and possibly 48 h.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321014 Obstetrics and gynaecology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3177</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of the leucocyte activation antigens CG-1, CD100 and HML-1</field><field name="creator">Print, Cristin Gregor</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the investigation of three novel leucocyte activation antigens. The investigation began with the characterisation of the &#945;HML-1 integrin subunit. Immunoprecipitation analysis and Western blotting indicated that &#945;HML-1 associates with the &#946;7 integrin subunit to form a typical integrin heterodimer. &#945;HML-1 appears to be post-translationally cleaved into heavy and light chains which remain linked by disulphide bonds. With the aim of isolating the &#945;HML-1 protein, a 45kDa disulphide-linked polypeptide was isolated from leucocytes by two-dimensional non-reducing / reducing gel electrophoresis, and used to raise a polyclonal antiserum. This polyclonal antiserum detected a protein encoded by a cDNA in a &#955;gt11 leucocyte expression library. This cDNA was designated CG-1. It became apparent that CG-1 did not encode the &#945;HML-1 protein, but rather encoded a novel protein which is abundantly expressed in activated leucocytes and reproductive tissues, and weakly expressed in all other tissues examined. The CG-1 gene may be one member of a larger gene family, as two different chicken relatives of CG-1 have been isolated elsewhere. The deduced CG-1 amino acid sequence contains potential transmembrane domains and a potential nuclear localisation signal motif. On the basis of its primary structure the CG-1 protein is expected to form an &#945; helical coiled-coil dimer. A polyclonal antisera raised against a CG-1 - &#946;-galactosidase fusion protein detected a 300kDa protein on the surface of activated human leucocytes. The apparent molecular weight of this protein is halved following the reduction of disulphide bonds, supporting the contention that CG-1 is a disulphide-linked cell-surface dimer. This protein appears to be associated with tyrosine kinase activity in an in vitro kinase assay. While participating in the Fifth International Conference on Leucocyte Differentiation Antigens we noted that the protein detected by the anti-CG-1 antisera was remarkably similar to a novel leucocyte protein designated CD100. CD100 is a T lymphocyte co-stimulatory antigen capable of signalling in concert with the T lymphocyte antigen receptor to produce T lymphocyte proliferation. Like the protein detected by the anti-CG-1 antisera, CD 100 was associated with tyrosine kinase activity in an in vitro kinase assay, and appeared to be a 300kDa disulphide-linked cell-surface dimer. Anti-CD100 antibodies were able to remove the protein detected by the anti-CG-1 antisera from leucocyte lysates in immunodepletion experiments. This suggests that CG-1 and CD100 are immunologically related, or that CD100 and the protein detected by the anti-CG-1 antisera are physically associated. Current research is directed toward determining the relationship between CG-1 and CD100, and investigating the signalling and costimulatory potential of these molecules. The three leucocyte activation antigens investigated in this thesis all appear to mediate leucocyte transmembrane signalling. All three molecules potentially form the basis of therapeutic approaches for immunoregulation of inflammatory and neoplastic disease.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3194</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ovine placental lactogen: purification and properties</field><field name="creator">Reddy, Shivanand</field><field name="description">A procedure was developed to purify ovine placental lactogen (oPL) from fetal cotyledonary tissue of late gestation.

CsA is a potent suppressor of T-lymphocyte function and it&#8217;s biological effects have been defined almost exclusively in these terms. However, recent studies in which the agent was shown to exacerbate a T-lymphocyte independent, experimentally induced bacterial infection of the kidney (pyelonephritis), indicated that CsA had effects on host defence mechanisms other than T-lymphocytes. The present study, using animal models, was undertaken to identify the host defence component modified by CsA. Neutrophils are a key component in the early response to infection and the administration of CsA resulted in an increase in the number of these cells in the circulation. When the effect of CsA on the in vitro metabolic activity of neutrophils and their ability to kill microorganisms was investigated, no changes were observed, but the in vivo ability of neutrophils to emigrate from the vasculature to a sterile inflammatory foci was markedly impaired. A model of localised subcutaneous infection was used to determine the effect of this CsA-associated suppression of neutrophil emigration on the ability of the host to mount a response to an infectious challenge. In CsA treated animals, neutrophil accumulation in E. coli infected, subcutaneously implanted sponges was initially suppressed, allowing bacterial numbers to increase rapidly. By 48 hours this powerful bacterial stimulus overrode the suppressive effects of CsA and led to a substantial increase in the size of the neutrophilic infiltrate. This finding of an initially reduced inflammatory response, followed by an increase in the influx of inflammatory cells, provided a possible explanation for the earlier observation that CsA promoted infection and tissue damage in experimental pyelonephritis. The relationship between the effect of CsA on neutrophil emigration and the pathogenesis of experimental pyelonephritis was therefore investigated. When CsA was administered to animals prior to inducing pyelonephritis, the neutrophilic infiltrate was markedly suppressed in the early stages. As predicted, this led to a logarithmic increase in bacterial numbers, the infiltration of large numbers of neutrophils and, ultimately, an exacerbation of tissue damage. Further studies, examining the effects of CsA on neutrophil-mediated inflammatory mechanisms, identified impaired neutrophil-to-endothelial cell adhesion as the most likely explanation for the observed defect in host defences. The integrated nature of cellular defence mechanisms in infectious disease is highlighted by these investigations. when microorganisms invade tissue, even though the number and function of circulating leucocytes may be normal their effective participation in the host response to infection depends on the ability to emigrate from the blood vessels to the site of infection. In summary, the discovery of additional properties of CsA provide an explanation for the patterns of infectious disease in patients treated with CsA, in whom infection with extracellular pathogens is common. It also seems likely that the ability of CsA to suppress neutrophil emigration may contribute to the effectiveness of the agent in the management of inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, uveitis and psoriasis.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3195</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cognitive factors in the maintenance of chronic fatigue syndrome</field><field name="creator">Moss-Morris, Rona Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is an illness characterized by persistent debilitating fatigue of uncertain origin. Precipitating and perpetuating factors of this illness are thought to be distinct and the aim of this thesis was to gain greater insight into the role of cognitive factors which may maintain the condition. This work was guided by two central frameworks, the self-regulatory model of illness representations and the cognitive taxonomy of psychopathology. These were used to define the different cognitive constructs and to investigate the way they function as a system to maintain pathological schema and disability in CFS. Three studies using different methodologies were conducted to test the hypotheses. The first employed a descriptive comparative design to ascertain whether CFS patients have unique cognitions which contribute to their disability over time. The sample was comprised of CFS patients without depression (n=39), CFS patients with a concurrent diagnosis of depression (n=14), patients with a primary diagnosis of depression (n=20); and healthy controls (n=38). The groups were matched in aggregate for age, gender, race, and education. Subjects completed the Cognitive Errors Questionnaire-Revised, which measures cognitive distortions relevant to both general and somatic events, and the Illness Perception Questionnaire, which measures the five dimensions of the illness representation in conjunction with other standard measures. Between-group analyses confirmed that the depressed group was distinguished by a low self-esteem, feelings of guilt and self-recriminations, the propensity to make cognitive distortions across all situations, and to attribute their illness to internal, stable and global factors. In contrast, the CFS patients were characterized by low ratings of their current health status, a strong illness identity, external attributions for their illness, and distortion in thinking that were specific to somatic experiences. CFS depressed patients had lower self-esteem than non-depressed patients and had the most pessimistic illness beliefs. A six month follow-up showed that CFS patients' cognitive structures and level of disability remained remarkably stable. Illness identity, serious consequences, somatic errors, and limiting coping accounted for a substantial proportion of the variance in CFS patients&#8217; disability scores over time. These results are discussed in terms of their support for both of the cognitive models. CFS patients appeared to have distinct cognitions which were associated with ongoing disability. The subsequent two quasi-experimental studies were conducted in a single laboratory session. The first of these used standardized neuropsychological tests to determine whether psychological variables, particularly somatic focus, interfere with CFS patients&#8217; performance on high load attention tasks. The discrepancy between CFS patients&#8217; subjective reports of concentration and memory difficulties and objective evidence of these deficits was also investigated. The subjects included 25 CFS patients matched for age, gender, and intelligence with two groups of healthy controls. One of these groups underwent a somatic induction procedure as part of the investigation of the effects of somatic preoccupation on attention tasks. The tests included the verbal memory subscales from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT), a measure of divided attention and speed of information processing. The analyses of the induction data failed to support the validity of this procedure resulting in the somatic control group being dropped from the analysis. Consistent with previous studies the principal deficit in the CFS group appeared to be on the PASAT. The CFS group appeared to be less accurate than healthy controls in their appraisal of their performance, which were related to negative mood rather than objective performance. Depression was also related to high performance expectations in the CFS group, but not the controls. The results did not support the original assumption that somatic preoccupation contributes to neuropsychological difficulties in CFS. However, mood factors were clearly shown to impact on both the objective and subjective experience of symptoms. The aim of the final study was to investigate the concordance between the self-report data collected in study one and information processing biases in CFS. Comparisons of the CFS patients and healthy controls on a modified Stroop attention task and a self-schema memory task, found no evidence of an illness-related bias in CFS patients&#8217; processing of information. Rather, they demonstrated a significant tendency to be distracted by and remember depressed-relevant stimuli. The exception was their propensity to make somatic interpretations. These results are discussed in terms of the defensiveness hypothesis, which proposes that CFS patients&#8217; negative, external illness perceptions and somatic distortions may act as a defence against underlying feelings of low self-esteem. The complex nature of CFS patients&#8217; cognitive structures was revealed and the need to use measures which do not rely on self-reports was clearly demonstrated. These studies provided further support for the central role of cognitive factors and mood in perpetuating CFS.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321021 Psychiatry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3225</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of the inducible transcription factors in status epilepticus-induced delayed neuronal death</field><field name="creator">Preston, Kerin Maree (nee)</field><field name="description">Status epilepticus (SE) is a serious neurological disorder, characterised by prolonged and/or frequent seizure activity. Following SE, a selective and delayed neuronal death (DND) occurs in limbic regions of the brain, particularly in the hippocampus. The objective of this thesis was to investigate the molecular basis of SE-induced DND in the Wistar rat hippocampus. Following the induction of SE, moribund (i.e. dead/dying) neurons were identified by histological staining, DNA fragmentation and an increase in activated microglia. Clusterin, a glycoprotein implicated in apoptotic cell death was also observed to accumulate in the soma and axons of moribund neurons 72-144 hr following SE. Morphological evidence suggested that dying neurons exhibited many of the classical features of apoptosis (i.e. apoptotic body formation, oligo-nucleosomal DNA fragmentation and rapid phagocytosis of debris) and therefore raised the possibility that SE-induced DND might be programmed (i.e. requiring de novo protein synthesis). To investigate this hypothesis I have examined the temporal and anatomical expression of a number of proteins which may have a critical role in SE-induced DND. The expression of the inducible transcription factors (ITFs) was examined as they couple extracellular stimulation to the transcription of late effector gene(s), resulting in long-term phenotypical changes in the neuron and therefore, they may couple SE-inducing stimulation with DND. A high correlation was shown between neurons which exhibited a delayed and prolonged ITFP expression and those which were selectively vulnerable to SE-induced DND (e.g. CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells and dentate hilar neurons). However, administration of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin following the induction of SE reduced the ITFPs expression, but resulted in an increase in SE-induced DND after 48 hr. However, the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-like immunoreactivity were also shown to attenuate at this time after this procedure. Thus, protein synthesis inhibitors administered following SE may attenuate the level of trophic support and promote cell death. To further investigate the role of the ITFPs in nerve cell death, etoposide, a DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor, which is known to facilitate apoptosis was infused into the hippocampus. The results suggested that a complex ITFP expression occurred which preceded nerve cell death. Moreover, this nerve cell death occurred earlier (12-24 hr) and was not anatomically selective. Furthermore, following the etoposide infusion, clusterin was expressed in the hippocampal pyramidal cells, in the dentate hilar neurons and in the dentate granule cells, however the latter exhibited the strongest BDNF-like immunoreactivity. In summary, circumstantial evidence suggests that the ITFPs may form a critical component in the cascade of events which couple toxic stimulation to nerve cell death. However, this thesis demonstrates that the ITFPs have a complex role in DND, as although the ITFPs may be sufficient to induce DND, they may not always be necessary (e.g. in the absence of sufficient trophic support).</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3197</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of the mechanisms of resistance of non-cycling cells to amsacrine and related antitumour drugs</field><field name="creator">Robbie, Maxine Ann</field><field name="description">Several studies have shown that non-cycling cells are resistant to the cytotoxic effects induced by amsacrine (m-AMSA; 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulphon-m-anisidide). This resistance may limit the activity of m-AMSA and related 9-anilinoacridine antitumour agents against solid tumours. The biochemical mechanism(s) for this resistance have been investigated using spontaneously transformed Chinese hamster fibroblast (AA8 cells) in log- and plateau-phase spinner cultures. In early plateau phase most cells entered a growth-arrested state with a G1-G0 DNA content and showed a marked decrease in sensitivity to cytotoxicity after a 1-h exposure to m-AMSA or its solid tumour-active analogue, CI-921. Studies with radiolabelled m-AMSA demonstrated that changes in sensitivity to m-AMSA-induced cell killing were not due to a difference in uptake or retention of drug by log- and plateau-phase cells, and there was no significant metabolism of drug by either log- or plateau-phase cells. Thus, after a 1-h exposure to [3H]-m-AMSA at 37&#176;C, a small proportion (1%) of cell-associated radioactivity was covalently bound to macromolecules, but most of the cell-associated radioactivity represented unchanged m-AMSA. There was no evidence for any oxidative metabolism to reactive quinoidal species in these tumour cells. However, studies with a fluorescence assay for DNA unwinding indicated that plateau-phase cells were 3 to 4 times less sensitive to m-AMSA-induced DNA breakage than log-phase cells, and changes in sensitivity to m-AMSA-induced DNA breakage correlated with changes in sensitivity to cell killing by m-AMSA as cell progressed from log to plateau phase. Further studies showed that the decrease in sensitivity to m-AMSA-induced DNA stand breakage correlated with a decrease in sensitivity to covalent DNA-protein complex formation in plateau-phase cells after m-AMSA treatment. Combined with evidence that the DNA lesions rapidly disappeared from both log- and plateau-phase cells following the removal of m-AMSA (half-time approx. 4 min), this indicated that the lesions detected by the FADU assay probably arose from the stimulation of DNA-topoisomerase II (topo II) cleavable complex formation by m-AMSA. K+/SDS precipitation assays with [32p] 3&#8217;-end-labelled pBR322 DNA indicated that nuclear extracts containing topo II activity from plateau-phase cells were 3- to 4-fold less sensitive to stimulation of DNA-topo II complex formation by m-AMSA than nuclear extracts from log-phase cells. This change in sensitivity to m-AMSA-induced DNA-topo II complex formation was therefore similar to that observed with intact cells. However, P4 unknotting assays indicated that topo II activity in nuclear extracts from plateau-phase cells was only 2-fold lower than that in nuclear extracts from log-phase cells. Resistance to treatment with m-AMSA may therefore reflect a decrease in topo II activity and/or a decrease in sensitivity of topo II enzymes to stimulation of cleavable complex formation by m-AMSA in non-cycling cells.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321020 Pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3198</field></doc><doc><field name="title">TATA binding protein in Alzheimer's Disease</field><field name="creator">Reid, Suzanne J</field><field name="description">Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a late onset neurodegenerative disorder, affecting tens of thousands of people in New Zealand, as well as their families and caregivers. AD is characterised by extra cellular &#946;-amyloid (&#946;A) deposition, Tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and progressive cortical atrophy. Abnormal protein accumulation is also a common feature of other late onset neurodegenerative diseases, including the heritable polyglutamine (polyQ) disorders such as Huntington disease (HD) and the spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). One of this family of disorders, SCA17, is caused by an expansion of a polymorphic polyQ repeat in TATA binding protein (TBP), an essential transcription factor. Surprisingly, the wild type TBP repeat length ranges from 25-42, and in Caucasian populations the most common allele is 38, a size large enough to cause HD if within the huntingtin protein. Wild type length TBP accumulates in the disease structures of HD and in at least some of the SCAs. The work described in this thesis investigates the hypothesis that the TATA binding protein (TBP) contributes to AD. This thesis describes the discovery that TBP accumulates in AD brain, localising to NFTs. Also, a proportion of the detectable TBP present is insoluble; a signature of the polyQ diseases. TBP positive structures are shown to be present differentially between patients and its amount and distribution is not directly proportional to that of Tau or &#946;-amyloid positive structures. To investigate if the polyQ repeat length in TBP is associated with AD, alleles were genotyped from two large case/control cohorts. In one cohort, but not the other, older patients carried longer TBP polyQ repeats than controls, and the effect was enhanced when subjects homozygous for the ApoE4 allele were removed from the dataset. Evidence is presented that transcriptional activation by HMGBI, a chromatin associated protein that binds to the polyQ tract within TBP, is altered when co-expressed with TBP carrying 90 glutamines. Taken together this data provides evidence for the hypothesis that the accumulation or misfolding of this polyQ containing protein may be a contributing factor in Alzheimer's disease.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320500 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3199</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of the beta7 integrin gene in T cells: role of the MAPK signalling pathways</field><field name="creator">Shafiei, Farhad, 1974-</field><field name="description">Members of the integrin superfamily of adhesion molecules are involved in cell to cell, cell to ECM, and cell to pathogen interactions, and are of fundamental importance in many biological processes. The &#946;7 integrins &#945;4&#946;7 and &#945;E&#946;7 have evolved to play specialized roles in gut mucosal immunity. &#945;4&#946;7 mediates the homing of lymphocytes to intestinal Peyer's patches, mesenteric lymph nodes, and the lamina propria by binding to the vascular addressin MAdCAM-1 (Fong et al., 1997). &#945;E&#946;7 binds epithelial E-cadherin retaining lymphocytes at the intraepithelial compartment of the mucosa. The expression of &#945;E&#946;7 is induced on migratory lymphocytes by TGF-&#946; secreted by gut enterocytes. The signalling mechanisms responsible for basal and TGF-&#946;-induced expression of &#946;7 integrins are not well understood. Previous studies identified two TGF-&#946;1 response regions in the &#946;7 gene promoter termed TGFBRR-1 and TGFBRR-2 encompassing nucleotides -509 to -398 and -121 to -34. Here, TGF-&#946;1 activation of the &#946;7 gene proximal promoter is shown to be mediated by MAPK family members. TGF-&#946;1 stimulation of TK-1 T cells increased the steady-state mRNA levels of the &#946;7 gene relative to &#945;4 transcripts, and led to enhanced phosphorylation of c-Jun. TGF-&#946;1 stimulation induced rapid increases in the binding of nuclear protein complexes to TGFBRR-1 and -2. Sp1 and Sp3 which mediate TGF-&#946;1 signalling were shown to bind to an Sp1 cis-element encompassing nucleotide positions -67 to -60 within TGFBRR-2. The interaction of Sp1 with its cognate binding site was c-Jun dependent. In contrast, there was no evidence for involvement of the Smad proteins. ATF-2 was identified to bind to a region encompassing nucleotide positions -699 to -689 just upstream of TGFBRR-1. Sp1 and ATF-2 expression vectors co-transfected into Sp1-deficient SL-2 cells synergized to drive the activity of a &#946;7 gene luciferase reporter. Mutation of the ATF-2-binding site modestly reduced &#946;7 gene reporter activity. The involvement of c-Jun in TGF-&#946; signalling and interaction of Sp1 with the &#946;7 gene promoter suggested that MAP kinase pathways might mediate &#946;7 gene transcription. Specific chemical inhibitors were used to ascertain which of the three MAPK pathways namely p38, JNK, and ERK were involved. Results obtained by nuclear run-on transcription analysis which measures nascent RNA synthesis showed that both the p38 and JNK pathways regulate &#946;7 gene expression in TK-1 cells, whereas only the p38 pathway regulates &#945;4 gene expression. Thus, treatment of TK-1 cells with the p38 inhibitor SB203580 and the JNK inhibitor SP600125 inhibited the synthesis of &#946;7 transcripts, whereas only SB203580 inhibited the synthesis of &#945;4 transcripts. Conversely, sodium arsenite which induces JNK and p38 upregulated nascent synthesis of &#945;4 and &#946;7 RNA transcripts. SB203580 blocked the binding of nuclear factors to TGFBRR-1, and ATF-2 binding to nucleotide position -699 to -689. Similarly, SP600125 blocked the binding of Sp1 and Sp3 to TGFBRR-2, whereas unexpectedly SB203580 enhanced their binding. Furthermore, both SB203580 and SP600125 decreased cell-surface expression of the &#946;7 subunit and SB203580 inhibited TK-1 cell adhesion to MAdCAM-1. In contrast, the MEK inhibitor PD98059 had no effect on the expression of nascent &#946;7 RNA transcripts and cell-surface expression of the &#946;7 subunit, suggesting that the ERK pathway is not involved in regulation of &#946;7 gene expression in TK-1 cells. In contrast to the results obtained with TK-1 cells, SB203580, SP600125, and PD98059 each inhibited the nascent synthesis of &#945;4, &#946;7, and &#945;E transcripts in peripheral blood lymphocytes. In conclusion, this study has revealed for the first time that both the p38 and JNK pathways mediate TGF-&#946;1-induced expression of the integrin &#946;7 gene. Expression of the &#946;7 gene is Sp1-dependent, and involves the synergistic cooperation of c-Jun and ATF-2. It is proposed that the p38 and JNK pathways play a role by triggering the activation and translocation of c-Jun and ATF-2 to the nucleus.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321020 Pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3216</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of the crystalline lens in ametropia</field><field name="creator">Scott, Rolene</field><field name="description">When examining the dimensions of the crystalline lens, it is found that some may vary with different types of refractive error.

No substantial difference was found between the two groups. In both groups of eyes, increased lens thickness was found to contribute significantly to the refractive state of the eye; a thicker lens effectively being a stronger lens. The crystalline lens may play a different role in early adult-onset myopia which develops after normal growth has ceased compared to its role in youth-onset myopia. Cross-sectional data from early adult-onset myopes, youth-onset myopes and emmetropes were evaluated to determine whether lens thickness differed among the refractive error groups. No significant differences were found. However, some early adult-onset myopes and youth-onset myopes were re-evaluated three years after the initial data were collected and a significant increase in mean lens thickness was, found in the group of early adult-onset, myopes. No significant mean lens thickness increase occurred in the group of youth-onset myopes. To evaluate further the contribution of the crystalline lens dimensions to the refractive state of the eye, radii of curvature and. lens thicknesses of a group of anisometropes were examined. Radii were found not to be consistently flatter or steeper in the relatively, more myropic eye compared with the relatively less myopic eye and there was also no significant difference between mean lens thickness of the relatively more myopic eye compared to mean lens thickness of the relatively less, myopic eye. Crystalline lens thickness and radii of curvature were therefore found to play only a minor role in refractive error development, Deeper vitreous chambers and steeper corneal curvatures were found to be the major contributors to myopia.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320900 Optometry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3220</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Breath hydrogen studies of lactose malabsorption in children resident in New Zealand, Cook Islands and Western Samoa</field><field name="creator">Seakins, John Medgley</field><field name="description">Lactose malabsorption (LM) in children was diagnosed by an elevated breath hydrogen (BH) level following a 10g lactose load. A portable gas chromatograph and a semiconductor detector, designed and constructed for use in the Pacific Islands is described. Following verification on known malabsorber and. normal subjects, the technique was used to determine the prevalence of LM in Europeans at Auckland and Rarotonga, and in Samoans at two locations in Auckland and two locations in Western Samoa. The prevalence of LM in Europeans was significantly (p&lt;0.01) higher at Rarotonga than at Auckland. For Samoans, the prevalence of LM was significantly (p&lt;0.01) higher in Western Samoa than at Auckland. The prevalence of LM was very highly significantly (p&lt;0.001) related to race. Each child tested for LM filled in a questionaire to determine attitude, consumption of and perceived intolerance to milk, milk biscuits and ice cream. Lactose malabsorption was significantly (p&lt;0.05) correlated to milk consumption and to attitude to dairy products, but not to sex, age, and perceived intolerance. The consumption of dairy products was very highly significantly (p&lt;0.0001) correlated to attitude, and highly significantly (p&lt;0.001) correlated to location and perceived intolerance. There was no significant correlation between consumption and race, sex or age. Perceived intolerance to individual dairy products was significantly correlated to attitude to milk (p&lt;0.0001), milk biscuits (p&lt;0.02) and ice cream (p&lt;0.001). Perceived intolerance was not related to age, sex, race, location or the actual symptoms following the consumption of 10g lactose. The unexpected finding of increased LM in the Pacific Islands, was investigated further by studying the LM status of the Medical Team during a visit to western Samoa, and by performing a microbiological survey of water quality. It was found that half of the Medical Team 3/6, became malabsorbers during the week spent in Western Samoa. On returning to New Zealand it was shown that lactase levels took 3 months to normalise. The water supply in Western Samoa was shown to contain very high levels of coliform bacteria. The currently held hypothesis that genetic factors are solely involved in the onset of LM, was not supported. The evidence from the survey supported environmental factors are also involved in adult onset LM. The hypothesis suggesting that dietary lactose was a requirement for retaining elevated lactase levels, was tested using Galactosemic and Phenyl Ketonuria patients. None of the patients had developed LM although they had been on a low lactose diet for years, hence the theory was not supported. The BH method proved highly successful in diagnosing LM with many of the children actually enjoying it.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3201</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the GH/IGF axis in the infant rat brain following hypoxic ischemic injury</field><field name="creator">Scheepens, Arjan</field><field name="description">Brain injuries, be they hypoxic, ischemic, traumatic or neurodegenerative result in permanent neurological deficit and presently there are few or no therapeutic interventions available. Recent research into how and why brain cells die after an insult has elucidated that a significant number of cells die in an apoptotic manner. Following a transient brain injury cells continue to die for upto 5 days after the insult thereby giving a window of opportunity for treatment. In response to injury, the brain produces a range of neurotrophic hormones including insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I), which are thought to act as endogenous neuroprotective agents. This response occurs earlier and to a greater extent in the young. Studies have shown that the exogenous administration of these neurotrophic hormones after brain injury can prevent some cell death, likely through an inhibition of apoptosis. In these studies a well characterised model of HI brain injury in the juvenile rat was used to investigate the response of the IGF-I and growth hormone (GH) axes to brain injury. The action and transport of IGF-I is partly regulated by six binding proteins (IGFBP1-6) for which the response of IGFBP 1-5 to neural injury has been shown. The starting point therefore is a description of the response of IGFBP-6 to HI brain injury. Although the GH receptor is widely expressed in the brain on both neurones and glia, no reports have definitively shown the existence of its ligand, GH within the brain. Here I show that the GH receptor is differentially regulated after neural injury and that its immunolocalisation suggests an importation mechanisms for peripheral GH into the injured CNS, via the choroid plexus. Furthermore I show that a GH-like substance is strongly upregulated after injury, specifically associated with stressed and dying neurones and glia. Subsequently, I show that intracerebral infusions of rat GH into the injured rat brain conveys significant protection exclusively to GH receptor bearing neurones. In summary, these data show a GH-like substance may be acting as a new neurotrophic factor which is upregulated after brain injury and may act as an endogenous neuroprotective agent.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hypoxic-ischemic injury in the developing brain: pathogenesis and neuroprotection</field><field name="creator">Sizonenko, St&#233;phane Vladimir</field><field name="description">In newborn infants, birth asphyxia represents the predominant cause of brain injury. These infants will later exhibit neurodevelopmental disabilities or a more major cerebral palsy. Prevention of adverse outcomes requires an understanding of the way in which these deficits develop. Endogenous protective mechanisms arising from the insult have opened new insights in neuroprotective strategies. Neurotrophic factors such as IGF-1 and its N-terminal tripeptide GPE have been shown to confer some neuroprotection after HI injury in the adult rodent. In the P21 rat brain after moderate HI injury, exogenous intracerebral and intraperitoneal injections of GPE (30&#956;g and 300&#956;g respectively) were neuroprotective in the hippocampus and lateral cortex possibly through binding to glia as detected by autoradiography of 3H-GPE. In the preterm infant the mechanisms of white matter injury remain to be clearly elucidated. To mimic the pattern of diffuse cerebral injury of the very preterm infant, a transient moderate focal HI injury has been applied on the immature P3 rat. This new model showed a significant reduction in the lateral cortical volume with reduction and alteration of the myelination pattern in the cortical white matter (WM) at P21. These cortical alterations result from neuro-axonal damage 24h after the insult as shown with Fluoro-Jade B staining and &#946;-APP accumulation. In addition activated astrocytes from 24h after HI up to P21 were present. This model should enable us to elucidate some of the pathogenic mechanisms involved in diffuse WM injury. Brain damage in the developing brain has two components: 1) the pattern and mechanisms of injury are correlated with the stage of development at the time of injury; 2) it will influence subsequent brain development.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3212</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neurochemical and functional characterization of the ischaemic/reperfused retina</field><field name="creator">Sun, Daniel</field><field name="description">Ischaemic cell death has been implicated in a number of retinal diseases, including glaucomatous neuropathy, proliferative diabetic retinopathy and a range of vascular diseases. The cascade of events leading to cell death involves both cellular metabolic changes and a functional component. However, it is yet unknown how long these changes persist, whether all cell classes are affected, and the characteristics of recovery. Moreover, there have been few studies correlating the neurochemical changes with the ensuing functional changes. The aim of this thesis was to track the metabolic and functional recovery of the ischaemic rat retina, given the premise that: (1) amino acid neurochemistry reflects metabolic integrity and cellular identity, and; (2) the permeation of a cation channel probe called agmatine reflects channel functionality. Quantitative pattern recognition analysis of overlapping amino acid and agmatine expression profiles were used to provide a statistically robust classification of cells according to metabolic and functional characteristics. This classification was spatially complete and with single cell resolution. Finally, the electroretinogram was used to also assess retinal function and corroborate the observed neurochemical changes. These measures were taken at intervals for up to two weeks of reperfusion. The results show that by 48 hours of reperfusion, amino acid metabolism had returned to near normal levels, although cell classes were missing, and there was persistant cation channel gating anomalies. Immunocytochemical labeling identified a preferential loss of cone bipolar cells, with all remaining rod bipolar cells showing increased cation channel gating. The electroretinogram and agmatine experiments showed that this dysfunction is likely due to abnormal glutamate release from pre-synaptic photoreceptors, detected by changes in post-synaptic agmatine permeation, and not due to the presence of anomalous metabotropic glutamate receptors. Cholinergic amacrine cells demonstrated persistant neurochemical labeling, but did not show cationic flux following stimulation by glutamate agonists. In conclusion, the retina shows remarkable recovery in the amino acid metabolism, although functional changes persist. Finally, structural integrity or immunocytochemical labeling does not necessarily imply that cells maintain functional receptors, or that neurotransmitter release is normal secondary to disease.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321016 Opthalmology and vision science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3213</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Purification, biochemical and somatogenic characterisation of ovine placental lactogen</field><field name="creator">Singh, Kuljeet</field><field name="description">Ovine placental lactogen (oPL) is secreted by the placenta into both the fetal and maternal compartments. Its biological function(s) during pregnancy and the mechanisms involved are still unclear. A purification procedure was developed for oPL from sheep placental cotyledons of late gestation. Four procedures were attempted to obtain homogeneous oPL. Recoveries of oPL and total protein were measured throughout the several procedures using a specific oPL RIA and the Bradford protein estimation respectively. The third and fourth procedures resulted in homogeneous oPL and a partial amino acid sequence was obtained from the fourth procedure. In the successful procedures, the placental tissue was extracted with 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.5. A pH precipitation of the soluble fraction was performed, followed by 60% saturation with ammonium sulphate. Further separation steps involved chromatogaphic procedures. Carboxymethylcellulose (CM32) cation exchange was performed batchwise at pH 5.6. Subsequently chromatofocusing was performed to elute proteins in order of their isoelectric points. This was carried out using a pH gadient of 0.9 to 6.0. The final chromatographic step was reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) using a C4 column. To obtain homogeneous oPL in the third procedure, the partially purified oPL was subjected to SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The homogeneous oPL was eluted from the membrane, however, sequencing was unsuccessful. It was assumed that the N terminal of oPL was blocked. Homogeneous oPL was obtained in the fourth procedure by electrophoretic elution from the Hunkapiller gel system performed at 4&#176;C. The oPL was digested with trypsin, the fragments were separated by RP-HPLC chromatography and two peptides were sequenced. Peptide 1: F D E Q Y G Q G I Peptide 2: Y I N C H T Several strategies were attempted to provide more homogeneous oPL to enable more sequencing. The partially purified oPL fractions from each of these attempts were pooled and electrophoresed on an SDS polyacrylamide gel. The section of acrylamide containing the oPL band was homogenised and a trypsin digest was performed. The digested oPL was separated from the gel pieces, filtered through a Sep-Pak filter and the fragments were separated by RP-HPLC. The yield of oPL was low, but sufficient homogeneous oPL was obtained to provide a partial amino acid sequence from tryptic peptides. A further two peptides provided sequences. Peptide 3: (L) A G E M V N R F D E Q Y G Q G I Peptide 4: (L) Q P G K C Q I P L Q S L F Collaborators from Genentech Inc (San Francisco USA) used partially purified oPL produced from the present study and also obtained homogeneous oPL (Colosi et al., 1989). Complementary DNA clones of oPL were isolated and expressed in mammalian cells by recombinant DNA techniques (Colosi et al., 1989). These clones were sequenced, demonstrating that the full sequence of oPL consists of 198 amino acids preceded by a 38 amino acid sequence signal. Recombinant oPL was generated by Colosi et al. (1989) which provided sufficient material to perform physiological studies in vivo. The somatogenic effects of recombinant oPL were investigated in the growth hormone (GH) deficient dwarf rat and compared to identical doses of recombinant bovine GH (bGH) in 3 independent studies. Both oPL and bGH treatments resulted in an increase (p&lt;0.05) in body weight gain compared to that in saline treated controls, with oPL treatment being more potent than bGH (p&lt;0.05). In promoting linear growth, oPL was more potent (p&lt;0.05) than bGH in some instances. Nitrogen content of dry carcass matter was increased with oPL treatment compared to saline (p&lt;0.05), with a nonsignificant increase in bGH treated animals. Carcass fat was similarly reduced by both oPL and bGH treatment (p&lt;0.05) compared to saline. Serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) concentrations were increased significantly (p&lt;0.05) by both oPL and bGH treatments, with a significantly greater effect of oPL suggested in one study. No increase in hepatic IGF-I mRNA was evident with either treatment, suggesting that the increase in serum IGF-I is due to posttranscriptional mechanisms. The expression of IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) hepatic mRNA was increased (p&lt;0.05) with bGH treatment compared to that after saline treatment, but was unaffected by opL treatment, indicating regulation by GH at the transcriptional level. The binding of [125I]bGH to hepatic membrane preparations demonstrated no difference in specific binding compared to that in saline controls. However, [125I]oPL specific binding was greater in oPL treated animals (p&lt;0.05). Animals treated with bGH had reduced (p&lt;0.05) hepatic GH receptor mRNA compared to saline controls, but oPL treatment had no effect. Thus, oPL is a potent anabolic and lipolytic agent in the dwarf rat, exerting greater somatogenic effects on some parameters than bGH. The studies in this thesis have described biochemical and biological characterisitics of oPL. The amino acid sequence of oPL is more closely related to prolactin (PRL) than to GH (Colosi et al., 1989). However, oPL has potent somatogenic activities in the GH deficient dwarf rat. Our data suggest differences in receptor binding and effects on GH receptor and IGFBP-3 expression with these two treatments, raising the possibility of actions through different pathways or differential effects at the GH receptor level. These results do not fully resolve whether GH and PRL exert all effects through a single receptor or whether there is a separate PL receptor.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3247</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The order of premodifiers in English nominal phrases</field><field name="creator">Feist, James Murray</field><field name="description">The research reported in this thesis sought an explanation for the order of premodifiers in English nominal phrases. It aimed to establish what validity there is in the quite divergent earlier explanations, to find any other valid forms of explanation that might exist, and to integrate them all. The method was to make a wide survey of as many varieties of current English as possible, by observation; to then analyse the order at all levels (semantics, syntax, and so on); and to check the accuracy of the results against the 100-million-word British National Corpus. From that research, the thesis asserts that parts of most past approaches can be integrated into a comprehensive explanation; and that there is a new and important element of the full explanation, namely that of words' semantic structure, which is the combination of types and dimensions of meaning that make up the sense of each premodifier. Other new elements in this treatment of the subject are analysis of long groups of premodifiers (up to 10 words), consideration of why premodifiers regularly occur in different positions in the order, and explanation from the historical development of premodifier order. After an introductory chapter and a survey of the relevant literature, the thesis argues that the explanation of premodifier order in English nominal phrases is as follows. There are four positions for premodifiers, as in "your (1) actual (2) tinny (3) round (4) percussion instrument" [i.e. a tambourine] (chapter 3). The regular, unmarked order (illustrated in the phrase just quoted) has several elements of explanation: primarily, the semantic structure (chapter 4); secondarily, the syntactic structure (chapter 5). In a second type of order (when two or more words occur in one position), stylistic considerations control the order, not grammatical ones (chapter 7). In a third type of order, a marked one, a premodifier may be put in a position different from the position that the word's usual semantic structure would require, changing its meaning and stylistic effect (chapter 8). Some features of all three types of order are to be explained partly by their historical development - for example, the existence of borderline uses (chapter 9). There are some supporting explanations, from discourse structure and psycholinguistics, for example (chapter 10). The relevance of the previous chapters to wider issues, such as grammaticalisation, is discussed (chapter 11); and conclusions are drawn (chapter 12).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380200 Linguistics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3301</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of interleukin 2 and interleukin 3 in haemopoiesis</field><field name="creator">Le Gros, Graham Stephen</field><field name="description">The hormones interleukin 2 (ILZ) and interleukin 3 (IL3 can stimulate the growth of immature haemopoietic cells. These hormones are synthesised by mature thymus-derived (T) Iymphocytes. The observation that the haemopoietic tissue of the bone marrow contain few T lymphocytes leads to the question of what role IL2 and IL3 have in haemopoiesis. An original finding described in this thesis was that IL3 induced a population of haemopoietic cells to synthesise IL2, IL3, IL4 and GM-CSF when stimulated with complexes of antigen and antibody. This demonstrated that there were cells in the bone marrow which synthesised hormones normally considered T lymphocyte-derived. It was possible to correlate the production of IL2, IL3, IL4 and GM-CSF by IL3-dependent cells with Ag.Ab complex- and mast cell-associated inflammatory processes. A second finding described in this thesis was that haemopoietic cell lines dependent on IL3 for growth could be stimulated to grow by IL2. A unique feature of these IL3-dependent cell lines was that they could be adapted to an IL2-dependent growth state without further differentiation occurring. Such cells provide a tool for dissecting the intracellular growth regulating pathways which are controlled by IL2 and IL3. The influence of IL2 on the development of T lymphocytes in the microenvironment of the thymus was examined. It was found that the normal programme of T lymphocyte differentiation was altered by IL2. IL2 was found to stimulate the growth of an immature class of thymocytes which expressed cytotoxic activity. These cells had the potential to participate in host immune and inflammatory responses. The haemopoietic cell responses induced by IL2 and IL3 appear to reflect the differentiation of immature cells for roles in immune responses. This indicates that IL2 and IL3 may not have a role in normal haemopoietic cell development. The hormones which normally regulate the output of cells from the thymus and bone marrow may not yet be fully defined.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320200 Immunology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3221</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationships between neurotoxicity, accumulation, and physiochemical properties of a series of platinum drugs</field><field name="creator">Screnci, Daniela</field><field name="description">Peripheral neurotoxicity induced by some platinum chemotherapy agents is the dose limiting factor, seriously affecting the quality of life of chemotherapy patients who receive this treatment. The cause of the peripheral neurotoxicity remains unknown. Using an animal model, the neurotoxic profiles of a series of platinum compounds and their related stereoisomers were determined. The series consisted of cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin, S,S-oxaliplatin, ormaplatin, R,R- and S,S- ormaplatin and JM216. The neurotoxicity of these compounds in the animal model was correlated with their hydrophobicity, accumulation and reactivity. Also, using peripheral nerve tissues dissected at the end of treatment (or at specific timepoints) from the animals, morphological changes induced by the platinum compounds were also measured. Animals were administered the platinum compounds at the maximally tolerated dose, for a period of eight weeks, to determine the onset of neurotoxicity as indicated by changes in the sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV). The cumulative doses at which the platinum compounds in the series induced neurotoxicity (neurotoxic dose potency) in the animal model varied. Oxaliplatin induced neurotoxicity at the smallest dose and therefore at the earliest timepoint (l5&#181;mo1/kg, 3 weeks of treatment) and carboplatin induced neurotoxicity at the highest dose and the latest timepoint (322 &#181;mo1/kg, 8 weeks of treatment). The neurotoxic dose potency was compared to data obtained from the literature of incidence of neurotoxicity in patients. There was a strong correlation (r2 = 0.9871). It has previously been hypothesised (Gregg. et al. 1992) that platinum accumulation in peripheral nervous tissues plays a role in platinum induced neurotoxicity. Using tissues obtained from animal studies, the platinum concentration in peripheral nerve tissues was determined via Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry. There was no correlation between the amount of platinum accumulated in these tissues (dorsal root ganglia, sural nerve and sciatic nerve) and neurotoxicity. Furthermore it was expected that the accumulation of these compounds in the peripheral nervous system would be related to the hydrophobicity of the compound. The inverse was found to be true. The more hydrophilic the platinum compound, the greater the accumulation in the peripheral nerve tissues, and the more hydrophobic the platinum compound the lesser the accumulation in the peripheral nerve tissue (eg. drg r2 = 0.99, P=0.004). Using in vitro protein binding half life, the reactivity of compounds in the platinum series was assessed. It was determined that the neurotoxic compounds had a shorter half life and were more reactive than the non neurotoxic compounds. A positive correlation was also observed between reactivity and the incidence of neurotoxicity in patients (r2 = 0.89, P=0.0005). Tissues obtained from the animals were used to measure changes in dorsal root ganglia nucleolar diameter, and comparison made between the nucleolar diameter of each of the treatment groups, and their changes in SNCV. Strong correlations were observed between nucleolar diameter changes and altered SNCV in animals (r2=0.9971). From the above-mentioned studies, insight was gained into the physical parameters of the platinum compounds in the series that were associated with different neurotoxicity profiles. As yet a definite mechanism has not clearly defined but it is hypothesised to involve molecular nucleolar changes.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3217</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some aspects of human placental enzymology</field><field name="creator">Small, C.W.</field><field name="description">A.

Insulin bound specifically to both normal and transformed cells with similar dependence on temperature, time, and pH. There were fewer high affinity and more low .affinity receptors on tumour cells compared with normal adult fibroblasts. The affinity of insulin receptors in normal foetal fibroblasts was less than in normal adult fibroblasts while transformed foetal fibroblasts had receptors of even lower affinity. The sensitivity of insulin receptors to down regulation by insulin was measured in the human breast tumour cell lines MCF-7 and T-47D and the human colon tumour cell line HCT-8 and was compared with measurements in normal human adult fibroblasts. Adult fibroblasts were sensitive to down regulation (40% loss of binding after 2h exposure to 17nM insulin) whereas breast tumour cells were resistant to down regulation (15-17% loss of binding after 4h exposure to 170nM insulin). HCT-8 cells were sensitive to down regulation after 4h exposure to 3.8nM insulin but the extent of down regulation lessened at higher concentrations of insulin. This paradoxical result appeared due to an increase in the affinity of receptors on HCT-8 cells for insulin following exposure to hormone; by comparison, the affinity of receptors on fibroblasts significantly decreased during down regulation. Insulin-induced down regulation of receptors was also compared between normal and transformed foetal fibroblasts. Normal foetal fibroblasts were less sensitive to insulin-induced receptor down regulation than were adult fibroblasts. Transformed foetal fibroblasts had lost all high affinity receptors so that receptor down regulation was too low to measure. Biological responses to insulin (insulin-stimulated [3H]leucine incorporation into protein and [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA) were measured in parallel with studies of receptor regulation in order to assess the effect of down regulation on cell metabolism. Fibroblasts were more responsive to insulin-stimulated leucine and thymidine incorporation than were tumour cells. Down regulation of insulin receptors decreased the responsiveness of fibroblasts but not tumour cells to insulin-stimulated leucine incorporation. Responsiveness of tumour cells to insulin-stimulated leucine incorporation paradoxically increased with lengthy exposure to insulin. The responsiveness of fibroblasts to insulin-stimulated thymidine incorporation was unchanged following receptor down regulation and insulin did not induce a change in cell number. Insulin had variable effects on thymidine incorporation in tumour cells and in most instances induced parallel changes in cell growth. Tumour cells thus differ from normal cells in their expression and regulation of insulin receptors and their responsiveness to insulin. These differences may well contribute to the metabolic and growth advantage that tumour cells have over normal tissue.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3231</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Systems approach to a comprehensive community project: a study in community psychology</field><field name="creator">Seymour, Frederick William</field><field name="description">This thesis uses the concepts and methods of community psychology, and. applies them to what is called here a &#8220;comprehensive community project&#8221;. This is a project that undertakes to meet the needs of a community by fostering and strengthening the community&#8217;s own resources. The objectives of the research were : (1) to establish a comprehensive community project in the Auckland. suburbs of Birkdale and Beachhaven, and (2) to propose and. test a model for project organization and evaluation. The model was derived. from the systems approach to programme evaluation which provides a reasoned and. logical approach to all aspects of programme management. The model proposed involved systematic steps from initial programme planning to outcome measurement. The steps are, specifying the "system&#8221; or particular project, forming the values from which interventions would be derived, assessing needs and. resources, setting annual goals for activities from the foregoing steps, allocating available resources to activities, implementing and. reviewing activities, measuring outcome after one year, and feedback of this information for project improvement. Application of the model to the &#8220;Birkdale Project&#8221; showed that the model was relevant to management needs, and.

The effect of chronic active pyelonephritis on renal function was studied and the effect of antibiotic treatment and elimination of infection on the pathological changes in pyelonephritis was determined. Eradication of infection did not affect the gross pathology and histopathological changes found at autopsy. These experiments have also investigated the role of bacterial interference as a determinant in the epidemiology of renal infection. It was shown that mixed renal infections with E.coli were uncommon and that the pattern of infection was determined by the resident pathogen. The relationship between bacterial infection or the renal parenchyma with E.coli and the establishment of pathological lesions was investigated and the conclusion reached that infection of the kidney is not always associated with pathological changes. The term "acquiescent infection" was then used to describe the host parasite relationship in which active persistent bacterial infection is not associated with pathological lesions. Antigen presentation as a factor in the protective immune response to renal infection was also studied and experiments carried out which demonstrated that immunological memory to the Somatic antigen of E.coli persisted for at least Six months after primary immunization and appeared to be carried by the B lymphocytes. The distribution of B lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and lymphoid sites and the functional capacity of T cells during the course of pyelonephritis were also investigated. Lymphocytes forming the lymphocytic infiltrate in the kidney were identified an thymus derived lymphocytes by their surface labelling characteristics but further experiments showed that T lymphocytes in the kidney, which would normally respond to stimulation with PHA in-vitro, were non-responsive and presumably non-functional. A unique factor associated with renal cells was found to be capable of blocking the PHA response of T lymphocytes, suggesting that ablation of cell-mediated immune mechanisms in the kidney may contribute to the persistence of infection in pyelonephritis. This concept was investigated by studying the effect of a selective deficiency of thymus derived lymphocytes on the course of pyelonephritis. The experiments showed, however, that ablation of T lymphocytes did not appreciably alter the course of the disease. Further experiments were then carried out investigating the role of B lymphocytes in the immune response by manipulation of the hosts immune capacity using immunosuppressive drugs. Animals with pyelonephritis did not produce antibacterial antibody but were able to eliminate organisms more readily from the infected kidney than untreated animals with a normal immune response. This suggests that blocking of the phenomenon of immunologic enhancement may explain these unexpected results and that the immune response to renal infection could have an enhancing role, protecting the bacterial cell from otherwise effective host defense mechanisms. Clinical aspects of antimicrobial resistance in pyelonephritis were also investigated in a study of urinary tract pathogens from 120 patients. The results showed that standard methods for testing antibiotic sensitivity may reject potentially useful antibiotics and that up to 75% of microorganisms considered resistant to individual antibiotics may in fact be sensitive to concentrations of antibiotic attainable in the tubular lumen. In certain circumstances the determination of minimum inhibitory concentration of selected antibiotics may be of considerable value in patient management.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3240</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A scanning electron microscopic and electrophysiological investigation of experimental acoustic trauma</field><field name="creator">Thorne, Peter Rowland, 1954-</field><field name="description">Investigations were undertaken to describe and quantitate the topographical abnormalities which develop in the organ of Corti as a result of acoustic trauma, and to determine their relationship to the associated losses of cochlear function assessed by the compound action Potential (N1) and cochlear microphonics (CM). Thirty guinea pigs were exposed, while anaesthetised, to a tone of 3 KHz at 125 dB SPL for 30 minutes. Both organs of Corti were examined by scanning electron microscopy either immediately or 1,3,7 or 14 days after exposure. In the second study 26 anaesthetised guinea pigs were exposed to 5 KHz at 125 dB SPL for 30 minutes. Cochlear potentials were recorded from the round window of the right cochlea and N1 audiograms (sound Pressure level required to elicit N1 Plotted against frequency) and 10 &#956;v isopotential curves (sound pressure level required to produce 10 &#956;v CM plotted against frequency) were produced for each animal either within one hour or 1,7,14 or 28 days later. The same organ of Corti was examined by scanning electron microscopy. Cochlear potentials were compared to mean values from 16 normal guinea pigs. Most animals developed topographical changes in one or both organs of Corti after exposure to 3 KHz (90%) and in the right organ of Corti after 5 KHz (92%). There was a wide variation in both the length (3 KHz: 0.1-4.15 mm; 5 KHz: 0.5-16.0 mm) of lesions and the number of hair cells affected. Both these indices of damage increased significantly (p &lt;0.01) in the 24 hours following exposure to 5 KHz. Early damage to hair cells included either collapse, fusion or loss of stereocilia and there was an increase in the proportion of affected cells towards the centre of the lesions where supporting cells were damaged also. Subsequent to exposure, collapsed stereocilia appeared to become fused and some hair cells, particularly OHC, with stereocilia abnormalities were lost. However, others, particularly IHC, remained for up to 28 days despite abnormal stereocilia. Early changes occurred around the position of maximum displacement of the basilar membrane and subsequent extension of the lesions occurred equally in both apical and basal directions. Fusion was the only stereocilia change to develop after exposure. Regions of the organ of Corti showing supporting cell damage were replaced within 3-7 days by the proliferation of inner sulcus and Claudius&#8217; cells. The substantial initial loss of both N1 thresholds and CM sensitivity partially recovered during the first 24 hours after exposure, but paradoxically, this was associated with the significant increase in the topographical changes in the organ of Corti. N1 threshold loss occurred over all frequencies and was maximum 1/2 &#8211; 1 octave higher than the exposure frequency (5 KHz). All lesions occurred within regions corresponding to changes in N1 thresholds. In the first 24 hours topographical changes occurred over a much smaller area of the organ of Corti than indicated by changes in N1 thresholds. Seven or more days later the longer lesions (30%) reflected the extent of changes in N1 but the remainder were smaller than indicated by this functional loss. This suggests that functionally important damage to the cochlea is more extensive than indicated by hair cell loss, stereocilia abnormality or supporting cell changes in the organ of Corti. Therefore, investigations of the effects of noise should not be based simply on topographical changes in the organ of Corti as these often underestimate the extent of injury to the cochlea.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321020 Pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3251</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Epidemiology of birthweight and placental weight in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Thompson, John Michael David</field><field name="description">The introduction to this thesis is a literature review. Kramer, in a study commissioned by WHO, reviewed the literature prior to 1985 on low birthweight. This is extended, mainly in respect to infants who are small for gestational age with emphasis on important findings in relation to birthweight since that time. Work in New Zealand on birthweight is also summarised. The literature is also reviewed in respect to the mechanisms in the pathway between the placenta and the fetus, and in respect to recent work suggesting a link between birthweight and disease in adult life. This thesis examines factors that influence birthweight and placental weight. Birthweight for gestational age percentile curves for the New Zealand population were firstly defined. small for gestational age (SGA) infants could then be categorised. The thesis considers two sources of data, the first a cross-sectional sample of the New Zealand population from 1987 to 1990 (the control subjects of the New Zealand cot Death study, a national case-control study on sudden infant death syndrome), and the second a hospital population in Auckland (National Womens Hospital (l992)). These two datasets are investigated to determine factors that influence birthweight in a univariate situation and then in the multivariate situation. Independent variables are considered using a priori categorisations and where appropriate Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) derived categorisations determined by producing plots of the quantiles of cases versus controls. A number of variables under the headings of socio-demographic, lifestyle, genetic, obstetric and nutrition are examined and found to be associated with the outcomes of interest at the univariate level. After controlling in multivariate analyses a number of variables are found to be no longer significant, however some show strong relationships. The variable relating to smoking in both datasets shows the greatest detrimental effect on the outcomes considered in respect to birthweight. This confirms that in New Zealand, as in other places in the world, smoking has significant consequences on birthweight. The data is also investigated for the timing of insult to the fetus from smoking, and is found to be most important during pregnancy. comparison of the results comparing those obtained using a binary outcome for SGA, and those obtained using birthweight continuously, show relatively consistent results. The odds ratios and the decreases in birthweight obtained from both datasets show a relatively linear relationship between the two. An examination into whether a distinct group of individuals exists in respect to having large placentae for birthweight, indentified an artefact in the dataset relating to recording of placental weight for twins. After removal of twins from the dataset, examination of factors that influence placental weight showed that the factors that influence placental weight are not the same as those that influence birthweight. In particular smoking is found not to influence placental weight, and haemoglobin, which has no influence on birthweight, is found to be inversely associated with placental weight. other factors such as parity are found to influence placental weight in the same proportion in which birthweight is affected. In conclusion this thesis shows that factors investigated in New Zealand are consistent with findings in the international literature in relation to birthweight. The results on factors that influence placental weight add to the international literature on a topic on which little work has been carried out. The results of this thesis point to areas where future research needs to be carried out, in particular in relation to maternal nutrition during pregnancy and maternal energy expenditure during pregnancy. There is also a need for further research into the relationships of factors on placental weight and the ratio of birthweight to placental weight, and how these relationships affect health outcomes in childhood and adult life.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3250</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of the foetal adrenal glands in the mechanism of initiation of parturition in the ewe</field><field name="creator">Liggins, Graham Collingwood</field><field name="description">Pregnancy in the sheep, as in other mammals, has a genetically-determined species-specific duration.

The work of this thesis is an attempt to elucidate some of the factors responsible for ensuring that at the appropriate time the uterus of the pregnant sheep expels its contents. From a review of existing publications it is obvious that the factors influencing gestation length in sheep are poorly understood and that the mechanism of initiation of parturition is unknown. It is fruitless to try to apply knowledge gained in other species to the solution of the problem; among the multitude of hypotheses, none has proved acceptable as a complete description of the events which culminate in parturition in a particular species let alone as a basis secure enough to permit extrapolation to sheep.</field><field name="date">1969</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand's London: The metropolis and New Zealand's culture, 1890-1940</field><field name="creator">Barnes, Felicity</field><field name="description">The role of London in forming New Zealand&#8217;s culture and identity is a significant feature of New Zealand&#8217;s cultural history that has, until now, been overlooked.  Ties with London and with &#8216;Home&#8217; generally, have received little study, and &#8216;Britishness&#8217; in New Zealand is largely considered a legacy of demography to be eventually outgrown.  This thesis suggests something different.  During the period 1890-1940, technology changed cultural perceptions of time and space, and it changed the relationship between metropole and former colony too.  These technologies drew New Zealand and London closer together.  London was constructed as an active part of the New Zealand cultural landscape, rather than as a nostalgic remnant of a predominantly British-born settler population.  London was New Zealand&#8217;s metropolis too, with consequences for the way New Zealand culture was shaped.  This thesis considers the cultural impact of London using four tropes linked to those changing perceptions of time and space.  &#8216;Greater New Zealand&#8217; is concerned with space, whilst &#8216;&#8220;New&#8221; New Zealand&#8217; is concerned with time.  &#8216;London&#8217;s Farm&#8217; and the &#8216;Imaginative Hinterland&#8217; consider propinquity and simultaneity respectively.  Each theme draws from different bases of evidence in order to suggest London&#8217;s broad impact.  Collectively, they argue for a shift away from a core and periphery relationship, towards one better described as a city and hinterland relationship.  This approach draws upon existing national, imperial, and cultural historiography, whilst at the same time questioning some of their conventions and conceptions.  New Zealand as hinterland challenges the conceptual borders of &#8216;national history&#8217;, exploring the transnational nature of cultural formations that otherwise have been considered as autochthonous New Zealand (or for that matter, British) developments.  At the same time, whilst hinterlands may exist as part of empire, they are not necessarily products of it.  Nor are they necessarily formed in opposition to the metropole, even though alterity is often used to explain colonial relationships.  &#8216;New Zealand&#8217;s London&#8217; is, instead a reciprocal creation.  Its shared cultural landscape is specific, but at the same time, it offers an alternative means for understanding other white settler colonies.  Like New Zealand, their cultural histories may be more complex cultural constructions than national or imperial stories allow.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">empire</field><field name="subject">London</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effect of Substrate Parameters on the Morphology of Thermally Sprayed PEEK Splats</field><field name="creator">Withy, Benjamin Paul</field><field name="description">Thermal spray is a well established technology that is commonly used in the aerospace and automotive industries.  This thesis reports on the effect that substrate surface chemistry, morphology and temperature has on the morphology of PEEK single splats on aluminium substrates.  PEEK single splats were deposited by HVAF and plasma spraying on aluminium substrates with 6 different pretreatments.  Substrates were either sprayed at room temperature, or 323&#176;C, and a subset of substrates was held at incremental temperatures up to 363&#176;C.  HVAF deposited splats on room temperature substrates showed sensitivity to surface chemistry, with increased circularity and area associated with low levels of hydroxide and chemisorbed water on the aluminium surface.  Substrates held at 323&#176;C were more sensitive to substrate morphology, where rough surfaces resulted in decreased circularity and area apparently independent of surface chemistry.  Substrate temperature trials revealed a significant step in the results, equating to greater circularity, and lower splat area, perimeter and Feret diameter.  This step occurred between 123&#176;C and 163&#176;C, the two points bracketing the glass transition temperature of PEEK (143&#176;C).  This result  was due to the relaxation of splats deposited on surfaces above 143&#176;C, whilst splats on cooler substrates quench through the glass transition and do not relax.  PEEK splats deposited by plasma spray on room temperature and 323&#176;C substrates showed sensitivity to the amount of hydroxide and chemisorbed water present on the aluminium substrates, with low levels resulting in more circular and larger area splats.  Plasma splats did not show the same temperature effects as HVAF splats, thought to be due to the more molten state of plasma splats upon impact compared to the HVAF splats.  The primary conclusions reached were that plasma sprayed polymers were sensitive to surface chemistry, and that as such the surface chemistry of a substrate should be considered when forming plasma spray polymer coatings.  It was also concluded that the kinetic energy of particles in HVAF thermal spray contributed significantly to the thermal energy of a particle on impact, allowing for improved splat properties without overheating the particles in flight.  Finally it was concluded that substrate temperature is far more important for HVAF thermal spray of polymers than plasma spray of polymers, but that it improves splat properties for both techniques.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thermal Spray</field><field name="subject">Surface Chemistry</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291400 Materials Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3382</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of ductile endurance of earthquake resisting steel members</field><field name="creator">Hyland, Clark</field><field name="description">This thesis provides a structural and materials engineering explanation for many of the running fractures that occurred in steel structures during the destructive Kobe and Northridge earthquakes in the mid 1990s.  A method is developed that allows the ductile endurance of structural steel members subjected to cyclic plastic deformation during earthquakes to be assessed and for pre-necking running fractures to be avoided.  The study commenced following the 2000 World Earthquake Conference in Auckland.  The conference brought together the findings of the huge research effort, in America, Japan, Europe and New Zealand, that followed the Kobe and Northridge earthquakes.  The running fractures that had occurred in steel structures represented an unpredicted failure mode that structural engineers have not known how to predict or suppress through the engineering design process.  A clear fundamental understanding of the causes and how to prevent the fractures did not arise from the conference. In fact apparently conflicting results were reported.  Full scale cyclic tests in New Zealand on structural assemblies had not resulted in running fractures, whereas tests in American and Japan had.  Structural engineers designing earthquake resistant structures rely on constructional steel to be materially homogeneous and nominally tri-linear in behaviour.  Steel is expected to behave elastically under regular in-service loading, have a reliable and flat yield stress-strain characteristic, and under overload then develop predictable levels of strain-hardening in conjunction with significant plastic elongation up to its ultimate tensile strength.  Steel is expected to eventually fracture after further plastic elongation and necking.  Ductile design strategies and methods utilise the plastic elongation characteristics of steel to protect structures in earthquake.  Plastic deformation is considered to beneficially dissipate energy generated in the structure by a severe earthquake and also dampen the structure&#8217;s response.  The occurrence of running fracture without significant cyclic plastic deformation and before section necking in steelwork, therefore undermines the basis of the ductile seismic design approach. The initial part of the thesis is devoted to bringing together the fundamental aspects of materials engineering related to fracture of constructional steel.  This is intended to provide a bridge of knowledge for structural engineering practitioners and researchers not fully conversant with materials engineering aspects of fracture.  Fracture behaviour in steel is a broad and complex topic that developed rapidly in the twentieth century driven by the demands of technological growth.  The unexpected fracture of welded liberty ships at sea in World War 2; the need for reliable long term containment for the nuclear reactors in the 1950s and 1960s; and prevention of fatigue failures in aircraft frames since the 1950s all drove engineering research into steel fracture behaviour.  There are many subtle variations in definitions in the published literature on fracture that can be confusing.  Therefore an attempt has been made to clarify terminology.  The term brittle fracture in particular is only used in this thesis as applying to running fracture when the general or far field tensile stresses are below the yield stress of the steel.  The term pre-necking or running fracture is preferred to describe the condition more broadly which may occur prior to and also after general yielding, but before section necking.  Running fracture is a manifestation of pre-necking fracture in which insufficient plastic flow is available in the assembly to absorb the energy released upon fracture. The experimental studies investigated the behaviour of constructional steel commonly used in New Zealand, at various levels of plastic strain.  This started with Charpy V-Notch (CVN) testing which revealed that a significant transition temperature shift and curve shape change occurs with increasing plastic strain and the associated strain-hardening.   This showed that the ability of steel to avoid pre-necking or running fracture reduces as the level of plastic strain-hardening increases. Temperature controlled Crack Tip Opening Displacement (CTOD) testing was then undertaken. The setting of testing temperatures for the CTOD tests were guided by review of the CVN test results, using published CVN to fracture toughness correlation methods.  However running cleavage fractures developed in the CTOD specimens at higher than predicted temperatures of 10 oC and 20 oC.  These are typical service temperatures for structures in New Zealand and so are very likely to occur at the time of an earthquake. The implication from this is that there are levels of strain-hardening and conditions of material notching constraint that can lead to pre-necking and running fracture in New Zealand fabricated steel structures, under severe earthquake loading. Care was taken in the CTOD testing to monitor and maximise the capture of data electronically using a specially developed Direct Current Potential Drop method.  This allowed the test results to be analysed and considered in varying ways, leading to a consistent assessment of the CTOD, crack growth, and the specific work of fracture in each test piece.  While CTOD test results have sometimes been published by structural and welding engineering researchers in the wake of Kobe and Northridge, the results were typically of little use for this study as the CTOD initiation point was generally not identified effectively.  The effect of remote plastic flow in the specimens was also not adequately accounted for.  The CTOD test results were often simply used to help correlate other factors observed by the researchers.  Side-grooving of specimens was not reported as having been used in any of the published results reviewed.  When conducting CTOD test with highly ductile constructional steels it is very difficult to get useful CTOD results if the specimens are not side-grooved, as significant necking and tunnelling will otherwise occur and limit the usefulness of the results. Work by Knott and also by McRobie and Smith was seminal in terms of identifying some critical aspects of plane strain development in CTOD tests, and the links to non-metallic particle density with respect to fracture toughness and CTOD at initiation. Some of their findings with regards to the effect of pre-strain on CTOD initiation were subsequently found to confirm the experimental findings in this study. No effective methodology for prediction of pre-necking or running fracture in a structural member or assembly when subjected to gross plastic cyclic deformation was found to exist in the literature.  It was concluded however that the principles of specific work of fracture, and monotonic and cyclic fracture similitude were particularly relevant.  These were therefore utilised in the development of the design method proposed in this thesis.  The CTOD test results were reviewed, isolating the remote plastic flow component, to determine the critical specific work of fracture property Rc of the steels tested. A meeting with Professor Kuwamura at the University of Tokyo was providential, allowing discussion of his similitude principle, and observations in person of some of the fractured specimens developed during his full scale test series&#8217;.  Running fractures with cleavage were evident in the specimens, with their tell-tale chevron markings. He had predicted running fracture problems in structures in Japan ahead of the Kobe earthquake and been largely ignored.  His insights were subsequently seriously considered in Japan after the earthquake. He and his colleagues developed the principle of structural similitude that relates monotonic fracture displacement ductility to cyclic fracture displacement ductility for a particular assembly.  This arose from their observation that running fractures developed from ductile crack formation at blunt notches in structures.  The similitude principle has echoes of the Coffin-Manson approach to ductile crack initiated low cycle fracture.  The principle of similitude has a log&#8211;log relationship as does the Manson-Coffin relationship.  So where notch plasticity controls the initiation of fracture in a structural assembly it is conceptually reasonable to expect that the number of cycles to initiation of fracture from a notch will have a log&#8211;log relationship to the amplitude of the cyclic strain developed in the notch. Kuwamura found that steel assemblies with lower CVN energy had reduced cyclic fracture endurance than the same assemblies made with steel with higher CVN impact energy.  However no method of predicting performance of any particular assembly could be developed from his observations.  The benefit of his method primarily relates to the minimising of testing necessary to assess the fracture limited cyclic displacement ductility of a structural assembly.  However it doesn&#8217;t provide a means for designing a structural assembly to achieve specific levels of ductile endurance other than clearly identifying the need to use steel with good CVN characteristics. The most significant development arising from this thesis is therefore the development of a design method to assess cyclic ductile endurance.  The method utilises the specific work of fracture properties obtained from CTOD specimens of the steel in conjunction with a relatively simple fracture mechanics assessment and an elasto-plastic finite element analysis (FEA).  The FEA model is used to determine the displacement ductility of the assembly at the calculated onset of pre-necking fracture.  The elasto-plastic stress&#8211;strain properties of the steel in various pre-strain states required for the FEA may be derived from tensile testing.  Kuwamura&#8217;s similitude principle is then used to predict cyclic plastic endurance at various constant displacement ductility amplitudes.  The method is extended using Miner&#8217;s rule to allow for the effects of increasing variable amplitude cyclic plastic loading. In summary the thesis explains why pre-necking and running fractures occur in steel members subjected to cyclic plastic deformation during a severe earthquake.  In addition a method for consistently assessing the ability of structural steel assemblies to achieve a specified level of ductile endurance during earthquakes is proposed.  The method is verified against published results for a cyclic test of a simple steel member with a crack at mid-span.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fracture mechanics</field><field name="subject">structures</field><field name="subject">constructional steel</field><field name="subject">seismic</field><field name="subject">specific work of fracture</field><field name="subject">CTOD</field><field name="subject">charpy v-notch</field><field name="subject">finite element analysis</field><field name="subject">similitude</field><field name="subject">manson-coffin</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3381</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the role of Customers and other external influencers in radical new product development &#8211; a network approach</field><field name="creator">Joseph, Richard</field><field name="description">The broad objective of this thesis is to extend our understanding of radical new product development (NPD) beyond degree of customer orientation (CO) by assessing the role and influence of both customers and other external influencers (OEIs). While a number of studies have investigated the relationship between CO and NPD outcomes, such studies typically focus on incremental NPD. The role of customers is also typically investigated using numerical scales to understand degree of CO, and fails to consider the important implementation issues of which, when and how customers are involved through the NPD process. In addition to customers, other external influencers (OEIs) such as investors, suppliers, distributors, competitors, universities and advisors are also increasingly involved in radical NPD, but the roles and actual influence of these different groups is unclear. To address these gaps in the literature this thesis adopts a network approach to investigate the role of customers and OEIs in the development of six radical new products. Six retrospective case studies are conducted, all involving the development of radical ICT products targeted at industrial markets. To provide further insight, three of these cases involve successful new products while the remaining three involve unsuccessful products. Analysis of case data involves qualitative and quantitative network analysis as well as thematic analysis of interview transcripts. Clear differences are found between the ways in which the successful and unsuccessful cases involve customers and OEIs. For example, firms developing successful products focus on existing customers with whom they have strong previous relationships, while developers of unsuccessful products do not. Furthermore, the successful cases all involve customers actively as co-developers of the product, while none of the unsuccessful cases take this approach. These findings are presented in detail and discussed in relation to the existing literature. A set of empirically-based propositions are outlined as a foundation for future research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">radical new product development (NPD)</field><field name="subject">customer orientation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3397</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Natural products from New Zealand Latrunculia species sponges</field><field name="creator">Grkovic, Tanja</field><field name="description">In a survey of the secondary metabolite chemistry profiles of ten New Zealand, one Antarctic and one South African-sourced collections of Latrunculia spp. sponges, eighteen discorhabdin alkaloids have been isolated. Four of those, namely discorhabdin K, 3-dihydro discorhabdin A, 1-thiomethyl discorhabdin G*/I, and 16a,17a-dehydro discorhabdin W were fully characterized as new natural products in the series. In addition, for the first time, five enantiomeric pairs and two sets of diastereomers of the naturallyoccurring discorhabdin alkaloids were identified. The absolute configuration of all of the chiral compounds isolated, including new natural products, has been established upon comparison of the observed experimental data with the results of time dependant density functional theory calculations of the electronic circular dichroism spectra. A structure activity relationship study on discorhabdin B, the main natural product of the Wellington-sourced sponges, has identified four reactive centres on the molecule and yielded nine novel semi-synthetic derivatives. Consequently, a new discorhabdin biosynthetic tree was proposed which highlighted discorhabdin B as a crucial precursor to a number of other naturally-occurring analogues. The importance of the iminoquinone moiety and the spirodienone ring with respect to the bioactivity of the compounds in a range of naturally-occurring discorhabdins was demonstrated. A new semi-synthetic derivative, 1-discorhabdyl discorhabdin D, was identified as a potent anti-malarial agent and has opened new possibilities for the therapeutic development of the discorhabdin alkaloids.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3376</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Auckland suburbs coronary study</field><field name="creator">Fraser, Gary E.</field><field name="description">The Auckland Suburbs Coronary Study is designed to provide information concerning acute coronary events in Auckland. Within New Zealand, information Previously depended on either hospital data or death certificate data. The present study is community based and has provided more extensive information than has previously been available. A random sample of 125 primary care doctors was selected. The patients of these doctors were considered a random sample of the community and formed the study population. The size of this population was estimated using a postal survey, taking names from the electoral roll. A statistical theory is developed to allow a confidence interval to be placed about the maximum likelihood estimate. Hypothesis testing theory is applied to the problem of comparing disease frequencies at different locations or at different times at the same location. During overlapping one year periods, 293 cases of definite myocardial infarction, 178 cases of sudden cardiac death and 99 cases of possible myocardial infarction were collected. Information concerning demographic variables, past and prodromal medical histories, the acute event, the electrocardiograph, cardiac enzymes, mortality within 28 days and postmortem results, was collected As about 80% of sudden deaths are all over before any help is sought and in view of the geographic nature of Auckland city the utility of &#8216;cardiac arrest&#8217; ambulances would not seem to be great. For sudden deaths surviving longer than five minutes after onset (about 50% of total) there was a significant tendency for there to be a lower social class predominance. This may imply inadequacies of acute health care--either availability or notification. Persons dying suddenly differed from persons experiencing definite myocardial infarction (but not dying suddenly) by experiencing less prodromal chest pain, taking digoxin and frusemide more frequently, consuming more alcohol and the acute event occurring in the cooler months proportionately more often. At postmortem, they had significantly more myocardial scarring and/or fibrosis. Persons experiencing definite myocardial infarction differed from persons experiencing possible myocardial infarction (who did not die suddenly) by being more likely a male, having less history of past acute coronary insufficiency, using less of beta-blocking drugs or frusemide/ethacrynic acid and describing prodromal lethargy less frequently. Clinical shock was more common in the acute phase and death more common in the succeeding 30 days. Persons dying suddenly differed from those suffering possible myocardial infarction (but not dying suddenly) by being older, more likely to be male and less likely to have had chest pain in the prodrome. The data could be interpreted as suggesting that a separate primary myocardial process is contributing towards sudden death. Alcohol may be a risk factor for sudden death. A hypothesis is, that in the presence of acute infarction, a history of chronic, moderate to high alcohol intake is associated with an increased likelihood of sudden death.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3289</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Development and efficacy of cognitive behaviour therapy for multiple sclerosis fatigue: a randomised controlled trial</field><field name="creator">Van Kessel, Kirsten</field><field name="description">Aim Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an unpredictable demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), with fatigue being one of the least understood symptoms. Based on a systematic review of the literature, a cognitive behavioural model of MS fatigue was developed and used to design a manualised eight session cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) intervention to treat MS fatigue. The purpose of the randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to investigate the efficacy of CBT compared to relaxation training (RT) to treat fatigue in MS. Methods Seventy-two patients with MS fatigue were randomly assigned to either eight sessions of CBT or eight sessions of RT, designed to control for therapist time and attention. Participants were assessed before and after treatment, and at three and six months follow-up. Primary outcomes included the Fatigue Questionnaire (FQ) and the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGIS). Secondary outcomes included measures of fatigue related impairment, mood, stress, sleep problems and daytime sleepiness. Seventy of the 72 participants completed all therapy sessions and 69 participants completed all assessments. Results Analyses were carried out by intention-to-heat. There was a significant group by time interaction for fatigue, indicating that the CBT group had significantly greater reductions in fatigue severity than the RT group (p&lt;.02). A-priori contrasts showed that this significant effect was largely accounted for by changes between baseline and end of treatment (P&lt;.00). By six month follow-up improvement in fatigue was equivalent in both groups. The key mechanism of improvement in fatigue severity during CBT was a positive change in schematic beliefs about fatigue. At the end of treatment 88.6% of the CBT group rated themselves as improved compared to 73% of the RT group, but this difference was not significant (p&lt;.09). Both groups improved on almost all secondary outcomes, with the CBT participants improving more significantly on depression, anxiety and stress between baseline and end of treatment (p&lt;.05). Conclusions CBT appears to be an effective treatment for MS fatigue, with CBT participants improving significantly more on fatigue than RT participants between baseline and end of treatment. Obtained effect sizes for fatigue in both CBT and RT were considerably larger than those in previous controlled trials of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Both groups improved on almost all of the secondary outcomes. Findings support the relevance of a cognitive behavioural model for MS fatigue.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gap junctions in the lens: is location everything?</field><field name="creator">Sisley, Aran Mathew George</field><field name="description">The primary function of the ocular lens is as a light-focusing structure. To this end the lens is avascular, with a highly ordered arrangement of cells that acts to reduce light scattering. However, the avascular nature of the lens presents the problem of supplying cells deep within the lens with nutrients and removing waste products of cellular metabolism, i.e. maintaining cellular homeostasis, To solve this problem the lens possesses intercellular channels, called gap junctions, that facilitate cell-to-cell communication and are regulated by changes in the subcellular distribution and age dependent processing of the gap junction protein subunits, called connexins. The lens expresses three types of connexins (Cx): Cx43 in the anterior surface epithelial cells and connexins 46 and 50 in the fibre cells. Therefore, to fully examine the role of GJs in lens homeostasis, regional differences in GJ structure and function need to be quantified. In this thesis I present the results of experiments designed to map the differentiation dependent changes to subcellular distribution and posttranslational processing of Cx46 and Cx50 in mouse and rat lenses. My results quantitatively show for the first time that Cx50 undergoes two discrete cleavage events in a similar manner to that previously shown for Cx46, and that qualitatively Cx46 does the same in the mouse lens' Such posttranslational processing has important effects on the proposed lens circulation model (Mathias et al., 1997) that accounts for lens homeostasis. In addition, I have examined the functional contribution of gap junctions to localized intercellular communication in different regions of wildtype and Cx46-KO mouse lenses, using highly localised uncaging of fluorescein with Two-Photon Excited Flash Photolysis (TPEFP) in half lenses, The results of these experiments have provided the first supporting evidence for a macromolecule-permeable pathway, previously suggested by Shestoplaov and Bassnett (2000, 2003), that acts in conjunction with gap junctions to facilitate intercellular communication in the lens core. My results show that this pathway acts at a localised level to confer cell-to-cell communication that is as effective as that mediated by gap junctions, and therefore a re-evaluation of current models of lens homeostasis is now required.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320600 Medical Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3292</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intrauterine growth retardation in the rat: effects on the somatotrophic axis and postnatal sequelae</field><field name="creator">Woodall, Sonja Mary</field><field name="description">Over the past decade, a number of epidemiological studies have provided significant evidence that certain major adult noncommunicable diseases, such as hypertension, ischaemic heart disease and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, may be associated with impaired fetal growth. This phenomenon has been termed "programming" which is essentially the term used for persisting changes in structure and function caused by undernutrition or other adverse influences acting during critical periods of early development. Programming has been used as the mechanistic basis to explain the long term sequelae of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). The mechanisms underlying the epidemiological observations remain to be elucidated and developed. While it is well established that severe maternal undernutrition during pregnancy leads to IUGR, there has been relatively little well defined animal studies of the somatotrophic axis and postnatal development of growth retarded offspring. The major objectives of this thesis were to establish a model in the rat of IUGR by nutritional restriction of the dam throughout gestation and to examine the effects of fetal growth retardation on endocrine, molecular and growth parameters during postnatal development. In addition, the development of an animal model for IUGR enabled well defined studies testing distinct hypotheses suggested by the epidemiological observations of professor David Barker and colleagues. Timed matings were performed in Wistar rats and dams were randomly assigned to one of two dietary treatment groups. A control group was fed ad libitum throughout pregnancy and a restricted group was fed 30% of ad libitum intake. Restricted fed dams were observed to lose a significant amount of body weight throughout gestation, due to undernutrition, but caught up to the ad libitum group during the lactating period. Maternal undernutrition significantly reduced fetal and placental weights without altering litter size. Postnatally, body weights of offspring from undernourished dams continued to be reduced until at least 18 weeks of age, although they were observed to be growing at the same rate as ad libitum offspring by 2 weeks of age. A cohort of animals from undernourished dams were maintained to measure blood pressure by tail cuff plethysmography. Offspring from undernourished dams were found to have significantly elevated systolic blood pressures from 18 weeks of age. This observation provides direct experimental support for the hypothesis, derived from human epidemiological studies, that the origin of adult hypertension may originate during fetal life as a result of exposure to a sub-optimal intrauterine environment. Parallel reductions in plasma IGF-I and hepatic IGF-I mRNA concentrations before 15 days of age were also observed in growth retarded offspring. Hepatic IGF-I transcription start sites within exon 1 and exon 2 were coordinately reduced with IUGR up to 15 days of age without changes in GHR and GHBP mRNA abundance. The lack of catch-up growth observed in the IUGR offspring despite normalization of their plasma IGF-I and IGF-I mRNA levels from 15 days of age may be due to a state of partial resistance to GH. This observation lead to a series of treatment studies in which neonatal and juvenile offspring from ad libitum and undernourished dams were treated with growth factors to investigate somatic growth responses as a measure for hormone sensitivity. In both treatment studies, ad libitum offspring from both age groups and juvenile IUGR offspring responded to GH treatment However, neonatal IUGR offspring did not exhibit any response to GH treatment.. Analysis of IGF-I gene expression in neonatal offspring showed that GH treatment elevated IGF-I Eb mRNA in ad libitum but not IUGR offspring. These results suggest a possible mechanism for transient GH resistance in that a post-receptor defect in GH action may contribute to the development of temporary postnatal GH resistance as a consequence of IUGR and fetal programming of IGF-I gene expression. In summary, the development of a model of IUGR in the rat using maternal undernutrition throughout gestation has enabled detailed investigation of nutritional regulation of the somatotrophic axis during fetal development and postnatal sequelae. The studies in this thesis have shown that the somatotrophic axis is markedly altered postnatally by nutritional restriction of the dam throughout gestation, leading to prolonged postnatal growth retardation and elevated blood pressure The mechanisms which lead to the induction of such fetal programming and whether these changes may contribute to the development of subsequent adult-onset disease remain to be addressed in future studies.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3314</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Psychological investigations of the experience of chronic pain</field><field name="creator">James, Frances Ruth</field><field name="description">This thesis is based on two theoretical models of chronic illness: Large, Butler, James, and Peters (1990) introduced a systems model of musculo-skeletal pain which incorporated many of the variables believed to be important in the development and maintenance of pain. Feldman&#8217;s model (1974) addressed the difficulties of adapting to chronic illness. Five studies evaluated specific aspects of these models. The epidemiology of pain in New Zealand (NZ) was derived from a psychiatric epidemiology project. Approximately 80% of NZ adults had experienced a life disrupting episode of pain which had required medical consultation. Subjects who reported episodes of pain were more likely to have psychiatric diagnoses of anxiety, depression, and phobia. They were more likely to describe their health as poor and were currently consulting their doctor more than people who did not report an experience of pain. The estimated average cost of health consulting by people attending Auckland Hospital Pain Clinic (AHPC) for the previous year was $1333(NZ). Most people had some subsidy of costs. The health consulting of the AHPC group was higher than that reported in the NZ health literature. Self image and the experience of pain were assessed in two studies. The first asked subjects at AHPC to describe the typical thoughts, feelings, and behaviours, of someone with chronic pain. Subjects described loss of self esteem, alienation from family and friends, fear of the future, frustration and anger. The descriptions focused on psychological aspects of the experience of pain. The second study of self image used repertory grid technique. Two standardised Illness Self Construct Repertory Grids (ISCRG) were evaluated. Issues in the use of standardised grids are discussed and some aspects of ISCRG application are explored. The two ISCRG indicated subjects often identified themselves as a physically ill person and felt isolated from others. People with pain and their "closest other&#8221; (CO) completed the ISCRG(A) and questionnaires on the quality of their relationship. Closest others overestimated the role of the physical illness in their partners&#8217; life and believed that they understood them better than the individual with pain thought they did. The personality dimensions of alexithymia and hypnotisability have been hypothesised as pathways for the development of psychosomatic illness. Individuals with chronic pain were tested to establish whether they weremore alexithymic and more hypnotisable than subjects in a general population control group. This was not verified. The constructs of alexithymia and hypnotisability require critical examination. The experience of pain is common and is associated with psychological distress and high health service use. Self construct appears to be a major factor determining response to pain and to treatment programmes. Chronic pain appears to be a particular challenge for individuals who must accept alteration in their lifestyle with perhaps little understanding of what the future may hold.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321021 Psychiatry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3291</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Purinergic signalling in peripheral auditory neurotransmission</field><field name="creator">Salih, Salam Gheyath Al-Din</field><field name="description">P2X receptors, forming ATP-gated ion channels, mediate fast neurotransmission in the central, peripheral and autonomic nervous systems. Preliminary evidence indicated the presence of P2X receptors in the cochlea, with a possible involvement in the neurohumoral regulation of hearing function. This study investigated the hypothesis that extracellular ATP acts as an auditory neurotransmitter or neuromodulator within the inner ear. RT-PCR analysis of rat spiral ganglion neurones (SGN), which innervate the sensory hair cells of the cochlea, detected the expression of three different isoforms of the P2X2 receptor subunit, including a novel functional isoform (designated P2X2-3R). Cellular localisation of the P2X2R subunit mRNA in SGN somata was demonstrated by direct in situ RT-PCR. Furthermore, immunocytochemistry studies using P2X2 receptor-specific antisera, confirmed the expression of the P2X2R protein by SGN somata, and also showed localisation at the region of spiral ganglion neurone synapse with the inner and outer hair cells. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings from cultured post-natal rat SGN demonstrated ATP-activated currents with heterogeneous phenotypes. This is consistent with the functional expression of P2X2R subunit isoforms, and co-expression of additional P2X receptor subunits. However, in situ recordings, using a rat cochlear slice preparation, demonstrated a homogeneous phenotype of ATP-gated current, suggesting heteromultimeric assembly of P2X receptor subunits that is specifically regulated in vivo. Employing a multi-disciplinary approach, the present study provides substantial evidence for a purinergic mode of neurotransmission within the peripheral auditory system. This occurs via ATP-gated ion channels in spiral ganglion neurones, arising from a tightly regulated expression of a specific P2X receptor phenotype.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3316</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Myocardial force and intracellular Ca2+ in an animal model of hypertensive heart failure</field><field name="creator">Ward, Marie-Louise</field><field name="description">Hypertensive heart failure has long been associated with diminished cardiac contractile function, yet the underlying cellular mechanisms are not well understood. The aim of this Thesis was to investigate the relationship between intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) and isometric force during the relatively narrow time frame in which long-standing compensated hypertrophy progresses to decompensated end-stage heart failure in an animal model of human essential hypertension. In order to carry out this aim, left ventricular trabeculae were utilized from failing hearts of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and their normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) controls. At a physiological stimulation frequency (5 Hz), and temperature (37 &#176;C), the peak stress of SHR trabeculae was significantly reduced compared to WKY, although no differences in the time-course of the twitch were detected. Measurements using fura-2/AM as an index of intracellular [Ca2+] showed that, for SHR, both the peak of the Ca2+ transient and the resting [Ca2+]i were increased and the decay of the Ca2+ transient was prolonged compared to WKY. This unexpected result, i.e. depression of twitch force despite an increased Ca2+ transient, was investigated further by utilizing experimental protocols known to affect [Ca2+]i and force. Varying extracellular calcium ([Ca2+]o) between 0.5 and 5 mM showed that the reduction of force development by SHR trabeculae was not associated with reduced myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity, since, although peak [Ca2+]i continued to increase with increasing [Ca2+]o, peak stress reached a plateau. Investigation of the force-frequency response between 0.2 and 10 Hz showed that the mismatch in peak Ca2+ and peak force was apparent across all frequencies for SHR. A consistent finding of studies that have made measurement of [Ca2+]i in failing myocardium is that the decay of intracellular Ca2+ following SR release is prolonged. Additionally, expression levels of the SR Ca2+ -ATPase have been reported as reduced, in conjunction with increased expression of the sarcolemmal Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. Although the decay of fluorescence was slower for SHR in this study, no experimental evidence was found to suggest that sarcolemmal Ca2+ extrusion was increased in SHR in comparison to WKY. The re-circulation fraction of activator Ca2+ during recovery from potentiation was not different between rat strains, indicating that SL Ca2+ extrusion was not increased in SHR. Additionally, the decay of fluorescence remained slower for SHR even when the SR Ca2+ -ATPase contribution was functionally removed. Inhibition of the SL Ca2+ -ATPase, together with the functional removal of the SR, removed the differences in the decay of fluorescence between rat strains. A decrease in the sarcolemmal extrusion of [Ca2+]i by the Ca2+ -.ATPase might therefore explain the observed differences in the resting [Ca2+]i and in the amplitude of the Ca2+ transient between rat strains. In summary, this study has provided the first measurements of [Ca2+]i and isometric force carried out at physiological temperature and stimulation frequency in LV trabeculae from failing SHR hearts and their age-matched, normotensive, WKY controls. Most importantly, for this animal model the contractile dysfunction typical of heart failure is not associated with reduced availabilty of [Ca2+]i. Instead it is suggested that contractile function is compromised in these LV trabeculae by the increased collagen, and its three-dimensional organisation.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320600 Medical Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3294</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accounting information cues and share price revisions</field><field name="creator">Emanuel, D.M (David Munroe), 1944-</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the impact of certain identifiable subsets of accounting information on users&#8217; decisions by examining share price revisions that occurred at the same time as the accounting information was released. The subsets examined are the announcements of new share issues, the release of contemporaneous earnings and dividend announcements, and the release of information about asset revaluations. Assuming that an adequate methodology can be designed, a significant share price revision is consistent with the notion that the accounting information cue has "information content". The distinction between accounting research and research in the basic disciplines of economics and mathematics/statistics is the emphasis in accounting on the institutional domain; that is research in accounting requires a "mapping" into the institutional domain in which accounting information is produced and used. This, in turn, provides a justification for the type of announcement effect studies described in the previous paragraph. Clearly the study of share price revisions requires a substantial data base of share prices. Part of this thesis is devoted to a description of the procedures used to establish this data base. The three major announcement effect studies use what is popularly described as the market model residual method of analysis. In the application of this model, some attention has been paid to problems of "thin" trading in the New Zealand environment in providing unbiased estimators of the market model parameters. The results of the application of this methodology are that share prices seem to react rapidly and (generally) unbiasedly to the announcement of bonus issues and contemporaneous earnings and dividend announcements. The size of the reaction in the week that the announcement is made is typically large. The larger is the unexpected component in the announcement of earnings, the larger is the share price revision. With regard to rights issues, no abnormal share price performance was found in the week that the rights issue was announced, although it was clear that companies announcing rights issues had been performing abnormally well over the year up to the announcement. Share price revisions did not appear to accompany the release of information about the current values of assets (usually land and buildings). However it is conceded that this subset of the overall research exercise is more difficult to undertake as there are difficulties in determining an appropriate announcement date, and in determining what the market&#8217;s expectations are with regard to the revaluation.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350100 Accounting, Auditing and Accountability</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3319</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermoreception, thermoregulation and the early thermal environment</field><field name="creator">Young, Andrew</field><field name="description">Previous investigations1,2 have shown that the capacity of rats and rabbits reared at an elevated environmental temperature to thermoregulate in the cold is impaired. This impairment appears permanent and is associated with other thermoregulatory dysfunction (altered febrile response and altered response to intrahypothalamic noradrenaline injection). The present study investigated the role of the thermal environment in the development of thermoregulatory function by studying the performance of the intact thermoregulatory system and components thereof at different levels of processing of thermal information (thermoreceptive, early integrative and effector levels). The present study confirmed the impaired capacity of heat-reared rats to maintain colonic temperature in the cold and future indicated that this was likely to be attributable to active rather than passive components of the thermoregulatory system. Exposure to an environmental temperature of 20&#176;C for 20 days was able to prevent thermoregulatory dysfunction (as assessed by intrahypothalamic noradrenaline injection) if it occurred after about 14 days of age. Exposure to 20&#176;C was progressively less effective in averting thermoregulatory dysfunction after about 60-80 days of age. The experimental design identified these effects as being of environmental rather than genetic origin. Thermal information processing at the level of the caudal trigeminal nucleus resembled that described at thermoreceptors. The static and dynamic responses of thermoreceptive neurones at this level were quantified and found not to differ between 20&#176;C &#8211; and 30&#176;C-reared rats. The distribution of facial thermal receptive fields and the projections of these at the caudal trigeminal nucleus were mapped and also found not to differ. Thermal information originating from truncal skin was intercepted at a midline midbrain level. Data presented here suggested that the sites at which this thermal information could be intercepted included but probably were not restricted to the raphe nuclci. Both warm- and cold-responsive units were present at the midbrain. The abundance of thermoresponsive units was the same in 20&#176;C- and 30&#176;C-reared rat as was the ratio of warm:cold-responsive units. The stimulus configurations by which responses of midbrain thermoresponsive units could be characterised were more complex than at the caudal trigeminal nuclcus. Thermal responses were principally static with little response to temperature change. The pooled static responses of warm- and cold-responsive units over the 5-45&#176;C range were the same in 20&#176;C- and 30&#176;C-reared rats. The cutaneous receptive fields at the midbrain level were diffuse, covering most of the truncal surface. There was an almost universal and consistent interaction with noxious input at midbrain thermoresponsive units. Warm-responsive units were inhibited by simultaneous noxious stimulation at almost any body site while the activity of cold-responsive units was augmented by such stimulation. At the thermoeffector level, noradrenaline-induced thermogenesis was equal in 20&#176;C- and 30&#176;C- reared rats. Heat-rearing was not observed to produce identifiable effects on the peripheral processing of thermal information, either at the afferent or efferent limbs of the thermoregulatory system. Heat-rearing does however produce changes in thermophysiological responses that are primarily mediated via a central mechanism (responses to intrahypothalamic noradrenaline, febrile response). It is therefore surmised that alterations in thermoregulatory function following heat-rearing are attributable to changes in central rather than peripheral processing of thermal information. 1 Cooper et al., (1980) J Physiol [ Lond ] 303: 165-172 2 Ferguson et al., (1981) Can J Physiol Pharmacol 59: 91-95</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320600 Medical Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3293</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Significance testing in automatic interaction detection (A.I.D.)</field><field name="creator">Worsley, Keith John</field><field name="description">Automatic Interaction Detection (A.I.D.) is the name of a computer program, first used in the social sciences, to find the interaction between a set of predictor variables and a single dependent variable. The program proceeds in stages, and at each stage the categories of a predictor variable induce a split of the dependent variable into two groups, so that the between groups sum of squares ( BSS ) is a maximum. In this way, the optimum split defines the interaction between predictor and dependent variable, and the criterion BSS is taken as a measure of the explanatory power of the split. One of the strengths of A.I.D. is that this interaction is established without any reference to a specific model, and for this reason it is widely used in practice. However this strength is also its weakness; with no model there is no measure of its significance. Barnard (1974) has said: &#8220;&#8230; nowadays with more and more apparently sophisticated computer programs for social science, failure to take account of possible sampling fluctuations is leading to a glut of unsound analyses &#8230; I have in mind procedures such as A.I.D., the automatic interaction detector, which guarantees to get significance out of any data whatsoever. Methods of this kind require validation &#8230;&#8221; The aim of this thesis is to supply Part of that validation by investigating the null distribution of the optimum BSS for a single predictor at a single stage of A.I.D., so that the significance of any particular split can be judged. The problem of the overall significance of a complete A.I.D. analysis, combining many stages, still remains to be solved. In Chapter 1 the A.I.D. method is described in more detail and an example is presented to illustrate its use. A null hypothesis that the dependent variable observations have independent and identical normal distributions is proposed as a model for no interaction. In Chapters 2 and 3 the null distributions of the optimum BSS for a single predictor are derived and tables of percentage points are given. In Chapter 4 the normal assumption is dropped and non-parametric A.I.D. criteria, based on ranks, are proposed. Tables of percentage points, found by direct enumeration and by Monte Carlo methods, are given. In Chapter 5 the example presented in Chapter 1 is used to illustrate the application of the theory and tables in Chapters 2, 3 and 4 and some final conclusions are drawn.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3311</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiple-schedule performance in closed economies</field><field name="creator">Elliffe, Douglas Mark</field><field name="description">Experimental preparations may be divided into two categories, called open and closed economies. In an open economy, the extent to which the subject is deprived of the scheduled reinforcer, most commonly food, is controlled by the experimenter. This is usually done by manipulating the amount of free food given to the subject after each experimental session. Consumption of the reinforcer is thus independent of behaviour during the session. By contrast, in a closed economy, no alternative source of the reinforcer is available outside the session. Consumption of the reinforcer is thus completely determined by the subject&#8217;s interaction with the experimental environment. This may be done by having the subject live permanently within the experiment and receive all its food as reinforcers for responding on continuously available schedules. Most research in the experimental analysis of behaviour has been carried out within open economies, but it can be argued that the natural environment, as a whole, is better represented by a closed economy. Several experimental findings obtained within open economies have been shown not to be replicable within closed economies. In the present series of experiments, three pigeons received their total daily intake of food as reinforcers for responding on continuously available multiple variable-interval schedules. The relation between the allocation of responding between components of a multiple schedule and the distribution of reinforcers can be conveniently described by the generalised matching law, which states that the ratio of component response rates is a power function of the ratio of component reinforcer rates. In an open economy, the power, called sensitivity, is typically less than 1.0. This is called undermatching. Experiment 1 of the present series found sensitivity values substantially greater than 1.0.This is called overmatching. One procedural variable known to control sensitivity in open economies is level of deprivation. Experiments 2 to 5 examined the effect of deprivation in a closed economy. In Experiments 2 and 3, increasing deprivation by means of decreasing session duration produced decreases in sensitivity. In Experiment 4, increasing deprivation by decreasing overall reinforcer rate in continuous sessions had no effect on sensitivity. In Experiment 5, deprivation was held constant by changing session duration and overall reinforcer rate in opposite directions. Sensitivity increased with increasing session duration and decreasing overall reinforcer rate. Taken together, these results suggest that multiple-schedule sensitivity increases with decreasing deprivation, with decreasing overall reinforcer rate, and as the economy for reinforcers other than those arranged by the experimenter (extraneous reinforcers) becomes more closed. A quantitative model of multiple-schedule performance, elaborated from that of McLean and White (1983), was developed to account for these effects. In this model, response allocation is governed by the concurrent choice between scheduled-and extraneous-reinforcer rates within each component. The total rate of extraneous reinforcement is affected by both deprivation and economy, and the distribution of extraneous reinforcers between components depends inversely on the distribution of scheduled reinforcers. Unlike other published models, this model predicts overmatching in the present experiments. Quantitatively, the model accounts for both the present closed-economy data and published data from open-economy multiple schedules as well as does the generalised matching law, and better than does its most influential competitor, Herrnstein&#8217;s (1970) equation. Finally, it is proposed that, while the economy for scheduled reinforcers is important to understanding total response output on multiple schedules, the economy for extraneous reinforcers has much more influence on the allocation of that responding between components.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3312</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Models of electrocortical dynamics</field><field name="creator">Liley, David T.

Derived results exhibited a near linear relationship between the probability of a pyramidal cell firing and the extant value of the local field potential (LFP), similar to that seen in experimental studies involving cortical neurons. In contrast the continuum model considered neural tissue to be a continuous one-dimensional chain of excitatory and inhibitory neurons interacting by way of short (intra-cortical) and long (isotropic cortico-cortical) fibres. The defining non-linear integral equations were linearised such that Fourier-Laplace techniques could be applied to investigate potential solutions. Numerical solutions revealed the prescence of, spatially, weakly damped travelling waves at or near the frequencies of mammalian alpha (8-13 Hz). Biasing the excitatory cell population was shown to have a dominant effect in determining spatio-temporal damping of travelling wave solutions, whereas applying bias to the inhibitory cell population had a dominant effect in specifying the corresponding spatio-temporal frequencies. The possibility that such bias may be due to, and regulated by, subcortical efferents is discussed. Finally it is suggested that the alpha rhythm may be an important synchronising agent for coordinating widespread cortical activity.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3320</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High frequency power transistor model</field><field name="creator">Egan, Brian</field><field name="description">The development of a large-signal power transistor model applicable at radio frequencies is described. This model which has its basis in the classical large-signal models is valid for cut-off and active region operation but does not include saturation operation. The model is intended primarily for use in broadband linear radio frequency amplifier applications and is useful up to frequencies of the order of 1/15 f&#9516;. The model is described by two first order nonlinear differential equations and a number of algebraic equations. Equation coefficients are determined from measurements made on the devices under study. Two methods are described for the solution of the model equations. The first and principal method is an iterative one requiring computer assistance whilst the second is analytical and depends upon piecewise linearisation of the device transfer characteristic. This analytical method whilst in some respects inadequate, e.g. distortion level predictions, is easy to implement and despite its limitations affords useful insight into output power capability and frequency limitations of specific devices. The model contains all transistor nonlinearities and parasitic elements of significance and an important feature is the inclusion of device temperature as a model variable, resulting in good accuracy over a wide range of operating conditions. A simplified input impedance representation is evolved and it is demonstrated that input impedance measurements provide a useful window on model structure and aid in the evaluation of parameter values.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3321</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of some of the factors concerned in the natural regeneration of the kauri (Agathis australis)</field><field name="creator">Mirams, Rex Valentine, 1925-</field><field name="description">New Zealand is a land with a unique and very diversified flora which, along with the great range of habitats to be found throughout the country, has given rise to some remarkable plant communities.

Bowlby&#8217;s (1982) attachment theory implies that optimal outcomes are associated with an attachment relationship that is characterised by a confidence in the accessibility and responsiveness of the caregiver. Three studies were designed to explore changes in New Zealand adolescents&#8217; perceptions of their attachment to mothers, fathers, and friends, and the relative impact of these relationships on three measures of self esteem. Two dimensions of the attachment relationship were assessed, the utilisation of emotional support and proximity, and the quality of affect. Study 1 (n = 180) revealed that although adolescents utilised their mothers for support and proximity more than their fathers, and perceived their mothers as more responsive than fathers, they did not differ in their quality of affect towards their parents. Friends were utilised significantly more in support seeking situations than in proximity seeking situations. Study 2 (n = 493) revealed that male and female adolescents differed in their perceptions of their attachment to mothers in late adolescence. With increasing age, females reported that they would utilise maternal support and proximity more, whereas males reported utilising their mothers less in both types of situation. However, both male and female adolescents continued to report a high quality of affect towards their mothers throughout adolescence. No differences were found in male and female adolescents' perceptions of their attachment to fathers. With increasing age, males and females utilised paternal support and proximity less, and reported a lower quality of affect towards their fathers. Adolescents continued to utilise their friends highly for support throughout adolescence, and increased their utilisation of friends for proximity as they got older. Regardless of age, females reported a higher quality of affect towards their friends than males. These findings suggested that substantial changes take place in attachment relationships from early to late adolescence, and that these changes are affected by the sex of the adolescent and the sex of the parent. Further analyses revealed that Pacific Island adolescents utilised their mothers significantly less for support than European/Pakeha adolescents. Adolescents from one-parent families utilised their fathers significantly less for support and proximity, and had a lower quality of affect towards them than adolescents from two-parent families. The utilisation of support and proximity from mothers, fathers, and friends was minimally related to overall self esteem, coping abilities and social competence. The quality of affect towards mothers and fathers was significantly related to all three measures of self esteem, whereas the quality of affect towards friends was significantly related only to social competence. Adolescent attachment to parents appears to exert a relatively stronger effect on self esteem than adolescent attachment to friends, regardless of the sex or age of the adolescent. Study 3 (n = 80) examined the main reasons for utilising parents and friends for emotional support, and for feeling close to parents and friends. Content analysis revealed that the reasons did not differ according to the age or sex of the adolescent but varied according to the attachment figure. Overall, the three studies revealed that New Zealand adolescents&#8217; descriptions of their relationships with parents and friends differed at both the cognitive-affective and behavioural levels of attachment. The divergent patterns of support seeking and proximity seeking highlighted these differences, and clearly illustrated the need to distinguish these two aspects of the behavioural dimension of attachment in adolescence. The implications of the findings for adolescent attachment to parents and friends are considered, and future directions for research are discussed.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3317</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of the double torsion specimen to the study of fracture in fibre reinforced plastics</field><field name="creator">Brown, Niven Rhys</field><field name="description">The increasing use of fibre reinforced polymers in structural components often requires an accurate assessment of the strength of the component. The strength of composite materials is usually based on the strength of an individual lamina. This is then combined in a manner depending on the orientation of the plies within the laminate. The actual failure process is often ignored in this type of analysis. Composite failure is the result of damage accumulation from a number of failure modes, in particular, fibre failure, matrix failure and failure of the interface between the fibres and matrix. Measurement of the interfacial strength requires specialised testing techniques in order to obtain accurate characterization of the interfacial failure processes. This research uses a double torsion specimen reinforced with fibres in a number of configurations. The testing techniques developed allow the interaction of a matrix crack with fibres, resulting in the failure of the interface. Finite element analysis has been used to gain an insight into the deformation mechanisms. A compliance change analysis has been developed so that the load in the fibres can be calculated. Results from the finite element analysis confirm the analytical procedures and show that, for the fibre/resin combination tested, the interface has a lower fracture toughness than the matrix material. The interaction between the fibres and matrix shows that the mechanism of fibre bridging inhibits the propagation of matrix cracks. This produces an apparent increase in the toughness of the composite system. To confirm the failure processes occurring, the technique of acoustic emission has been used to monitor the development of the specimen failure. In line with other workers, it is shown that matrix failure produces low amplitude events and interfacial failure produces mid amplitude events. Fibre failure did not occur to any significant degree. This thesis shows how the contribution from the presence of an interface affects the fracture of composite materials and how, via the reinforced double torsion specimen, this contribution can be measured and interpreted.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3323</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of active filters: including design limitations imposed by operational amplifier characteristics</field><field name="creator">Kay, John Stephen</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is the development of an understanding of some of the Limitations involved in the design of active filters.

(Christopher Michael), 1974-ichael</field><field name="description">This thesis examined the relative importance of natural and human influences to the population and assemblage dynamics of reef fishes in northeastern New Zealand. In particular, how different reef fishes responded to the implementation of no-take and partial marine reserve protection, and physical factors responsible for spatial differences in fish abundance. Included were data from prior to the establishment of a no-take marine reserve, multiple fished reference locations, biannual sampling and the use of two independent methods to provide quantitative estimates of fish abundance and size. This combination of factors is rare in studies of marine reserves was an important strategy leading to an improved understanding of the mechanisms structuring fish communities. Responses of the reef fish assemblage to changes in fishing mortality were examined at the Poor Knights Islands Marine Reserve. Full no-take marine reserve protection was implemented on the 1st Oct 1998 but for the prior 17 years, the Poor Knights Reserve comprised only two small no-take zones and allowed recreational fishing in the rest of the reserve. Following implementation of no-take marine reserve status the reef fish community changed rapidly; there were no obvious changes at either reference location. Species targeted by fishers, such as Pagrus auratus (snapper) and Caprodon longimanus (pink maomao), responded most strongly to protection. An increase in the density of some non-targeted species can probably be attributed to climatic effects, rather than a reduction in fishing pressure. A decline in the abundance of several species at the Poor Knights may have been a result of natural mortality, or competitive or predatory interactions with snapper. Along with human influences (fishing), physical variables are important in determining the distribution and abundance of reef fish. Four locations (two mainland and two island) were surveyed in northeastern New Zealand to determine spatial patterns for seven labrid species, one of the most abundant and widespread taxa of reef fish in New Zealand. The underlying mechanisms were then explored through an examination of the relationship between swimming ability (as examined through pectoral fin morphology), exposure and depth. Each of the four locations consistently displayed distinct labrid assemblages, likely due to the influence of the East Auckland Current. Regardless of location, there was a consistent depthrelated trend for most labrids and a trend for some species to be associated with certain levels of wave exposure. By analogy with tropical labrid assemblages, it was expected that there would be a clear relationship between pectoral fin aspect ratio and depth and/or exposure. However, this relationship was not strongly evident suggesting that wave exposure may not be as important for labrids on northeastern New Zealand reefs as hypothesised for tropical coral reef systems. The response of snapper, an important recreational and commercial finfish, was investigated following the cessation of all fishing at the Poor Knights. The rate of response of snapper to protection was rapid, in areas that had previously been partially protected as well as in those that had been fully protected from fishing, with the overall density of legal sized fish increasing by 7.4 times over 4 years, likely a result of recolonisation rather than recruitment. The 818% increase in snapper biomass has the potential to enhance areas outside or within the reserve through the export of biomass (eggs and/or larvae and adults) - the daily batch fecundity was 11 to 18 times higher at the Poor Knights compared to the reference locations. The effects of partial protection on reef fish were further examined at the Mimiwhangata Marine Park, an area where recreational fishing is permitted but all commercial fishing has been prohibited for 18 years. Snapper showed no difference in abundance or size between the Mimiwhangata Marine Park and adjacent control areas, with the density of snapper most similar to fished reference locations. The lack of any recovery by snapper within the Marine Park, despite the exclusion of commercial fishers and restrictions on recreational fishing, and results from the Poor Knights, indicates that partial fishing regulations are ineffective as conservation tools for protecting targeted species or for fish communities in general (i.e. through reduction in by-catch). Results from this study provide evidence that recreational fishing has significant impacts on reef fishes.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">M&#257;ori parents at school: the role of the M&#257;ori parent community in the delivery of te reo M&#257;ori school curriculum</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Alexander George</field><field name="description">This thesis represents the results of a three-year intervention study of a group of M&#257;ori language teachers, their pupils and M&#257;ori parent communities in the Northland region of New Zealand. The study was motivated by the problem of continuing low academic achievement for M&#257;ori students in state mainstream schools. The assumption that existing teaching outputs of M&#257;ori language were quite strong and so could be used to model improvements for other school subjects and teachers to follow for M&#257;ori students was examined. In fact this was found to be a mistaken assumption as serious problems were located for the teaching of the M&#257;ori language. Two school policy areas were examined to locate possible solutions: Treaty of Waitangi policies in school charters and the operation of M&#257;ori Language Resourcing. It was found that the operation by school managements tended to exclude any active role for the M&#257;ori parent community. An action research model of intervention was designed and implemented to offer teachers in-service assistance in the provision of practice examinations to help better prepare students in their school certificate written examinations. Teachers were also encouraged to work directly with their M&#257;ori parent communities in order to improve teaching, student learning and outcomes. A case-study demonstrates that a dramatic rise in pupil performance occurred when parents worked along side the teacher in the classroom. The thesis argues that the nature of the Treaty of Waitangi provides a rationale for M&#257;ori parent participation, for direct involvement into school management (teaching issues) both for M&#257;ori students and the M&#257;ori language. It is concluded that a successful school for M&#257;ori students depends both the strength and shape of the tripartite relationship between the school, the home and the students.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3327</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptation of Cambodians in New Zealand: achievement, cultural identity and community development</field><field name="creator">Liev, Man Hau</field><field name="description">This thesis has two foci: how Cambodians with a refugee background manage their new life in Aotearoa/New Zealand, and how an identity as a Khmer Kiwi transnational community has developed. Analytic concepts&#8212; such as forced migration, cultural bereavement, adaptation, integration, diaspora, transnationalism, identification, and community of practice&#8212; are used to trace the trajectory of the contemporary way of life of Cambodians, their community development, and their cultural identity. The data gathered from mixedmethod research reveal the various opinions, strategies, coping mechanisms, and paths that Cambodian participants have adopted in order to adapt to life in New Zealand and still maintain their Khmer heritage. The majority of participants were proud of their personal achievements, and now have found normalcy in their new life. Individual struggles to engage and integrate with multicultural New Zealand society have required negotiation and protection of group interests, and inevitably some of these have resulted in conflicts and fragmentation within the Khmer community. Religious practice, organisation, and leadership became the main driving forces for asserting Khmer community identity. Collective memory was harnessed to deal with shared cultural bereavement, and the quest for belonging lent momentum to the community&#8217;s development and management of its identity. Khmer Theravada Buddhism has emerged as a means by which the majority of Cambodians can achieve their spiritual wellbeing, and has become a platform for various community identity developments within the New Zealand social and legal contexts. Gender roles and structures are a significant part of community development and of my analysis. This development of Khmer identity in New Zealand is a new strand of Khmer identity: Khmer heritage, transnational experience, and &#8216;Kiwi-ism&#8217;. Such transformation of identity reflects geo-political influences on integration in the form of belonging to and identifying with two or more groups. For example, the majority of participants proudly identified themselves as Khmer Kiwis. Their transnational lives have been enriched by their country of origin (Cambodia) and their country of residence (Aotearoa/New Zealand). Key words: Cambodian refugees, forced migration, adaptation, integration, transnationalism, Buddhism, Khmer identity, community development, and community of practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420305 New Zealand cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3362</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mesozoic geology of the Matawai district, Raukumara Peninsula</field><field name="creator">Isaac, Michael J.</field><field name="description">At Matawai, Raukumara Peninsula a high angle unconformity separates Cretaceous conglomerates, sandstones and siltstones from the underlying Urewera Greywacke, at least a part of which is upper Jurassic. This unconformity is believed to be of considerable significance. It represents a considerable time gap, a major deformation phase, and the initiation of a new regional sedimentation cycle. Mapping and sedimentological studies enable the recognition of two major lithostratigraphic units within Cretaceous strata at Matawai. The Aptian - Coniacian MATAWAI GROUP (new name) includes the Koranga, Te Wera and Karekare Formations. It is overlain unconformably by the Maastrichtian - ?Landenian WHAREKOPAE GROUP (new name), consisting of the Tahora (revived name) and Rakauroa Formations. The low angle unconformity between the Matawai and Wharekopae Groups is believed to represent only a minor phase of deformation and renewed marine transgression. It is local, not regional, and does not mark a significant time gap. A further unconformity separates Koranga Formation shallow marine coarse clastic sediments from texturally more mature sediments of the overlying Te Wera and Karekare Formations. It too is interpreted as being of only minor significance; it marks only a short period of non-deposition and not a major change in sedimentation pattern. Six biostratigraphic zones, all based on short-ranging species of either Inoceramus or Aucellina have been mapped in Matawai Group strata. Diverse shallow water faunas of the Koranga, Te Wera and lower Karekare Formations are succeeded by upper Karekare assemblages containing few fossils other than Inoceramus. Koranga Formation sandstones are texturally and compositionally immature. Like thick-bedded Urewera sandstones, they are of very mixed provenance, being derived from acid plutonic - high grade metamorphic, sedimentary and volcanic sources. Thus although the oldest Matawai Group strata are stratigraphically discrete from the Urewera Greywacke, they were derived largely from similar sources. Petrographic study of sandstones and X-ray study of siltstones suggest Karekare Formation sediments were derived largely from underlying Urewera and Matawai strata. Reworking of unlithified Matawai Group sediments provided much of the detritus for the glauconitic quartzose Tahora sandstone and the siliceous Rakauroa siltstones and shales. Distribution and composition of clays and feldspars in Matawai and Wharekopae rocks indicate a proportion of the sediment was derived from a granitic source to the south or southeast. Although zeolites and authigenic epidote are common in Urewera rocks at Matawai, extensive zeolitisation is virtually restricted to the sandstones and conglomerates overlying the Urewera Greywacke - Matawai Group unconformity. Development of zeolites is not, therefore, wholly a function of depth of burial. Volcanogenic Urewera and Koranga sandstones are both suitable hosts for zeolite formation, and restriction of extensive zeolitisation to the latter indicates the importance of permeability in controlling zeolite distribution. The relatively permeable Koranga Formation was a paleoaquifer because of its stratigraphic position between relatively impermeable Urewera and Karekare strata. From consideration of regional facies patterns, Wharekopae strata at Matawai and their coal measure and marginal marine equivalents in the South Island are believed to be the compositionally mature end products of a sedimentation cycle initiated in Aptian (Korangan) time. Matawai Group strata are considered to post-data the major deformation pulse known as the Rangitata Orogeny. Study of published and unpublished work on coeval rocks elsewhere in New Zealand suggest a fundamental and regional break between Aptian, Albian or even younger sediments, and older rocks. The Matawai Group and its coeval equivalents should, therefore, be included in the Kaikoura Sequence, and not, as has been proposed, in the underlying Rangitata Sequence.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3328</field></doc><doc><field name="title">GABAA receptors in the basal ganglia of the rat, baboon and the human brain</field><field name="creator">Waldvogel, Henry J.</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3329</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seismic analysis and design of post-tensioned concrete masonry walls</field><field name="creator">Laursen, Peter (Peter Thorup)</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the seismic analysis and design of post-tensioning concrete masonry (PCM) walls. Using unbonded post-tensioning, walls are vertically prestressed by means of strands or bars which are passed through vertical ducts inside the walls. As the walls are subjected to lateral displacements (in-plane loading), gaps form at the horizontal joints, reducing the system stiffness. As long as the prestressing strands are kept within the elastic limit, or at least maintain a considerable amount of the initial prestressing force, they can provide a restoring force, which will return the walls to their original alignment upon unloading. The key feature in this behaviour is attributable to the tendons being unbonded over the entire wall height, allowing for distribution of tendon strain over the entire length of the tendon. An extensive literature review found that post-tensioning of masonry has had limited application in seismic areas and that there currently are no specific code requirements for it&#8217;s use for ductile seismic design, largely as a consequence of little knowledge about the ductility capacity and energy dissipation characteristics. It was concluded that structural testing of PCM walls and concrete masonry creep and shrinkage testing were essential to advance the understanding of this construction type. Creep and shrinkage experiments confirmed that long term prestress losses are considerable in both grouted and ungrouted concrete masonry, and must be taken into account in design. It was concluded that it is essential to use high strength steel for prestressing of PCM in order to reduce long term losses. Structural testing confirmed that fully grouted unbonded post-tensioned concrete masonry is a competent material combination for ductile structural wall systems. In particular, PCM walls strengthened in the flexural compression zones with confining plates are expected to successfully withstand severe ground shaking from an earthquake. It was suggested that partially and ungrouted PCM walls may suitably be used in strength design (non-ductile). The proposed prediction method for wall in-plane behaviour was validated by experimental results. Good correlation between predictions and results was found. Displacement spectra were developed for ductile seismic design of PCM walls. These can be used to accurately estimate the displacement demand imposed on multi-storey PCM cantilever walls.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3330</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Network event detection with entropy measures</field><field name="creator">Eimann, Raimund E.

Network streams are an example for such discrete information sources. This thesis investigates the use of information measures for the detection of events in network streams. Starting with the fundamental entropy and complexity measures proposed by Shannon and Kolmogorov, it reviews a range of candidate information measures for network event detection, including algorithms from the Lempel-Ziv family and a relative newcomer, the T-entropy. Using network trace data from the University of Auckland, the thesis demonstrates experimentally that these measures are in principle suitable for the detection of a wide range of network events. Several key parameters influence the detectability of network events with information measures. These include the amount of data considered in each traffic sample and the choice of observables. Among others, a study of the entropy behaviour of individual observables in event and non-event scenarios investigates the optimisation of these parameters. The thesis also examines the impact of some of the detected events on different information measures. This motivates a discussion on the sensitivity of various measures. A set of experiments demonstrating multi-dimensional network event classification with multiple observables and multiple information measures concludes the thesis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information Theory</field><field name="subject">Entropy</field><field name="subject">Network Events</field><field name="subject">Anomaly Detection</field><field name="subject">Network Event Detection</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3427</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure, metamorphism and mineral deposits in the Diahot region, northern New Caledonia</field><field name="creator">Briggs, Roger M.</field><field name="description">The area studied, covers about 150 square kilometers in the northern end of New Caledonia in the lower parts of the Diahot River near Ou&#233;goa. The rocks consist dominantly of a metamorphosed Cretaceous sedimentary-igneous sequence of carbonaceous pelites with intercalated basaltic rocks and rhyolitic tuffs. The Cretaceous sequence is flanked to the southwest by Eocene rocks consisting mainly of siliceous argillites, phtanites (massive cherts) and limestones. High-pressure metamorphism, radiometrically dated at 38-21 m.y. (Oligocene-lowermost Miocene) by Coleman (1967), increases progressively in grade towards the northeast in a continuous sequence from lawsonite-albite facies through glaucophanitic greenschists to eclogitic glaucophanitic albite-epidote amphibolites. Lowest, grade rocks occur in the southwest near the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary and the highest grade rocks are exposed along the east coast and as tectonically-emplaced blocks in fault zones around Ou&#233;goa. Regional metamorphic assemblages are defined with respect, to four zones in pelitic parents which in order of increasing metamorphic grade are:- (1) lowest grade rocks, (2) lawsonite zone, (3) transitional zone, (4) epidote zone. Metamorphic isograds are mapped for paraschist lawsonite, Na-amphibole, garnet and epidote; and for pumpellyite, Na-amphibole, lawsonite and omphacite in metabasalts. In the Cretaceous rocks the regional strike of the foliation is northwest-southeast with dips to the southwest, although small-scale steeply-plunging folds are abundant. On a regional scale the major structure is an open to isoclinal, asymmetric, reclined fold with a sinistral vergence, trending southwest, and it plunges steeply down the dip of the regional foliation. This folding occurred largely synchronously with high-pressure metamorphism. During retrogressive metamorphism, large-scale trans-current sinistral faulting occurred, striking northwest-southeast and dipping southwest. In the region north and east of Ou&#233;goa these faults characteristically occur as zones up to 2 km wide occupied by high-grade ortho- and paragneisses (glaucophanites) and serpentinites, and form a complex anastomosing network. This faulting, accompanied by broad flexuring, has removed some parts of the metamorphic sequence resulting in constrictions and broad, flexuring of the isograd patterns in certain areas of the field. Small-scale kink and chevron folding has occurred late in the tectonic history and post-date both the steeply-plunging folds and the metamorphism. Stratiform Cu-Pb-Zn mineralization with minor amounts of Au and Ag occur at five relatively major sites (Pilou, M&#233;r&#233;trice, Fern-Hill, Balade and Murat mines) and at numerous smaller localities throughout the field. The mineralization is restricted to definite stratigraphic horizons in the Cretaceous sequence where black carbonaceous phyllites are associated and interbedded with rhyolitic metatuffs. The sulphide ores are well laminated, show relict sedimentary textures, and occur as layers and lenses which are conformable with the host rocks. The deposits are thought to be sedimentary-volcanic in origin and derived from acid volcanic metalliferous exhalations which have undergone chemical precipitation and sedimentation in localized, black shale, euxinic environments on the sea floor. All of the deposits have been subjected to and variously modified by the metamorphism.

Pyloric caeca cycles showed an approximate although slightly displaced inverse relationship to gonad cycles. Changes in the gonad shown by histological sections confirmed these cycles. In addition to sexual reproduction C. calamaria may reproduce asexually by autotomy. Frequency of asexual reproduction did not vary seasonally and may be related to physiological stress or mechanical damage. Oocytes of S. australis and C. calamaria were fertilized in the laboratory and the resulting larvae reared through to metamorphosed starfish. The methods used in larval culture and embryological and larval development are described. Larvae of S. australis and C. calamaria closely resemble the larvae of Asterias rubens, described by Gemmill (1914), and of other planktotrophic asteroid larvae. Abnormal larvae found in some cultures are thought to result from, unsuitable culture conditions. It was found that oocytes of both species could be cross fertilized with sperm of the other. The settling behaviour was described and substrate preferences of advanced brachiolaria larvae of S. australis and C. calamaria were determined with larvae reared in the laboratory. These results were correlated with field observations of habitat preferences of juvenile starfish. C. calamaria larvae settled on almost any hard substratum provided it was coated with a primary film. Recently metamorphosed C. calamaria could not be located at Maori Bay and it is inferred that there is low recruitment from the plankton to the Maori Bay population. S. australis larvae would only settle, metamorphose and feed on the encrusting coralline alga Mesophyllum insigne. Nursery areas of offshore boulders covered with this alga were located at Maori Bay and these were found to support populations of juvenile starfish. Mesophyllum insigne appears to provide a stable and abundant food source for juvenile S. australis. The structure of the brachiolar arms and adhesive disc of S. australis and C. calamaria was determined from light microscopy and from scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The structure of these organs was very similar in S. australis and C. calamaria. The brachiolar arms are comprised of a stem region terminating in a crown of adhesive papillae. Adhesive papillae are made up of a variety of secretory cell types. Principal among these are elongated cells producing very electron dense secretory particles. These are released at the free cell surface attached to cilia. secretory particles appear to be important in temporary attachment of the brachiolar arms to the substratum. Ciliary sense cells, possibly used in the recognition of specific substrates are located at the tip of adhesive papillae. The adhesive disc is comprised of large cells packed with secretory droplets and elongated intracellular fibres. In the attached adhesive disc secretory droplets have been lost, having formed the cement attaching the disc to the substratum. The intracellular fibres are the principal anchoring structures running from the disc surface microvilli (locked into the attachment cement) to the underlying connective tissue of the attachment stalk. S. australis juveniles reared in the laboratory were maintained on Mesophyllum insigne substrata and the growth rates and feeding behaviour of individual starfish was determined. Growth of yearly settlement cohorts on a nursery site on the shore used in conjunction with laboratory results gave a fairly clear picture of growth after settlement. Growth rates followed a typical logistic curve, growth being slow initially and becoming more rapid later. The numbers of juveniles recruited to nursery areas vary from year to year but mortality following settlement appears to be low. It was found that juvenile S. australis predate M. insigne exclusively until they reach approximately 0.8cm in diameter (7-8 months old) when they may occasionally predate juvenile perna canaliculus. The incidence of carnivorous feeding gradually increases until juveniles are approximately 2.0-2.5cm in diameter (15-18 months old) by which time they are exclusively carnivorous on small P. canaliculus. As growth continues juvenile starfish gradually migrate from nursery areas to adjacent reefs where dense beds of adult P. canaliculus occur. Starfish of this species become sexually mature when they reach approximately 8.0cm in diameter. Juvenile C. calamaria reared in the laboratory feed on the primary film coating the substratum. Field observations at Leigh showed juveniles of 0.8-0.9cm diameter to be feeding on small barnacles on the undersides of boulders. Juveniles could not be reared to this size in the laboratory and the point at which juveniles change from a herbivorous or microphagous to a carnivorous diet is still unknown. Because of frequent autotomy it was not possible to determine growth rates of C. calamaria in the laboratory. Starfish of this species become sexually mature they reach 5.0-10.0cm in diameter.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3332</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The structure and stereochemistry of the diterpenes and the glycoalkaloid from solanum nigrum</field><field name="creator">Davis, Brian Reeve</field><field name="description">The diterpenoids are fairly widely distributed in nature.

Both main and changeover key performances were examined as a function of the relative reinforcement rates and of the changeover schedule duration. Main key performances changed quantitatively, but not qualitatively, as the temporal separation of components increased, with performance becoming less sensitive to relative reinforcement rates with increasing temporal separation. In general, absolute response rates were adequately predicated by the relative reinforcement rates, but in some conditions the absolute response rate was also affected by the availability of the responses. The rates of responding to change between components were controlled by the reinforcement rates in the both of the concurrent schedule components, and, in some conditions, varied independently of main key response rates. The rates of responding to alternate between components were a direct function of the reinforcement rate in the absent component, and were an inverse function of the reinforcement rate for main key responding in the same component. Animals alternated between the concurrent schedule components even when alternation reduced the overall rate of obtained reinforcement.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3336</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Daz sint noch ungelogeniu wort: a literary and linguistic commentary on the Gurnemanz episode in Book iii of Wolfram&#8217;s Parzival (161,9-179,12)</field><field name="creator">Gilmour, Simon Julian</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420109 German</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3335</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Patterns of stability and change orientations in organisational culture: a case study</field><field name="creator">Burchell, Richard Noel</field><field name="description">There is a fundamental need of all organisations to exhibit both stability and change behaviours in order to survive in the long term, particularly when operating in competitive environments. This duality may seem paradoxical and contradictory, but these interactions are necessary for sustainable organisational continuity. Stability and change should be considered in concert rather than focussing on change at the expense of stability. It is proposed that cultural manifestations can develop over time that directly or indirectly reflect organisational concerns with stability and change, and can be investigated as two key cultural dimensions. The aim of this study was to discover how and why organisational members associated their culture with the dimensions of stability and change. Interpretations of these associations provide support for the two dimensions being viewed as separate, but also being complementary and interdependent in nature. This differs from previous perspectives in the literature that portray the dimensions as being on a single dimension. This in-depth study was conducted in a single New Zealand business organisation. It shows how cultural orientations towards stability and change can be discerned as patterns. Associations by organisational members of cultural manifestations with the dimensions of stability and change was explored utilising a triangulation research design incorporating Concept Mapping and Pattern Matching, semi-structured interviews and observations as research methods. Pattern Matching is a technique that has not been previously employed in cultural research and the findings suggest the technique can be a useful tool in cultural analysis. The study showed that members found culture, and in particular its associations with stability and change, a somewhat challenging concept to articulate. This study also supports the need for the dimensions of stability and change to be viewed as being dynamic and interconnected. Nonetheless, a proposed typology was developed based on the premise that these dimensions are conceptually separate. It shows promise for better understanding the influence of culture on patterns of stability and change within organisations.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3347</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rhythms, feeding and respiration of the oyster Crassostrea gigas</field><field name="creator">Goodwin, Elizabeth Elsa</field><field name="description">Endogeneity of valve movement rhythms was demonstrated for the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas under constant conditions of temperature, light, salinity, water level and food availability. Rhythms continued for up to 6 weeks until the experiments were terminated. The rhythms showed a high degree of temperature compensation between 13 - 24&#730;C, but at 4&#730;C the free-running period was abnormally long. The length of the &#8220;open", or active phase decreased with temperature. Oysters collected from subtidal sites, as opposed to intertidal sites, also exhibited endogenous rhythms when held under constant condition. Oysters that received no food during a starvation trial were also rhythmic. Oysters subjected to artificial tidal cycles (HL 6:6h), show very precise synchronization of valve opening and closing to the cycles. Oysters were also be entrained to water disturbance cycles (6:6h) and light cycles (LD 12:12h), but the synchronization was not as precise. Rhythms were characterized by (1) split rhythms (2) spontaneous changes in the free-running period (3) spontaneous changes in rhythm clarity (4) spontaneous phase changes (5) and a Lot of "noise". These characteristics suggest that the underlying pacemaker controlling the rhythm may consist of more than one oscillator or more than one group of oscillators. No conclusive evidence could be found for semilunar or lunar rhythmicity. Cycles in the rate of algal cell clearance over a 24h period were shown by individual oysters. As a consequence of the variability between individuals combining the data tended to hide the existence of the rhythms. No evidence for rhythms in assimilation efficiency was found. Cell clearance rates were also affected by rising temperature over the range 4 - 25&#730;C, reaching a peak value at 17&#730;C. The rate of cell clearance fell sharply after 60 - 90min of feeding in a closed system, indicating that the rate was significantly affected by the decline in food availability. The time taken to open the valves and to start faeces production fell with increasing temperature. The amount of faeces production followed a similar trend. Assimilation efficiency fell with increasing temperature and many negative values were evident, suggesting contamination. However the total weight of faeces produced was less than that of food available implying that the oysters were assimilating inorganic material. The time taken to open the valves and the % oysters that opened their valves was adversely affected by declining salinity over the range 8.5 - 34&#8240;. The time taken to start faeces production and. the % of oysters that produced faeces followed a similar trend. Assimilation efficiency was not significantly different at 25.5 and 34&#8240;. AE% could not be measured at 8.5 and 17&#8240; due to a lack of normal faeces. Individual oysters showed cycles in the rate of oxygen uptake, but these were not synchronized to the tides or to each other. Pooling the data to calculate means cancelled out the individual rhythmicities. The presence or absence of food did not affect the expression of the cycle. The rate of oxygen uptake was positively correlated to oyster dry weight, temperature and salinity. Though for salinity the rate of oxygen uptake fell sharply below a critical salinity occurring between 10 - 13&#8240;. Oysters held in sealed respirometers maintained a constant rate of oxygen uptake until a critical level of oxygen availability was reached, the rate of oxygen uptake dropped .significantly below this level. The slope of the regression lines (&#730;b&#730;), prior to reaching the critical oxygen level, increased with temperature, salinity and food concentration. But the time taken to reach the critical oxygen level, and the level of oxygen availability at which this occurred, was not significantly correlated with temperature, salinity or food concentration. The pattern of valve movement corresponded to the level of oxygen available. Valve movements became very frequent as the critical oxygen level was approached. Activity was reduced to occasional periods of valve movement after it was reached. The level of activity was adversely affected by declining salinity, but was not affected by the level of food availability.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rarotongan society: the creation of tradition</field><field name="creator">Baddeley, Josephine Gail</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3339</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The crystal structure of acetamidoxime</field><field name="creator">Claridge, G.

The sequence consists of an airfall deposit overlain in places by up to four ignimbrites erupted from the Okataina Volcanic Centre. The airfall consists, at its base, of crystal poor (&lt; 7%) pumice with a phenocryst assemblage of plagioclase, quartz, hypersthene, magnetite and ilmenite with rare zircon and apatite. Towards the top of the airfall unit crystal rich (&gt; 7%) pumice is present along with crystal poor pumice and thus forms a bimodal population. The crystal rich pumice has the same mineralogy as the crystal poor pumice plus hornblende. The pumice ranges from rhyolite to high-silica rhyolite with the rhyolite containing high TiO2, MgO, CaO, Zr and Sr and low K2O, Ba and Rb in comparison to the high silica rhyolite. The mixture of high silica rhyolite and rhyolite pumice is present throughout the remainder of the eruption with more high silica rhyolite than rhyolite erupted and with no significant change in proportions. The variation in chemistry and mineralogy indicates that the magma was compositionally zoned. Random and oscillatory zoning with evidence of resorption episodes in plagioclase and hypersthene suggest that the magma was turbulently convecting. Zoning in the magma was therefore probably characterised by fluid interfaces between fluid dynamically distinct layers. Stability relations of hornblende and pressure estimates suggest that the hornblende containing rhyolite lay above the high silica rhyolite. The variation is interpreted as having formed by rapid crystallisation and absorption of water on the margins of the intrusion. Least square calculations indicate that fractional crystallisation is a viable mechanism although diffusion through the fluid interface(s) must have occurred with redistribution of components by convection in each layer. The vent of the Matahina eruption tapped the side of the magma chamber close to the interface between the rhyolite and high silica rhyolite. Turbulence during the eruption lead to limited mixing of the zoned magma with the formation of pumice with overlapping mineral composition ranges and rare banded pumice. Indicators such as a lack of an associated veneer deposit, the multi-flow nature of the eruption sequence and strong welding suggest that the eruption was of moderate violence (for its type). Modelling of welding suggests depositional temperatures of between 650 and 700&#176;C in the Rangitaiki Valley. The presence of unexsolved titanomagnetites and osumilite support such high depositional temperatures. Almandine garnet of vapour phase origin indicates that little air was incorporated into the eruption column. Devitrification was characterised by the formation of axiolitic and spherulitic intergrowths of cristobalite and alkali feldspar. SEM observations suggest that the density of nucleating points determines the textures in the devitrifying ignimbrite. Degassing of the ignimbrite was characterised by corrosion of glass and subsequent deposition of minerals such as tridymite and alkali feldspar. Si and Zr were the least mobile elements. The Matahina eruption sequence is an example of a zoned pluton erupted early in its evolution.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3345</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of urban form: a descriptive technique and investigation of the form of a New Zealand urban environment</field><field name="creator">Civil, Denise</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates factors which influence the physical form of the urban environment at the micro-scale. Three aspects of form are considered. These are configuration, separation, and consistency. A method of assessing the form of a property from a public place with respect to these aspects is outlined. The technique breaks each aspect into a scale of form types as a tool for measuring the formal characteristics of the environment. These form types are used to describe an urban environment. A comparison of this description with the physical attributes of the area identifies four factors which may have affected the patterns and distributions of the forms observed in the description. These are land use, land ownership patterns, time, and regulatory controls. Detailed studies of these factors in five particular areas reveals that relationships between each of the factors and the incidence of the various form types exist. Correspondences which suggest that the factor probably has an influence on the forms identified are evident in varying degrees depending on the factor considered.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building::310100 Architecture and Urban Environment::310103 Urban and regional planning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3346</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The sin-complex: a critical study of English versions of the Grimms&#8217; Kinder- und Hausm&#228;rchen in the nineteenth century in comparison with the German originals</field><field name="creator">Sutton, Martin James</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the English versions of the Grimms&#8217; Kinder- und Hausm&#228;rchen (= KHM) published between the years 1823 and 1884, i.e. from the first translation by Edgar Taylor and David Jardine, German Popular Stories (1823 and 1826), to the first complete edition of the Grimms&#8217; collection of stories and notes by Margaret Hunt, Grimm&#8217;s Household Tales (1884). Each of the first eleven chapters deals with a specific English edition and gives an analysis of one or more stories from that edition together with the texts of the German original. The two versions, German and English, are placed alongside each other in parallel columns to facilitate comparison. The twelfth chapter takes the final paragraph of one story, &#8216;Sneewittchen&#8217; (KHM 53), and examines the seven different English versions of it in the editions discussed in the previous chapters. The final chapter compares the quality of English translations of the KHM in the nineteenth century with that of the Grimms&#8217; sole venture in translating tales in the English language into German, viz. Wilhelm Grimm&#8217;s Irische Elfenm&#228;rchen (1826). Included as an appendix is a tabulated concordance of the contents of the twelve major editions discussed in this thesis. The investigation shows that the areas deemed to be sensitive ones by English translators were those which had to do with what Darton (Children&#8217;s Books in England, 1982, p.99) has singled out as &#8216;a deep-rooted sin-complex&#8217; in England. Any story that touched on the issues of religious belief and superstition, the human body and its physical nature, violence and evil, and the intense emotions felt by human beings which prompt them to commit violent and destructive acts, was inevitably viewed with concern and mistrust, especially by purveyors of children&#8217;s literature in the nineteenth century. All these issues, as well as the element of fantasy which so readily admits and entertains them, were prone to considerable revision by successive translators of the KHM.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420109 German</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3348</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of beta-adrenergic antagonists in patients with heart failure</field><field name="creator">Doughty, Robert N.</field><field name="description">Background Congestive heart failure is a common clinical syndrome, the incidence and prevalence of which appear to be increasing. Mortality and morbidity remain high despite major advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology and management of heart failure over recent years. Consequently there is a need for further therapies which can improve the outlook for patients with heart failure. The beta-blockers have traditionally been contraindicated in patients with heart failure. However, there is a strong rationale for using these agents in addition to the ACE inhibitors. The aims of this thesis were several fold. Firstly, to determine the magnitude of the problem which heart failure represents in New Zealand. Secondly, to determine the effects of beta-blockers, on LV size and function, symptoms, and exercise tolerance in patients with heart failure due to ischaemic heart disease. Finally, to conduct a systematic overview to determine the effects of beta-blockers on total mortality in patients with heart failure. Methods Data were obtained from the New Zealand Health Information Service regarding hospitalisations and deaths due to heart failure in New Zealand. A randomised, placebo-controlled trial of the effects of carvedilol, a vasodilator beta-blocker, was carried out in 20 hospitals in Australia and New Zealand. In this study patients with heart failure due to ischaemic heart disease were randomised to either carvedilol or placebo in addition to their usual treatment. An echocardiographic substudy was carried out in 10 of the 20 centres. The aims of this substudy were to determine the effects of carvedilol on left ventricular size and function, using quantitative 2D-echocardiography. Finally, the effects of beta-blockers on total mortality was examined in a systematic overview. Results The data regarding heart failure in New Zealand showed that each year there were an average of 8000 hospital admissions each year of 5000 patients with heart failure. In addition, there were at least 850 deaths each year directly related to heart failure. The cost associated with the hospital admissions was estimated at NZ$50 million per year, or 1% of the total health budget in New Zealand. The ANZ carvedilol study demonstrated firstly, that carvedilol is well tolerated in patients with heart failure due to ischaemic heart disease. Left ventricular ejection fraction improved compared with placebo treated patients and left ventricular size was reduced when assessed by M-mode echocardiography. Despite these improvements in left ventricular function, symptoms and exercise tolerance were unchanged. However, there was a reduction in a combined end-point of death or hospital readmission in the carvedilol group compared with placebo. The 2D-echocardigraphy substudy demonstrated that carvedilol reduced both end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes and prevented the progressive LV dilatation which occurred in the placebo group. These changes occurred with the improvement in LV ejection fraction which had previously been reported. In addition to these favourable effects on LV size and function, left ventricular regional wall motion was improved. The overview of 24 randomised trials involving 3141 patients showed that beta-blocker therapy reduced total mortality by 31% compared with control. Conclusions Firstly, the NZ data has confirmed that heart failure remains a major public health problem in New Zealand. The ANZ Carvedilol Trial has shown the carvedilol is safe and well tolerated in patients with heart failure due to ischaemic heart disease. Carvedilol improved left ventricular ejection fraction, reduced left ventricular volumes and improved left ventricular regional wall motion. In addition, carvedilol reduced death or hospital readmission but had little effect on symptoms or exercise tolerance. The results from the meta-analysis have shown that beta-blocker therapy reduced total mortality by approximately one-third. Such data support the use of beta-blockers in addition to ACE inhibitors in the treatment of patients with heart failure. However, further randomised, controlled trials are required to reliably determine the effects of beta-blockers in different patient subgroups, such as the elderly and those with more severe heart failure, as well as the effects on total mortality before such therapy can be recommended for widespread use in all patients with heart failure.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3349</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epidemiological studies of leg ulcers in Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Walker, Natalie K.</field><field name="description">A leg ulcer is generally considered to be any break in the skin on the lower leg (below the knee) or on the foot, which has been present for more than six weeks. Typically the condition is a consequence of disease of the circulatory system, and can cause considerable disability. The Auckland leg ulcer study is a community-based study of leg ulceration conducted in the North Auckland and Central Auckland health districts of New Zealand. The study aimed to determine the prevalence and incidence of leg ulcers in the community and investigate several possible risk factors for the condition. Cases were identified through notifications from health professionals and by self-notification. Cases aged between 40 and 99 years and on the electoral roll for the study region were invited to participate in a case-control study. Controls were individuals without leg ulcers and were selected from the electoral roll using a stratified random sampling process. Controls were also aged between 40 and 99 years and had to be resident within the study region to be eligible. Four hundred and twenty-six cases with current leg ulcers were identified during the 12-month study period, with 241 cases and 224 controls interviewed for the case-control study. Overall, the occurrence of leg ulcers in the general population was low, however, the prevalence and cumulative incidence increased dramatically with age, and changed according to gender and region. The average age at ulcer onset in interviewed cases was 65 years. Leg ulcers took approximately 12 months on average to heal, and recurrence occurred in 59% of cases. Treatment strategies were variable, and almost a quarter of all cases had been admitted to hospital within the last five years because of their ulcers. The average length of hospital stay was 34 days. Results from the case-control study indicated that deep vein thrombosis, lower limb surgery, leg fracture, and varicose veins were strong risk factors for the development of leg ulcers, Furthermore, nulligravida increased the risk of ulcer development while prolonged breast-feeding decreased risk, suggesting a hormonal component to the development of leg ulcers in women. These data have important implications for the prevention of this chronic condition.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3351</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Mechanism of the anti-tumour action of flavone acetic acid and its xanthenone acetic acid analogues</field><field name="creator">Zwi, Leon Jonathan</field><field name="description">The search for new compounds with anti-tumour activity is driven by the high mortality from disseminated visceral carcinomas for which few effective treatments exist. The experimental agent flavone acetic acid (FAA) has stimulated interest because of its broad spectrum of activity against solid tumours in mice. This remarkable activity spectrum suggested an unusual mechanism of action. The aim of the thesis was to elucidate the mechanism of action of FAA and its analogues in mouse tumours, particularly the rapid induction of haemorrhagic necrosis Light and electron microscopic studies of Colon 38 tumours treated with 1.2 mmo1/kg FAA revealed a sequence of tumour cell separation and rounding focal apoptosis and finally confluent necrosis with blood vessel engorgement and rupture within 4 - 8 h. This was accompanied by a loss of energy metabolites. The combination of apoptotic and necrotic modes of cell death suggested that both ischaemic and non-ischaemic mechanisms were involved. The role of blood flow failure was further investigated in Colon 38 and EMT6 tumours using a double label fluorescent vessel-labelling technique, which demonstrated a progressive and sustained fall in blood flow, beginning within 15 min of treatment. A mathematical model of ischaemic tumour cell killing using data from measurements of tumour perfusion, the rate of FAA-induced cell killing and the rate of cell death following global ischaemia indicated that mechanisms in addition ischaemia were involved. However, comparison of the resistance to FAA of avascular intraperitoneal tumour multicellular spheroids and vascularised tumours suggested that the major component of the anti-tumour effect was indeed blood vessel-dependent. The vessel-independent effects of FAA were then studied in vitro, using EMT6 tumour multicellular spheroids which had been placed for six days in the peritoneal cavities of mice to become infiltrated by macrophages and lymphocytes. These ex vivo spheroids were more that twice as sensitive as spheroids grown entirely in vitro, when exposed to 2.5 mM FAA for 24 h. This provides evidence for immune cell mediation of the FAA anti-tumour effect. To determine the relative importance of the vessel dependent and the immune mediated effects of FAA, a novel vascularised spheroid tumour system, which contained both avascular and vascular component was developed and studied. FAA treatment caused necrosis only in the vascularised component preceded by a loss in perfusion. The avascular tumour tissue also showed evidence of some cell loss by apoptosis. Thus, in tumour tissue not relying directly on blood vessels for metabolite exchange only limited cell killing occurs suggesting that treatment with FAA-like agents alone would have limited ability to cure. The anti-tumour activities of a series of xanthenone acetic acid (XAA) analogues of FAA, were then compared with FAA by examination and measurement of morphological changes in subcutaneous tumours and spheroids, and by measurement of blood perfusion In tumours. Those XAA analogues which were active in inducing haemorrhagic necrosis also caused FAA-like morphological changes in tumours and spheroids and inhibited blood flow, indicating a similar mode of action to FAA. The parent XAA and FAA were approximately equipotent, and 5-methyl XAA and 5,6-dimethyl XAA were about ten times as potent as FAA. 3-O-methyl XAA, 8-methyl XAA and xanthenone-4,5-diacetic acid showed no FAA-like activities. Examination of non-tumour tissues after therapeutic doses of FAA and 5,6-dimethyl XAA showed cytolytic lesions Including necrosis In the peripheral lymphoid tissues, the thymus and the uterus. Thus, although these agents lack the myelosuppressive effects of conventional chemotherapeutic agents cell killing is not entirely specific for tumours. The sensitive tissues, including tumours, have in common a high content of macrophages or neutrophils, and regions of low vascular density. The thesis studies have shown that FAA and its analogues differ from conventional cytotoxic (anti-proliferative) agents in their mechanism of action. Direct toxicity against tumour cells is of minor importance compared to macrophage mediated cytotoxicity and perfusion failure. If biological activity can be demonstrated in humans FAA-like agents may show clinical utility in combination with radiotherapy, conventional or hypoxia selective cytotoxic agents.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3356</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Status epilepticus: mechanisms of generation and associated neuropathology</field><field name="creator">Young, Deborah</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3354</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The chronotope as a model for hypermedia in architectural education</field><field name="creator">Soutar, Anna L., 1942-</field><field name="description">The thesis is a retrospective reporting and a critical examination of HyperSteel.

"The thesis", part 1 of the thesis, is a theoretical statement comprising, in Chapter I, an explicit statement of the theoretical framework in the form of five premises derived from philosophy and theories of psychology, art and architecture, and sociology. And, in Chapter II, a statement of the two hypotheses (that dwelling environments are perceived as "meaning" the people who live in them and that people choose dwelling environments, other things being equal, according to their concept of the kind of people they are) and the assumptions necessary to test them. In Part 2: "The Research Method" Chapter III covers the development of the measure of closure in dwelling environments. Closure was chosen in Chapter II as the environmental variable to be used for the purposes of this study. The final measure comprises five sets of four bird&#8217;s eye view perspective line drawings depicting five situations in a typical house in which closure is varied in four steps from very open to very closed. Chapter IV describes the development of the measure of household identity. The measure of household identity was developed especially to be of relevance to the choice of degrees of closure in dwelling environments. The measure is derived from actual verbal responses of the respondents to open ended questions asked in pilot studies. In Chapter V, the last chapter in Part 2, the research design of the survey study is described: the research model used, the design of the questionnaire, and the sampling method. The first chapter of Part 3: "The Results and Discussion of the Results", Chapter VI, presents the sample size (610) and shows that the sample is representative of the population of the Auckland greater urban area. In Chapter VII, the results relating to hypothesis I are presented and discussed. The results weakly support the hypothesis but the correlations are not of sufficient strength to be used predictively. In Chapter VIII the results of hypothesis 2 are presented and discussed. These results also support the hypothesis but even less strongly so than for hypothesis 1. Chapter VIII also covers sub-hypothesis 1, that people choose dwelling environments according to their "objective&#8221; household identity, In Chapter IX the results of the hypotheses are compared and summarized. And in Chapter X the implications of the results are outlined: an attempt is made to relative the results to the theoretical framework and from this implications for a possible theory of aesthetics are drawn. The implications of the results for the theory and practice of architecture are delineated and finally suggestions for future research are outlined.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3358</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The complaints and disciplinary process in New Zealand and the effect of complaints on doctors</field><field name="creator">Cunningham, Wayne Kenneth</field><field name="description">New Zealand society assumes that the medical complaints process enhances the delivery of medical care, although the literature suggests that complaints may impact negatively on doctors, and their ability to practice. This thesis examines the impact of the complaints process on doctors in New Zealand. It considers the practice of medicine from the viewpoints of the epistemology of medicine; the doctor-patient relationship; and the notion of professionalism. It presents the results of research methods investigating New Zealand doctors using focus groups; a cross sectional questionnaire based survey; and in-depth semi-structured interviews. Findings include: One in three doctors has received a complaint. The annual rate of complaint is 5.70%, 15% of complaints are upheld. Complaints impact negatively on the person of the doctor, the doctor-patient relationship, and doctors&#8217; ability to practice. The purposes of a complaints system include: the maintenance of trust and professional standards; being a voice for patients; and learning from mistakes and errors. Doctors&#8217; attitudes are consistent with notions of professionalism. Defensive medicine is an adverse outcome of the complaints process. Doctors suggest a Complaints Tribunal as a single point of entry into the complaints process. The current complaints process is not improving the delivery of medical care to New Zealand society. New Zealand doctors are aware of both the biomedical and bio-psychosocial paradigms underlying modern medicine, and the results confirm the importance of the self of the doctor and the doctor-patient relationship in medical practice. The emergence of defensive medicine indicates that doctors may respond to complaints by practicing in a way that is not in their patients&#8217; best interests, but which serves to protect doctors themselves. Defensive medicine risks being unrecognised and becoming normalised into mainstream medical practice. The negative impact of complaints on doctors&#8217; values and beliefs indicate an erosion of values based professionalism. This thesis suggests that an appropriate model for considering medical professionalism is as a state of relationship between doctors and society. Appropriate change to the complaints process may enhance the doctor-society relationship and ultimately enhance the delivery of medical care in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3357</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The morality of planning: an exploration</field><field name="creator">Ferguson, Gael, 1959-</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the contention that planning is a moral activity concerned with the way in which people live in relation to nature or the environment. It suggests that planning is the moral framework by which communities and individuals confront their relationship with nature or the environment. It argues that certain disciplines such as town planning, resource management, environmental ethics, aspects of theology and of art are but isolated and narrowed aspects of a wider activity of planning. The rationale for embarking on such a discussion of planning relies in part on the observation that when modern planners take a more contemplative approach to their craft, they have often been perplexed about their frequent failure to deliver the good they assumed that planning set out to achieve. It is suggested that this intent to achieve good is inherent to planning and that it is a moral concern. Planning, under this analysis, is part of the wider realm of moral philosophy and decision-making - that is undertaken by all people. Planning extends beyond mere moral discourse to encompass a number of mechanisms that bind individuals and communities to the moral norms they have adopted. These mechanisms, one of which is the key institution of property rights, are also affected by ideas that change over time; they exist in a dynamic interrelationship with both planning discourse (debates about moral structures and norms) and planning codes (norms adopted by individuals and communities as standards for action). This thesis takes this broad interpretation of planning and considers it in relation to four periods in planning history. In doing so, a number of themes are identified in relation to the role of planners, the decision-making structures of planning and the nature of planning discourse. These themes are considered in relation to the way Maori planning systems have developed in New Zealand since European settlement. They are also considered in terms of whether it is possible to identify certain universal moral rules within planning and whether there are certain tasks that all planners must address.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3359</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermal evolution and fluid-rock interactions in the Orakeikorako- Te Kopia geothermal system, Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Bignall, Gregory, 1963-</field><field name="description">The active Orakeikorako-Te Kopia geothermal system was drilled in the mid-1960&#8217;s, down to 1405m, as part of a programme to investigate its electrical generation capability. Four wells were completed at Orakeikorako (23km NNE of Taupo) and two at Te Kopia, 9.5km further northeast. The exploration drilling provided information on the present day hydrological and thermal regime which is as hot as 265&#176;C (1137m drilled depth (-801m RL) in OK-2). Major flows into the wells occurred at depths down to 850m, although poor permeability and decline in mass output discouraged development. The waters discharged were of near neutral pH and had low salinities (highest Cl content from OK-2 &#8776;546mg/kg), low discharge enthalpies and indicated water temperatures (TSiO2 and TNaKCa) of 2l0&#176;C to 240&#176;C. A hydrologic model proposed here envisages a hot water reservoir in the OK-2 area (northeastern part of the Orakeikorako thermal area) with a lateral flow supplying water to the Red Hill (OK-4 area) in the southern part of the system and a concealed northeast flow which reaches the surface at Te Kopia. The Orakeikorako thermal area occupies a surface area of about 1.8km2, mainly on the east bank of the Waikato River, where dilute chloride-bicarbonate water discharges along faults and fractures in association with an extensive silica sinter sheet, boiling springs and geysers. The occurrence of a mordenite-smectite assemblage at shallow depths, plus the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition of surface discharge waters, indicate that the ascending chloride fluids are diluted by near surface (heated?) groundwaters. The &#948;D shift from local groundwater composition may be evidence for a magmatic component to the convecting hydrothermal system. Incursion of fluids from the relatively cool (&lt;l20&#176;C) steam-heated carapace into deep levels of the system and its mixing with the alkali-chloride fluids, produces argillic alteration, sealing and will eventually result in the demise of the system. Old silica sinter on the west bank, at the foot of the Tutukau Rhyolite Dome, is covered by Oruanui Ash (22,700 years B.P.) and demonstrates that the hydrologic character of this part of the system has changed due to a combination of fault movement, changes in the height of the watertable and sealing. The Te Kopia thermal area is located along 2.5km of the Paeroa Fault scarp, a major structural feature inferred to be controlling migration of deep hydrothermal fluids in the Orakeikorako-Te Kopia area. Surface activity at Te Kopia is characterised by acid alteration (including fumaroles, warm acid pools and steaming ground), although neutral pH alkali-chloride fluids discharged here within the last 3000 years and deposited silica sinter (C14 age on wood enveloped by sinter is 3026 +/- 43years B.P.). New thermal areas in the past --year have begun to develop in the northwestern part of Te Kopia, whilst cold hydrothermally altered ground (hosting a mordenite + clay assemblage) records a decline in activity in the southern part of the Te Kopia thermal area. The system is hosted by a generally SE dipping sequence of Pliocene to Quaternary ignimbrite, tuff and rhyolite lavas of the Taupo Volcanic Zone. Point counting, electron microprobe analyses of surviving primary phases (Fe, Mg, Al and Ti contents of hornblende and biotite), together with X-ray fluorescence and neutron activation analysis were used to distinguish three extensive ignimbrites encountered in the Orakeikorako-Te Kopia drillholes: (0.33Ma, sanidine-bearing) Paeroa, (0.35Ma) Te Kopia and (undated) Akatarewa Ignimbrites, despite their having been hydrothermally altered. Ignimbrite recognition is made on the basis of a combination of immobile trace and rare earth element abundances and ratios: Ta and Yb (ppm), P2O5(%) and the ratios Zr/Yb, Zr/Y, Yb/Hf, La/Lu, Nb/Hf, Zr/Nb, Zr/Lu, Yb/Ta, Ta/Lu, La/Tb and Nb/Ta. The Paeroa Ignimbrite is distinguished by is Eu anomaly ((Eu/Eu*)cn is 0.48 to 0.54), whereas the Te Kopia and Akatarewa Ignimbrites are characterised by their flatter REE Spidergrams ((Eu/Eu*)cn is ~1.0 and ~0.8 respectively). The correlation of the extensive ignimbrites was satisfactorily effected by a combination of their characteristic bulk rock and pumice chemistry, plus primary mineralogy, to enable the subsurface stratigraphy and structure of the Orakeikorako-Te Kopia geothermal system to be defined. The alteration assemblage below 500m consists of quartz, albite+adularia, with variable abundence and distribution of chlorite, pyrite, calcite, wairakite, epidote, pyrrhotite, titanite, leucoxene, siderite and clinozoisite; illite is a late overprint. Rare almandine occurs in rhyolite in OK-1: 1312.5m; this is the first known occurrence of garnet in an active geothermal system of the TVZ. The surficial alteration assemblage of kaolin, cristobalite, alunite, hematite and jarosite reflects alteration by acid sulphate-steam heated waters. The occurrence and textual relations exhibited by the hydrothermal mineral assemblage define the geochemical structure and thermal evolution of the Orakeikorako-Te Kopia system The activities of components of minerals, determined from electron microprobe analyses and composition-activity relationships (OK-2 discharge: log&#945;K+/&#945;H+=3.6, log&#945;Na+/&#945;H+=4.8) support the petrologic observation that illite is now the stable potassium phase (overprinting adularia), although a state of equilibrium between the sheet silicate and the fluids is clearly not fully reached. The Na/K ratio of the altering fluid is controlled by the albite-adularia reaction (dissolution of albite and replacement by adularia, after andesine), whilst the H2/H2S ratio is buffered by the virtually complete replacement of pyrrhotite by pyrite. The fluids are now slightly undersaturated with respect to calcite, this is shown by etched surfaces on some calcite grains. In the past the deep fluid boiled adiabatically from &gt;300&#176;C to ~250&#176;C as it ascended, resulting in the deposition of adularia, quartz and bladed calcite. The system has cooled, resulting in lower subsurface temperatures (as recorded by fluid inclusion geothermometry) suppressing boiling, and migrated northwards as a consequence of self sealing. The thermal decline and retention of CO2 in the deep alkali-chloride fluid shifted the alteration assemblage from one of albite-adularia stability to illite stability. The homogenisation (Th) temperatures of primary and secondary liquid-rich inclusions in 27 cores from different depths mostly match measured temperature profiles (e.g. OK-1 (shallow levels) and OK-2). Never-the-less, fluid inclusion data support mineral-inferred stability temperatures which indicate that parts of the Orakeikorako-Te Kopia system have cooled appreciably (e.g. OK-1, deep levels) and OK-4 (maximum Tbore=238&#176;C, maximum Th=312&#176;C; epidote abundant). In contrast, the northwestern margin (OK-6 area) has heated (OK-6:1113.4m; Tbore=261&#176;C, Th=210-221&#176;C). Some inclusions in the Te Kopia drillholes have Th values that exceed Tbore by as much as 50&#176;C, and are deduced to have been uplifted by movement on the Paeroa Fault. Freezing data indicate that the trapped fluid was dilute (~0.2 to 1.7 wt% NaCl equivalent) since most Tm values range from -0.1 to -0.5&#176;C. The outflow portion of the Orakeikorako-Te Kopia system has evolved recently, both chemically and physically. Movement on the Paeroa Fault, that uplifted pyroclastic rocks hosting a quartz-adularia-illite assemblage, combined with a lowering of the watertable has resulted in an overprinting of the neutral pH hydrothermal mineral assemblage by a kaolinite-alunite type assemblage which derives from an acid sulphate fluid. Quartz crystals found 150m above the base of the Paeroa Fault scarp host dilute (~1.5wt% NaCl equivalent) fluid inclusions with Th values that range from 180-206&#176;C (average 196&#176;C). Bladed quartz (after calcite) did not contain usable inclusions. It is deduced that the inclusions formed about 120-160m below the ground, which indicates uplift in the order of ~300m. Assuming a constant rate of uplift of 4m/ka (based on the offset of 330ka Paeroa Ignimbrite), the minimum duration of activity at Te Kopia is 75,000 years.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3360</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Blood pressure, cholesterol and cardiovascular diseases in eastern Asia</field><field name="creator">Rodgers, Anthony</field><field name="description">Background Considerable uncertainty exists about the strength and shape of associations of blood pressure and cholesterol with the risks of stroke, coronary heart disease and total cardiovascular death in eastern Asian populations. Therefore, uncertainty also exists about the size of the likely effects on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity of prolonged exposure changes in these populations. The Eastern Stroke and Coronary Heart Disease Collaborative Project was initiated to determine the associations of usual diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and usual cholesterol with the risks of stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD) and total cardiovascular death in cohort studies from eastern Asia. Methods A collaborative overview of cohort studies included data from 13 cohorts from the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PRC) and five cohorts from Japan, involving a total of 124,774 participants among whom 837,214 person-years were observed. The overall mean age of participants was 47 years, 43% were current smokers and 39% were female. Both parametric and non-parametric analyses were performed, with adjustments made for several potential confounding factors. Efforts were made to correct for the bias introduced by estimation of "usual" DBP and cholesterol from measurements made at baseline (the "regression dilution" bias). The resulting estimates of associations of blood pressure and cholesterol with cardiovascular diseases were combined with data from surveys of blood pressure and cholesterol levels in Asian and other populations, estimates of the incidence of cardiovascular disease, and results from randomised trials of blood pressure and cholesterol lowering treatments to estimate the possible effects of blood pressure and cholesterol lowering. Findings The overall mean DBP at baseline was 78 mmHg. A total of 1,798 strokes were observed, of which about 45% were confirmed by computed tomography (CT) or autopsy. Each 5 mmHg lower usual DBP was associated with about two-fifths lower non-haemorrhagic stroke risk and about one-half lower haemorrhagic stroke risk(-5 mmHg: odds ratio 0.56, 95% Cl: 0.53-0.59 and 0.69, 0.65-0.73, respectively). The risks were continuous throughout the range of DBP studied (baseline DBP 70-114 mmHg, usual DBP 76-97 mmHg). Each 5 mmHg lower usual DBP was associated with almost a halving of total stroke risk (-5 mmHg: 0.56, 0.53-0.59). The risk of CHD was also strongly and positively related to usual DBP (-5 mmHg: 0.73, 0.66-0.80). Since about half of all cardiovascular deaths were due to stroke, they were strongly related to blood pressure with, on average, each 5 mmHg lower usual DBP associated with about one-third fewer such deaths (-5 mmHg: 0.69, 0.65-0.73). The mean cholesterol at baseline was 4.5 mmol/l (174 mg/dl) and disease risks were assessed across a range of cholesterol levels that correspond approximately to the lower two thirds of the distribution in most Western populations (baseline cholesterol 3.4-6.7mmol/l and estimated usual cholesterol 4.15.8mmol/l). There was a trend toward a negative association of usual cholesterol with strokes classified as haemorrhagic (0.6 mmol/l lower usual cholesterol associated with odds ratio of 1.27, 95% confidence limits 0.84-1.91) and a trend toward a positive association with strokes classified as non-haemorrhagic (-0.6 mmol/l: 0.77, 0.57-1.06). The consequence of these two apparently different (P=0.06) associations, was a weak positive association of usual cholesterol with total stroke (-0.6 mmol/l: O.92, 0.72-1.17). in contrast, there was clear evidence of strong positive associations of usual cholesterol with the risks of CHD (_0.6 mmol/l: 0.47,0.31, 0.71) and of total cardiovascular death (_0.6 mmol/l: 0.58, 0.44-0.76).Overall, there was no clear indication of an interaction between the effects of cholesterol and DBP, when assessed on a multiplicative scale. The estimates of the potential effects of blood pressure lowering indicated that a 3 mmHg lower usual DBP should eventually result in about one-third fewer strokes and one-sixth fewer CHD events. If accompanied by a 0.3 mmol/l lower usual cholesterol, then eventually one-third fewer stroke and CHD events should occur. In the PRC alone, such reductions would be expected to avert over half a million deaths annually. Most events would be prevented in those without hypertension or hypercholesterolaemia. World-wide, a 2% reduction in cholesterol levels would avert about 0'5 million (4%) of CHD deaths in 2020. A 2% reduction in DBP would avert an estimated 1.2 million (16%) stroke deaths and 0.6 million (6%) CHD deaths in 2020. Interpretation Blood pressure is a profoundly important determinant of cardiovascular disease in eastern Asian populations. The relationship observed here between blood pressure and total cardiovascular deaths is steeper than that typically observed in Western populations. This difference appears to be largely due to the different composition of cardiovascular deaths in Eastern populations, with a larger proportion of deaths due to conditions that are strongly related to blood pressure, such as haemorrhagic stroke. In these populations with comparatively low cholesterol from eastern Asia, there was no clear evidence of a cholesterol level below which risks of CHD or total cardiovascular death did not continue to decrease. The strength of the association of cholesterol with CHD was similar to that observed in other populations. The results suggest that modest population-wide reductions in these exposures, particularly blood pressure, could avert a large proportion of the substantial and increasing burden of cardiovascular disease in eastern Asian and other populations.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3361</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Induced myopia in the guinea pig: scleral myofibroblasts and biomechanics</field><field name="creator">Backhouse, Simon</field><field name="description">Aims: To determine the effect of induced myopia on the in vivo scleral biomechanical properties and scleral cell populations in the guinea pig. Methods: One week old guinea pigs were monocularly deprived of form vision (MD) for 14 days. Cycloplegic refractive error was measured with an IR Optometer, and the results analysed using power vectors and linear mixed modelling. The in vivo ocular biomechanical response was investigated by raising the IOP to 50 mmHg for one hour in anaesthetised animals. A-scan ultrasound measures of axial length were taken every 10 minutes with raised IOP, and after returning IOP to 15 mmHg. The total cell population (DAPI antibody) and myofibroblast population (&#945;-SMA antibody) was determined in transverse scleral sections from the posterior 100 degrees of each eye. Results: The average relative myopic refractive error induced was -4.06 &#177; 0.35 D, which was mainly the result of vitreous chamber depth (VCD) elongation. This was confirmed by a negative correlation between mean sphere and VCD (R2 = 0.4295). On increasing the IOP the deprived and control eyes showed rapid viscoelastic expansion of the VCD that normal eyes did not show. When the increased IOP was maintained the deprived and control eyes showed lower creep rates than normal eyes. Myofibroblasts were shown to be present in guinea pig sclera, as previously observed in human and tree shrew sclera. On average, approximately 64% of the scleral cells were myofibroblasts. The induction of myopia had minimal effect on the cell populations, except for a decrease in total cell numbers in the 10&#176; region equivalent to the location of scleral crescent formation in myopic human eyes. Conclusions: Ahigh proportion of scleral cells show contractile potential in the guinea pig. Form deprivation appears to minimally affect cell numbers, except in the region equivalent to scleral crescent formation in myopic human eyes. However, the in vivo viscoelastic response of the VCD in deprived eyes differs from that in normal eyes, suggesting some factor(s) other than cell number alone has a role in axial length control.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3377</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of Rotenone and 6-OHDA on Dopaminergic Neurons of the Substantia Nigra Studied In Vitro</field><field name="creator">Freestone, Peter Stuart</field><field name="description">This study investigated the neurotoxic effects of rotenone and 6-hyroxydopamine (6 OHDA), two compounds which have been implicated in Parkinson&#8217;s disease (PD). PD is a neurodegenerative disorder that results in the impairment of movement. During the disease process, a group of dopamine-containing cells in the brain region called the Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNc), degenerate. Whilst genetic factors contribute to approximately 5% of PD cases, the causes of the remaining 95% are unknown. What does seem clear is the pivotal role of mitochondrial dysfunction as observed in post-mortem human tissue. Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to energy depletion and the generation of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, despite the fact that the involvement of mitochondria in the disease process has been well established, the cellular events that lead to, and result from, mitochondrial dysfunction remain poorly understood. Rotenone and 6 OHDA have been implicated in PD for two reasons: (1) both toxins can relatively selectively kill SNc neurons in animal models of PD, and (2) there is evidence for both compounds having a potential causative role in the etiology of the disease in humans. When 6 OHDA is injected into the brain, or rotenone applied systemically, both toxins cause degeneration of SNc neurons. This ability makes them excellent tools for studying mechanisms of PD in animal models. In addition, both toxins inhibit mitochondrial function. Despite extensive use in models of PD, the mechanisms by which each toxin cause cell damage remains elusive. The first part of this study investigated the acute responses of dopaminergic SNc neurons to rotenone exposure (5 nM &#8211; 1 &#181;M). The experiments were conducted on brain slices obtained from rats. Electrophysiological recordings (whole-cell patch-clamp technique) were used to detect activation of specific membrane channels as well as cell firing and changes to the membrane potential. In addition, imaging of several fluorescent dyes sensitive to specific cellular events was carried out. In voltage-clamp experiments, acute rotenone (200 nM &#8211; 1 &#181;M) application evoked a concentration-dependent outward current which was mediated by tolbutamide-sensitive KATP channels. The current was associated with a drop in cell input resistance (Rm) and, in current-clamp, membrane hyperpolarization and inhibition of spontaneous action potentials. The mechanisms by which rotenone activates KATP channels is controversial, with some studies suggesting activation by ATP depletion and others by elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS). To address this issue, experiments were conducted with high levels of ATP in the pipette solution. Since the rotenone-induced outward current was unaffected by high ATP levels, it was concluded that KATP channel activation was due to oxidative stress. Indeed, the antioxidant Trolox significantly attenuated the current response. Confirmation of elevated ROS production was obtained by recording increased mitochondrial superoxide production, using the fluorescent dye MitoSOX. In addition, rotenone evoked depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential (&#916;&#936;m). Measurements of intracellular Ca2+ and Na+ were performed using the fluorescent dyes Fura 2 and SBFI, respectively. Rotenone evoked increases to both [Ca2+]i and [Na+]i in a concentration-dependent manner. The rotenone-induced [Ca2+]i rise was unaffected by blocking KATP channels with Cs+. The elevation of [Ca2+]i is particularly important in relation to cell death, since [Ca2+]i overload is known to activate pathways leading to necrosis and apoptosis. There has been growing interest in the synergistic action of rotenone with other toxins/conditions which also enhance [Ca2+]i. This concept was explored in the present study by testing the relationship between the baseline [Ca2+]i level and the rotenone-induced [Ca2+]i increase. Two approaches were taken. Firstly, baseline [Ca2+]i was deliberately raised by activation of voltage-gated calcium channels. When rotenone was applied in the presence of this raised baseline calcium level, the rotenone-induced [Ca2+]i rise was significantly greater. The second approach involved post-hoc analysis of the relationship between the normal cellular variation in baseline [Ca2+]i and the rotenone-induced [Ca2+]i elevation. This analysis also revealed a dependency of the rotenone-induced [Ca2+]i elevation on the baseline calcium level. From this finding, as well as the observation that rotenone evoked ROS production, Transient Receptor Protein subtype M2 (TRPM2) channels were proposed as the likely underlying mechanism. The potentiation of the rotenone-induced [Ca2+]i rise by an elevation in baseline calcium level can be attributed to the calcium-dependence of ROS-sensitive TRPM2 channels, known to respond with increased channel opening to increased [Ca2+]i. Recent findings from our laboratory have confirmed TRPM2 involvement in rotenone toxicity, since blockade of these channels with ACA reduced the rotenone-induced [Ca2+]i rise (K. Chung, unpublished). Imaging using the fluorescent dye propidium iodide (PI) to label cells with compromised membrane integrity was also conducted in acute midbrain slices. SNc neurons were retrograde-labelled with FluoroGold and then exposed to various toxic insults. The detergent Triton-X100 caused an increase in PI labelling, whilst rotenone and high concentrations of glutamate were ineffective over the period of time investigated (up to 40 min). The second part of this study, also conducted on acute rat midbrain slices, investigated the acute responses of SNc neurons to 6 OHDA (0.2 &#8211; 2 mM) exposure. Extracellular recordings of action potential firing were conducted on SNc neurons. 6 OHDA evoked rapid inhibition of firing in a similar manner to dopamine (100 &#181;M). In the presence of D2 dopamine receptor blocker sulpiride, the inhibition of firing evoked by 6 OHDA was delayed, and an initial increase of firing was observed. Blockade of the dopamine transporter with nomifensine reduced the 6 OHDA-induced inhibition of firing, and prevented the persistent inhibition of firing after 6 OHDA washout. For comparison, the response to 6 OHDA of non-dopaminergic neurons in the subthalamic nucleus was also studied. In the subthalamic nucleus, 6 OHDA evoked an increase of spontaneous action potential firing. Rapid application of 6 OHDA (using the picospritz application technique) in voltage-clamp recorded SNc neurons evoked an outward current, similar to that observed after dopamine application. In the presence of sulpiride, 6 OHDA induced an inward current, consistent with the initial increase of firing activity observed in extracellular recordings. Microfluorometric experiments with Fura 2, showed that 6 OHDA evokes an increase in [Ca2+]i. Loading cells with the fluorescent dye Lucifer Yellow enabled visualization of 6 OHDA-induced swelling of the cell body and damage to proximal dendrites. Imaging of SNc neurons loaded with dextran-rhodamine revealed 6 OHDA-induced damage of distal dendrites. The last part of the study was performed on organotypic cultures obtained from slices of the ventral midbrain. These cultures were prepared from newborn transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the tyrosine hydroxylase-promoter. This fluorescent marker enabled easy identification of dopamine-containing cells (including SNc neurons). Only preliminary experiments were carried out using this preparation. GFP-positive neurons did not show the classic membrane hyperpolarization in response to dopamine. For comparison, recordings from GFP-positive SNc neurons in acute slices obtained from age-matched animals did show a typical hyperpolarizing response to dopamine. GFP-neurons from organotypic cultures also lacked the Ih current &#8211; another characteristic feature of SNc neurons in vivo or in acute brain slices. In addition, atypical responses to CNQX (blocker of NMDA receptors) and baclofen (blocker of GABAB receptors) application were identified in GFP-positive neurons. These results demonstrate that the culturing process used in this study alters the functional &#8216;phenotype&#8217; of dopaminergic neurons, a change which needs to be considered in future studies using this preparation. Chronic exposure of organotypic cultures to low concentration of rotenone (50 nM) evoked a delayed increase of PI labelling indicative of cell death, however technical limitations prevented detection of PI co-localization with GFP was observed. In conclusion, this study identified several key aspects of 6 OHDA and rotenone toxicity in SNc neurons. The most significant novel findings include evidence for ROS activation of KATP channels, presumed involvement of TRPM2 channels in rotenone-induced [Ca2+]i rise, and dopamine-analogous effects of 6 OHDA. The controversial role of KATP channels in neuroprotection was addressed. Findings from this study suggest therapies targeting this channel alone would be of little benefit. The proposed involvement of TRPM2 channels in rotenone-induced [Ca2+]i overload in SNc neurons is particularly interesting as it provides a mechanism for synergism between rotenone and other factors that disrupt [Ca2+]i homeostasis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parkinson's Disease</field><field name="subject">Neurotoxicity</field><field name="subject">Intracellular Calcium</field><field name="subject">Reactive Oxygen Species</field><field name="subject">Mitochondria</field><field name="subject">Electrophysiology</field><field name="subject">TRPM2</field><field name="subject">KATP</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3378</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology and management of alligator weed,  Alternanthera philoxeroides</field><field name="creator">Bassett, Imogen Eleanor</field><field name="description">Invasive plant species in natural ecosystems have been shown to have a wide range of potential impacts on community composition and ecosystem function. Alligator weed (Alternanthera philoxeroides) is invasive in New Zealand and elsewhere. An aggressive competitor and difficult to control, its impacts in productive ecosystems are widely documented. However, little information exists about alligator weed&#8217;s effects in natural ecosystems. This thesis therefore investigated potential effects of alligator weed on decomposition and nutrient cycling, as well as on invertebrate and plant communities in a &#8220;native&#8221; ecosystem, thus integrating effects on ecosystem processes and community composition. These aspects were compared between vegetation dominated by alligator weed or by one of two native sedges, Isolepis prolifer and Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani, in a northern New Zealand lake. In addition, the potential of shading to control alligator weed was assessed. Herbivory by the biocontrol agent Agasicles hygrophila resulted in substantial alligator weed defoliation, differing in timing and magnitude from biomass dynamics of the native sedges. Alligator weed also decomposed faster than either native sedge. Changes in decomposition dynamics led to a shift towards fungivore dominated beetle communities. This illustrates the potentially complex ecosystem effects of biocontrol agents as well as invasive weeds. Alligator weed decomposition rates and invertebrate communities were more similar to those of I. prolifer than S. tabernaemontani. This pattern was attributed to the greater chemical and architectural similarity of alligator weed to I. prolifer compared with S. tabernaemontani. Invasive plants&#8217; impacts may thus be partially influenced by the degree of similarity between the invasive species and the dominant vegetation they invade. Alligator weed was associated with decreased cover of native plants, potentially placing them at greater risk of local extinction. Greenhouse and field experiments showed that shading significantly reduced alligator weed growth. However, clonal support from unshaded areas, and competitive release from less shade tolerant plants, may potentially impede the success of shade based control. This research demonstrates that alligator weed can have a range of complex and multi-trophic effects in a natural ecosystem. Further, characteristics of both invasive and competing vegetation can influence the success of cultural control methods such as shading.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Invasive species</field><field name="subject">Decomposition</field><field name="subject">Invertebrate</field><field name="subject">Ecology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3395</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What is the added value of coordination?:an institutional analysis of the United Nations' response to national and regional coordination of human trafficking in the Greater Mekong Subregion</field><field name="creator">Miller, Rebecca Janine</field><field name="description">Since the 1990s, complex global problems such as HIV/AIDS, humanitarian crises, environmental degradation, and human trafficking have presented challenges at scales that transcend the nation-state as a focus for development initiatives. These challenges, in concert with the emergence of new public management rationalities and good governance discourses, have altered the mandates and capacities of different development agencies from NGOs to governments and United Nations (UN) agencies. The UN has the potential to become a leader for coordinated responses, which are seen as a prerequisite for resolving these issues. However, the marketisation and fragmentation of the development field has engendered an environment fraught with complexity, instability, and heightened competitiveness over scarce resources. The problematic nature of coordinating the activities of stakeholders in such an environment is not well understood. Effective coordination must marry ideals of cooperation to the different and often competing interests of stakeholders and to field-based development practices structured along marketised and disaggregated lines. In this thesis I explore what is meant by coordination, how it is being institutionalised, and what can be done to make initiatives more effective. This thesis examines the institutional arrangements devised to coordinate the practices of agencies working to combat human trafficking in the Greater Mekong Subregion. It analyses the institutional forms themselves and the practices that have emerged from them. Using an ethnographic institutional approach, I focus on the workings of a UN Inter-Agency Project (UNIAP) designed to facilitate a coordinated response to human trafficking. My research draws on over 70 interviews with practitioners and government representatives from six countries, as well as close examination of project documents. To analyse this material and the institutional contexts in which they are embedded, I draw upon strands of new institutionalism and the conceptual tools of Pierre Bourdieu. I argue that the structure of the development field itself is not conducive to coordination. However, realising the potential that does exist will require that consultative platforms be built more on incentives (accumulation and exchange of resources) than on trust, equal participation, and neutral power relations. The findings suggest moving beyond the processes of market exchange toward a more realistic appraisal of hierarchies, markets, and networks as modes of governance and coordination.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3396</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology of spiny lobsters (Jasus edwardsii) on fished and unfished reefs</field><field name="creator">Freeman, Debbie</field><field name="description">Knowledge of the interactions among species and communities is vital for their management and protection.  Increasingly, the role of marine protected areas in this regard is being recognised, primarily because of the potential for previously-harvested species to increase in density and biomass, and the linkages among species to be restored.  Monitoring and research was conducted within and surrounding two marine reserves on the east coast of the North Island of New Zealand &#8211; Te Tapuwae o Rongokako, near Gisborne, and Te Angiangi, south of Napier.  The aim was to describe the biological characteristics of spiny lobsters (Jasus edwardsii) in the absence of fishing, and to describe the effects of fishing and protection on lobster populations and the communities of which they are a component.  Diver and pot surveys showed that lobsters were significantly more abundant within the reserves than in the surrounding fisheries and that the populations were comprised of a larger proportion of legal-sized individuals.  Higher female fecundity within Te Tapuwae o Rongokako Marine Reserve compared with the surrounding fishery was proposed to be primarily a result of increased availability of large males within the reserve.  The impact of the fishery on lobsters was also evidenced in the lower tail width to carapace length ratio of the fished population compared to the population within Te Tapuwae o Rongokako Marine Reserve, due to the minimum legal size for Jasus edwardsii in New Zealand being based on tail width.  The largest tagging study ever to be conducted in a New Zealand marine reserve showed that sublegal male lobsters within Te Tapuwae o Rongokako Marine Reserve were growing on average faster than the same sized individuals outside the reserve, potentially as a result of the effects of handling and / or size-selective fishing.  A decrease in growth rate over time was recorded in male lobsters within the reserve, which coincided with an increase in catch per unit effort and may indicate that density-dependent effects are operating.  Distinct seasonal movements of tagged lobsters were recorded, with the vast majority of movements taking place within reefs.  Where the boundaries of the reserve crossed reef habitat, significant movement of lobsters across the boundaries occurred.  Lobsters within Te Tapuwae o Rongokako Marine Reserve not only exhibited cannibalistic behaviour but foraged during the day, including on intertidal reef platforms at high tide, potentially as a behavioural response to increased competition for food &#8211; behaviour not previously reported for this species.  Outside the reserve, lobster bait apparently provided an alternative protein source but despite this supplementation of diet, these lobsters were in poorer nutritional condition, as evidenced by their lower body weights relative to carapace length and tail width for both sexes.  Lobsters outside the reserve were also significantly more affected by a bacterial infection associated with handling, than lobsters within the reserve.  These findings have significant implications for fisheries management and for the design and management of marine protected areas (MPAs).  This study demonstrates that many of the biological parameters used in evaluating harvest strategies in the New Zealand lobster fishery may be biased unless collected from populations with a natural size structure, such as may occur within marine protected areas.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lobster</field><field name="subject">marine reserves</field><field name="subject">MPAs</field><field name="subject">effects of fishing</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270504 Invertebrate biology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3363</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The incidence and phylogenetic analysis of viruses infecting New Zealand's native grasses</field><field name="creator">Delmiglio, Catia.</field><field name="description">Grasses form the basis for the meat, dairy, wool and deer industries, which contribute to nearly 50% of New Zealand exports, and are also an important component of natural ecosystems. Worldwide &gt;100 plant viruses infect grass species and even mild and symptomless infections can adversely effect plant populations through reduced reproductive rates and greater susceptibility to environmental extremes. The only previously published study on viruses in New Zealand&#8217;s natural grasslands found that cereal viruses have invaded the native grass flora of the South Island. This research provided an extensive survey of New Zealand native grasses, showing that barley yellow dwarf virus diseases (BYDV, Luteoviridae) and Cocksfoot mottle virus (CoMV, Sobemovirus) are widespread in the North and South islands of New Zealand. Significant findings include seven new virus hosts amongst the New Zealand native flora, the first report of BYDV-PAS in New Zealand, detection in Hierochloe redolens of a novel virus in the Luteoviridae family (proposed name BYDV-To), and in Festuca novae-zelandiae a novel dsRNA virus possibly belonging to the Partitiviridae family. New virus host reports in New Zealand include CoMV in Poa anceps, P. cita, F. novae-zelandiae, and Chionochloa rubra; BYDV-PAV and BYDV-PAS in Microlaena stipoides and Dichelacne crinita; BYDV-MAV in P. cita, F. novae-zelandiae and H. redolens; and CYDV-RPV in P. cita and M. stipoides. Molecular techniques for virus detection and identification were developed or improved during this study. Phylogenetic analyses of viral coat protein sequences from native and exotic grass species indicate either frequent or recent virus movement into native ecosystems, and multiple virus introduction events in New Zealand. The likely origins of the virus species are discussed. Two CoMV variants were identified, one of which caused severe necrosis in susceptible cocksfoot cultivars. Reciprocal aphid transmission of BYDV-PAV using cereals and native grasses showed that although transmission to natives was low, the efficiency of transmission from natives to cereals was comparable to that between cereal species, suggesting virus adaptation to the cereal host species. The findings from this study are discussed in respect to disease management and bio-security in New Zealand, and recommendations are made for future research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3364</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure function studies on lectin nucleotide phosphohydrolases (LNPs)</field><field name="creator">Chen, Chunhong</field><field name="description">Lectin nucleotide phosphohydrolases (LNPs) are proteins which possess both apyrase catalytic activity (E.C. 3.6.1.5) and specific carbohydrate binding properties, and these are linked. To investigate the structural and functional properties for these proteins, two putative soluble plant LNPs, 4WC and 7WC (from white clover), and a putative soluble plant apyrase 6RG (from ryegrass) were chosen. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies for each plant apyrase were generated using highly purified, overexpressed recombinant 4WC or 7WC. In the case of 6RG, the C-terminal half of the protein constituted the best antigen for generating polyclonal antibodies. These antibodies showed high specificity and sensitivity. Active, recombinant 4WC and 6RG were overexpressed and purified using the baculoviral insect cell expression system (4WCbac-sup and 6RG:Hisbac), while 7WC (7WCcoli) was produced from E. coli inclusion bodies and subsequently refolded to give active enzyme. In course of overexpression, recombinant 4WC was localised in both the cellular fraction (4WCbac) and in the media supernatant (4WCbac-sup), while recombinant 6RG:Hisbac was only found in the cellular fraction (6RG:Hisbac) indicating that it was not secreted during insect cell growth. Secretion of 4WCbac was found to be dependent on N-glycosylation at N313 but not at N85 and elimination of one or both of these sites appeared to have little influence on apyrase activity. In addition, both 4WCbac and 6RG:Hisbac from the cellular fraction were fully functional. These results were compared with similar work performed on the animal ecto-apyrases which have different specific N-glycosylation sites required for secretion and activity. The 4WCbac-sup, 7WCcoli and 6RG:Hisbac proteins all showed apyrase activity, that is they catalysed the hydrolysis of nucleotide tri- and/or di-phosphates to their corresponding nucleotide monophosphates, and released inorganic phosphate in a divalent cation-dependent manner. However, the proteins exhibited different activities, substrate specificities, pH profiles and influence of inhibitors: 4WCbac-sup had a preference for NDPs with a pH optimum &#8805;9.5; 7WCcoli had a modest preference for NTPs with a pH optimum at 8.5; 6RG:Hisbac was almost exclusively an NTPase with a pH optimum at 6.5. Contrary to predictions based on phylogeny the proteins all bound to sulphated disaccharides and their catalytic activities were influenced both positively and negatively by the binding of specific chitosans. The data indicates that all three soluble plant apyrases investigated here were LNPs, in contrast to predictions from the literature. In order to pinpoint the regions responsible for determining substrate specificity and chitosan binding, chimeras were made using the N- and C-terminal halves of 4WC and 6RG. This resulted in fully functional reciprocal chimeras. Comparison of the apyrase activity for parents and chimeras, substrate specificity, optimal pH, influence of inhibitors on activity and effects of chitosans indicated that the C-terminus was responsible for determining substrate specificity. However, the influence of specific chitosans on the chimeras appeared to be dependent on both the N- and C-terminal portions of the proteins. In addition, chimeras were found to bind to the same sulphated disaccharides as the parent proteins. Preliminary crystal screening experiments were performed with highly purified preparations of 7WCcoli and 6RG:Hisbac. Under specific conditions 7WCcoli was found to form cube-like crystalline arrangements while 6RG:Hisbac formed hexagonal-like crystalline structures. A potential model for carbohydrate binding by LNPs is proposed and the possible biological roles of plant LNPs are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Apyrase</field><field name="subject">lectin</field><field name="subject">prokaryotic and eukaryotic protein expression</field><field name="subject">chimeras</field><field name="subject">glycosylation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology::270108 Enzymes</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3369</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maximizing Information: Applications of Ideal Point Modeling and Innovative Item Design to Personality Measurement</field><field name="creator">Leeson, Heidi Vanessa</field><field name="description">Recent research has challenged the way in which personality and attitude constructs are measured. Alternatives have been offered as to how non-cognitive responses are modeled, the mode of delivery used when administrating such scales, and the impact of technology in measuring personality. Thus, the major purpose of the studies in this thesis concerns two interrelated issues of personality research, namely the way personality responses are best modeled, and the most optimal mode by which personality items are presented and associated modal issues. Three studies are presented. First, recent developments using an ideal point approach to scale construction are outlined, and an empirical study compares modeling personality items based on an ideal point approach (generalized graded unfolding model; GGUM) and a dominance approach (graded response model: GRM). Second, an extensive review of literature pertaining to the mode effect when transferring paper-and-pencil measures to screen was conducted, in addition to a review of the various types of computerized and innovative items and their associated psychometric information. Finally, nine innovative items were developed using various multimedia features (e.g., video, graphics, and audio) to ascertain the advantages of these methods to present items constructed to elicit response behavior underlying ideal point approaches, namely, typical response behavior. It was found that the dominance IRT model continued to produce superior model-data fit for most items, more attention needs to be placed on developing principles for constructing ideal point type items, the web-based version supplied 20% more construct information than the paper version, and innovative items seem to provide more data-model fit for students with lower personality attributes. While the innovative items may require more initial outlay in terms of time and development costs, they have the capacity to provide more information regarding test-takers&#8217; personality levels, potentially using fewer items.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ideal Point Theory</field><field name="subject">Innovative items</field><field name="subject">Web-based testing</field><field name="subject">Computer-based testing</field><field name="subject">Personality measurement</field><field name="subject">Psychometrics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330109 Assessment and evaluation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330107 Educational technology and media</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3405</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polynesian architecture in New Zealand.</field><field name="creator">Austin, Michael Robert</field><field name="description">Polynesian architecture has tended to be neglected or dismissed as a field of serious study by architects in New Zealand.

Through better communication and considering the structure and foundation as an integrated system, new opportunities may arise for achieving superior performance. This thesis investigates the seismic performance of the integrated system through the development of integrated structure-foundation models using the Ruaumoko structural analysis program. A detailed representation of the structural and foundation systems was created using Ruaumoko, providing insight into the response of a range of integrated structure-foundation systems during seismic loading. In developing both shallow and deep foundation models, some modifications were made to Ruaumoko elements in order to improve the foundation model, but generally existing element configurations were used to represent foundations. Multiple structural and foundation designs were developed using a range of approaches. Use of a range of shallow foundation design methods identified the significant impact that moment loading had on foundation performance. Partial uplift of footings was identified as detrimental to footing performance as it shifted the rotational axes, increasing moment loads and reducing effective footing area. Pinned connections between the structure and shallow footings eliminated these effects at the expense of significant redistribution of actions in the structure and increased displacements. Variation of soil conditions showed that softer soil was most likely to reduce demands on the structure at the expense of foundation non-linearity. Reduced stiffness and increased radiation damping characteristics of raft foundations compared to footing foundation systems reduced the demands on three storey structures for all soil conditions. Increased structural demands were identified for the ten storey structure as a result of the reduced impact of foundation characteristics on the response of the integrated system. The level of rotational restraint at the head of pile foundations had a considerable effect on the structure and the foundation, with free-head piles developing the largest pile displacements and actions. Reduced rotational stiffness caused a substantial change in the distribution of structural actions, while increasing rotational restraint moved the characteristics closer to the response of fixed base models. Softer soil conditions greatly increased non-linearity in the foundation soil without any definitive improvement in structural performance.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Earthquake Engineering</field><field name="subject">Soil Structure Interaction</field><field name="subject">Analytical Modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3428</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leaving a lot to be desired? Sex therapy and the discourses of heterosex</field><field name="creator">Guerin, Bernadette M.</field><field name="description">In this thesis I explore the social construction of sexuality and sexual dysfunction. Interviews were undertaken with 20 sex therapists practising in Aotearoa/New Zealand in order to elicit accounts of contemporary sex therapy practice in the local context. Using a feminist poststructuralist lens, I explicate and critically examine the dominant discourses informing the construction of sex therapy, and heterosexual sexual relations, and what these discourses enable and constrain. I draw attention to some of the assumptions embedded in the construction of the sexual dysfunctions in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR, APA, 2000), and in accounts of sex therapy practice, examining the ways in which these are based on taken-for-granted norms of (hetero)sexuality and highlighting the differently enabled gendered sexual subjectivities they (re)produce. Although there are nine sexual dysfunctions identified in the DSM-IV-TR, all of which I briefly outline in Chapter Four, I restrict my focus in the analytical chapters to the conceptualisation and treatment of vaginismus, orgasm difficulties in women, discrepancies in desire and, relatedly, the gendering of desire through powerful sociocultural discourses and representations. I pay particular attention to the implications of these for heterosexual women&#8217;s sexuality. I also explore some of the generic concepts that dominate the construction of therapy at a broader level than that of sex therapy alone, arguing that while these offer some useful ways of framing therapy they also constrain therapy practice in important ways. Through a critical review of the sex therapy literature and accounts of practice from those interviewed, I contend that contemporary sex therapy tends to reify dominant cultural and sexological norms rather than challenge them. My analyses show that the dominant discourses informing constructions of sex therapy and heterosexual sexual relations produce particular types of sex as normal whilst marginalizing sexual acts or practices that fall outside of such restrictive parameters. In particular, I argue that the genital-coital-orgasm construct that is hegemonic within sex therapy restricts possibilities for alternative erotic pleasures and possibilities amongst heterosexuals whilst contributing to the invisibilization of sexual identities other than heterosexual. Accounts of sex therapy practice that were able to contest such framings are also highlighted. Because these came from sex therapists drawing on radical feminist or feminist poststructuralist discourses, I suggest that these discourses offer important possibilities for a deconstructive (sex) therapy practice that is able to challenge an often inequitable sexual status quo. Attention is also drawn to the significant constraints which act to restrict clients&#8217; choices and possibilities for sex therapists to practise in more critically questioning ways. I conclude this thesis with an &#8216;invitation to reflection&#8217; where I briefly discuss some deconstructive approaches that I have found useful for developing ongoing reflexive analysis of my own taken-for-granted assumptions in the area of sexuality, and for aiding my thinking about therapeutic practices that support my political and theoretical commitments and that attend to some of the issues outlined in this thesis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social construction of sexuality</field><field name="subject">social constructionism</field><field name="subject">feminist poststructuralism</field><field name="subject">feminist poststructuralist approach to sexuality</field><field name="subject">sexual dysfunction</field><field name="subject">sexual disorders</field><field name="subject">heterosexual sexual relations</field><field name="subject">sexuality</field><field name="subject">heterosex</field><field name="subject">dominant discourses of sexuality</field><field name="subject">sex therapy</field><field name="subject">deconstruction of sex therapy practices</field><field name="subject">orgasm difficulties</field><field name="subject">vaginismus</field><field name="subject">desire discrepancy</field><field name="subject">gendering of desire</field><field name="subject">deconstructive approaches to sex therapy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3454</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical and numerical modelling of bacterial colony growth on high nutrient surfaces</field><field name="creator">Pipe, Leonie Zandra</field><field name="description">Traditionally, growth and morphology studies of bacteria have focused on individual cells. When microbiologists subsequently became interested in bacterial colony growth, they investigated the dynamics of its height as well as those of its diameter. The models they proposed, however, were little more than empirical. In recent decades there has been a shift in focus, as researchers became interested instead in the morphology changes that colonies undergo when exposed to stressful environments such as nutrient and moisture limitation. As a result of this shift, models of colony growth in three dimensions have remained underdeveloped and rudimentary. My first task in this thesis was to assemble a sufficiently comprehensive data set from which diameter, height and cell-number growth trends in colonies could be properly analysed. This was achieved by studying the growth of many colonies of two bacterial species, Serratia marcescens and Esherichia coli, on high-nutrient non-selective agar, over a range of incubation temperatures, over periods ranging from two hours to one week. When graphed and analysed, colony diameter and colony height growth turned out to be most economically described as power-law in time, with exponent &lt; 1. This contrasts with the claims of previous researchers, who had described both growth trends as linear, with diameter switching to a slower yet still linear growth after a certain time, and height growth ceasing altogether. From my results, I proposed a simple conceptual model, an extension of a model developed by Pirt in 1967. My hypothesis was that, in colonies growing on high-nutrient surfaces, diffusion was the dominant factor in colony growth. Ron Keam transformed my conceptual model into a mathematical one, from which I have developed one-dimensional and twodimensional numerical simulations. In all simulations to date, in both one and two dimensions, a power-law growth phase emerges as a consequence of nutrient-controlled growth, preceded by an &#8220;accelerating&#8221; phase during which colony growth overtakes diffusive processes, and succeeded by a slow transition towards growth cessation as nutrient becomes exhausted. In addition to successful demonstration of the power laws, the model in its final form yields realistic colony profiles and exhibits other features consistent with experimental results reported in the literature.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3445</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Virtual Reality Simulation of Hip Surgery</field><field name="creator">Blyth, Phil</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the design and application of a virtual reality simulator for orthopaedic surgeryof the proximal femur. The aim of the research was to create a simulator with the followingattributes; could be used within the current public hospital setting, reflected the perceived needs ofthe local orthopaedic community, provided surgically relevant feedback about aspects of technicalability to orthopaedic surgical trainees and the training committee, allowed practice of operativetasks which for reasons of radiation exposure could otherwise not occur, was validated, and couldbe developed further for other operations. The ultimate aim of the simulator is to allow trainees topractice aspects of surgical treatment such that their care of real patients is improved. The novel aspect of this work has been the development of a simulator which allows the trainee toperform all the steps required for two surgical procedures; namely hip fracture fixation and pinningof slipped femoral capital epiphyses. The simulator runs on the computers found within the publichospital as it does not require expensive hardware such as haptic (force feedback) devices. Resultsfrom the simulator mimic real world measurements which are seldom available to trainees asfeedback to enable them to practice their craft. A survey of the New Zealand orthopaedic surgeons and advanced trainees showed this communitywas generally supportive of simulation, though only 4 respondents had previous experience with asurgical simulator. The task of practicing angulation/spatial orientation was thought most suitablefor simulation, which is the task which the simulator specifically allows trainees to practice. Morerecently qualified surgeons were more likely to agree that simulation was an effective way topractice surgical procedures. Validation of the simulator was tested in two experiments. The simulator was shown to have facevalidity; i.e. a realistic representation of the operating room. This result was obtained by surveyingusers who had completed a number of virtual operations. Construct validity was assessed by thesimulator&#8217;s ability to identify between groups of users with differing levels of real surgicalexperience. The simulator was able to discriminate medical students from orthopaedic trainees,despite the medical students&#8217; greater ability in computer-gaming. Advanced trainees generallyperformed better than basic trainees, though in the limited number of trainees available significancewas not reached. Finally the simulator was developed further to allow all advanced trainees within New Zealand tocomplete virtual pin placement of a slipped capital femoral epiphysis. This demonstrated thefeasibility of using the simulator for assessment of trainees within their normal training weekend. Italso revealed different operating styles, and showed how these differing styles do not correlate withthe accuracy with which the final screw is placed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Virtual Reality</field><field name="subject">Simulation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4235</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The substance of the shadow: M&#257;ori and P&#257;keh&#257; political economic relationships, 1860-1940: a far northern case study</field><field name="creator">Puckey, Adrienne, 1946</field><field name="description">Between 1860 and 1940 Aotearoa New Zealand&#8217;s economy and economic base was transformed in a number of significant ways, following similar patterns in earlier-established British colonies. The influx of European immigrants drastically altered the demography and contested land &#8211; the economic base. Money became increasingly important as medium of exchange and unit of account. Whereas the economy was unregulated or lightly-regulated before 1860, regulation increasingly formalised economic relations and institutions, and work organisation became more impersonal. In urban areas these transformations were substantially complete by 1940. However, in rural areas, where most M&#228;ori and fewer P&#228;keh&#228; lived, economic transformation was more of a hybrid than a complete change from one form to another. The informal economy (unmeasured and unregulated), and particularly the rural informal economy, contributed (and still contributes) quantitatively to the national economy. Whether within M&#228;ori communities, within P&#228;keh&#228; communities or between the two, the more informal rural economy depended on social relations to a large extent. M&#228;ori had choices about how they related to the introduced economic system, ranging from full engagement to rejection and non-involvement, with numerous negotiated positions in between. With the conviction that they could satisfactorily negotiate terms of participation, M&#228;ori had invited Europeans to the far north. The extent of M&#228;ori involvement in all the dominant (formal) economic activities of the far north, 1860-1940, clearly indicates their efforts were integral rather than peripheral to the P&#228;keh&#228; economy. But M&#228;ori economic activity has been relegated to the shadows of economic history. The relationship between the two systems is better understood by recognising the interplay between formal and informal (shadow) economies. The social organisation of work, the kaupapa of the informal economy, the diversity of strategies and tactics, and relationship building (both bonding and bridging), were the strengths from which far northern M&#228;ori relentlessly engaged with the P&#228;keh&#228; economy, while maintaining a degree of autonomy until World War One. In effect they played an invisible hand of cards, invisible, that is, to studies of the formal economy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies::430101 History: New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies::430102 History: Maori</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3387</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robust and integrated airline scheduling</field><field name="creator">Weide, Oliver</field><field name="description">In airline scheduling a variety of planning and operational decision problems have to be solved. In this thesis we consider the problems aircraft routing and crew pairing: aircraft and crew must be allocated to flights of a schedule in a minimal cost way.  Although these problems are not independent, they are usually formulated as independent mathematical optimisation models and solved sequentially. This approach might lead to a suboptimal allocation of aircraft and crew, since a solution of one of the problems may restrict the set of feasible solutions of the problem solved subsequently.  Also, in minimal cost solutions, aircraft and crew are highly utilised and short turn around times are usually used for aircraft and crew. If such a solution is used in operations, a short delay of one flight can cause very severe disruptions of the schedule later in the day due to the lack of buffer times. We formulate an integrated aircraft routing and crew pairing  model that can generate solutions that incur small costs and are also robust to typical stochastic variability in airline operations.  We propose two new solution methods to solve the integrated model. The first approach is an optimisation based heuristic approach that is capable of generating good quality solutions quickly, the second approach can solve the integrated model to optimality.  In an extension of the integrated model we allow the departure times of some flights in the schedule to vary in some time window. This creates additional flexibility that leads to aircraft routing and crew pairing solutions with improved cost and robustness compared to the integrated model without time windows.  Using data from domestic Air New Zealand schedules, we evaluate the benefits of the approaches on real world problem instances. Our solutions satisfy all rules imposed for these problems and are ready to be implemented in practice. We generate solutions that dramatically improve the cost and robustness of solutions obtained by existing methods.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">airline scheduling</field><field name="subject">robust</field><field name="subject">integrated</field><field name="subject">set partitioning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4237</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accessing the in between: The conditions of possibility emerging from interactions with information and communications technologies in Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mitchell, Phillipa Marlis</field><field name="description">The complex interactions between individuals, institutions and information and communications technologies (ICTs) have generated a growing body of research that seeks greater knowledge of the processes at work and their consequences. Situated firmly within this area, this thesis challenges the dominance of the generalised and largely technologically deterministic narratives within the field by seeking to constitute such knowledge in a different way.  Geography provides a useful standpoint from which to challenge these narratives owing to its enduring engagement with time and space, concepts implicit in any discussion of ICTs effects.  Emerging work on code space, transurbanism and timespace are specifically used to negate the persistent dualistic treatment of time and space which is argued to be hampering geographic research in this field.  Methodologically drawing from a non representational style this thesis uses these emerging understandings to access the in between, a mental space of performance; which involves the process of drawing from tacit knowledge, cognitive perceptions of the spatial and temporal environment and emotions, in order to explore the conditions of possibility that individuals are becoming aware of through their interactions with ICTs.  Four empirical interventions are used to ground these emerging understandings into the reality of everyday encounters with ICTs in Auckland, New Zealand.  The first focuses on the role of local government in the development of Auckland&#8217;s ICT infrastructure, a complex and contingent process.  The second concentrates on the provision of a Real Time Passenger Information System at Auckland bus stops, exposing individuals to new timespaces while waiting for the bus.  The third considers students opinions of the e-learning mechanisms used in two first year geography courses.  The final intervention examines the role ICTs play in South Africans and South Koreans imagining, negotiation and mediation of the migration process to Auckland.  In conclusion, this thesis contributes to how geography constitutes knowledge about ICTs at three different levels.  Empirically, the four interventions contribute grounded findings to the debates in the geographic literature over interactions with ICTs.  Methodologically, the conditions of possibility institutional and individual actors are beginning to perceive through their encounters with ICTs are revealed as are the timespaces that may eventuate from these. Theoretically, to understand how the interactions between individuals and ICTs are performed this thesis demonstrates the need to interrogate the in between as a process, not just a gap or blank.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">information and communications technologies</field><field name="subject">time</field><field name="subject">space</field><field name="subject">geography</field><field name="subject">non representational theory</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3456</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automated techniques for formal verification of SoCs</field><field name="creator">Sinha, Roopak</field><field name="description">System-on-a-chip (SoC) designs have gained immense popularity as they provide designers with the ability of integrating all components (called IPs) of an application-specific computer system onto a single chip. However, one of the main bottlenecks of the SoC design cycle is the validation of complex designs. As system size grows, validation time increases beyond manageable limits. It is desirable that design inconsistences are found and fixed early in the design process, as validation overheads are significantly higher after IPs are integrated. This thesis presents a range of techniques for the automatic verification and design of SoCs that aim to reduce post-integration validation costs. Firstly, local module checking algorithm, a practical implementation of module checking, is presented. This technique allows for the comprehensive verification of IPs such that they guarantee the satisfaction of critical specifications regardless of the SoC they are used in. Local module checking is shown to be able to validate IPs in much lesser time on average than global module checking, and can help in handling many important validation tasks much before the integration stage. Next, a number of protocol conversion techniques that assist in the composition of IPs with incompatible protocols is presented. The inconsistencies between IP protocols, called mismatches, are bridged by the automatic generation of some extra glue-logic, called a converter. Converters generated by the proposed techniques can handle control, datawidth and clock mismatches between multiple IPs in a unified manner. These approaches ensure that the integration of IPs is correct-by-construction, such that the final system is guaranteed to satisfy key specifications without the need for further validation. Finally, a technique for automatic IP reuse using forced simulation is presented, which involves automatically generating an adaptor that guides an IP such that it satisfies desired specifications. The proposed technique can generate adaptors in many cases where existing IP techniques fail. As it is guaranteed that reused IPs satisfy desired specifications, post-integration validation costs are significantly reduced. For each proposed technique, a comprehensive set of results is presented that highlights the significance of the solution. It is noted that the proposed approaches can help automate SoC design and achieve significant savings in post-integration validation costs.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4238</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crystallographic studies of interactions between ligands and DNA oligonucleotides</field><field name="creator">Pytel, Patrycja Dominika</field><field name="description">This thesis consists of two major chapters, each with its own introduction, experimental section and discussion. The TG4T/daunomycin and G4/daunomycin complexes described in Chapter One are two out of only five crystallographic quadruplex/ligand structures reported to date. In both structures daunomycin molecules stack onto a terminal G quartet preventing the G4 quadruplex from destacking and unwinding. The number of interacting ligand molecules depends on the quadruplex structure itself. The G4 quadruplex can accommodate four daunomycin molecules within one layer, while the TG4T tetraplex only accommodates three. In both structures daunosamine moieties form hydrogen bonds with the quadruplex but only daunosamine moieties from the TG4T/daunomycin structure make slight incursions into the quadruplex grooves.  Both structures are stabilised by &#960;-&#960; interactions, hydrogen bonds, Van der Waals contacts and electrostatic interactions. The daunomycin/TG4T complex is the first ever reported and the only structure where a ligand interacts directly with the quadruplex groove. Chapter Two describes nine crystal structures of Hoechst 33258 analogues with d(CGCAAATTTGCG)2 and d(CGCGAATTCGCG)2 oligonucleotides, and is divided into two sections. Section A includes seven structures with Halogenated Hoechst 33258 analogues that are potential agents in radiotherapy, phototherapy, radioimmunotherapy or photoimmunotherapy, and the structure of the precursor. In all of the examined complexes the ligand binds to the minor groove but not all halogen substituents refine to 100% occupancy.  The refined occupancies of the halogen atoms reveal that the degree of carbon-halogen cleavage is highest for ortho and lowest for para substitution. Among meta substituents pointing outside the minor groove, bromine atoms had a higher occupancy than the larger iodines. The position of the halogen atom in the minor groove is influenced by additional substituents on the phenyl ring. In most cases the bulky halogen atom is facing outside of the minor groove. Only in the 3-iodo-5-isopropylHoechst complex is iodine positioned towards the floor of the groove allowing the big isopropyl group to face outside. Section B describes the structure of a carborane-containing ligand (JW-B) bound to the minor groove of d(CGCAAATTTGCG)2. The analysis shows that is possible to position boron-rich moieties close to the cell nucleus, and JW-B may have potential in Boron Neutron Capture Therapy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Quadruplex</field><field name="subject">DNA</field><field name="subject">X-ray</field><field name="subject">Structure</field><field name="subject">Crystal</field><field name="subject">Daunomycin</field><field name="subject">Anti-cancer drug</field><field name="subject">Hoechst 33258</field><field name="subject">Phototherapy</field><field name="subject">Dehalogenation</field><field name="subject">Ligand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3431</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of pavement deterioration models on the state highway network of New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Henning, Theunis F.P.</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the results of developing road pavement deterioration models for the State Highway network in New Zealand pavement deterioration models are an integral part of pavement management systems, which are used to forecast long-term maintenance needs and funding requirements on a road network.  As part of this research, a Long-term Pavement Performance (LTPP) programme has been established on 63 sections of the State Highways.  These sections are representative of typical road sections and climatic conditions on New Zealand roads.  Data collection on these sections is undertaken on an annual basis and consists of high accuracy manual measurements.  These measurements include road roughness, rutting, visual defect identification and strength testing with a Falling Weight Deflectometer. Based on the LTPP data, new model formats for New Zealand conditions were developed including a crack initiation model and a three-stage rut progression model.  The rut progression model consists of three stages, initial densification, stable rut growth and a probabilistic model to predict accelerated rut progression.  The continuous probabilistic model developed predicts the initiation of pavement failure events such as crack initiation and accelerated rutting.  It has been found that this model type has a strong agreement with actual pavement behaviour as it recognises a distribution of failure on roads rather than failure occurring at an particular point in time, namely, a year.  The modelling of rut progression in the three stages including, initial densification, stable rut progression and accelerated rutting has resulted in a significant increased understanding of this defect, especially for thin flexible chip seal pavements.  It has been established that the in-service performance of these pavements is relatively predictable.  However, incorporating both the in-service performance and the failure of pavements into one model was unrealistic.  Therefore, by having the different stages of rutting, resulted into a more accurate forecasting of this defect. Although this research has covered the two priority pavement models including cracking and rutting prediction, it has established the model framework for other pavement models to be developed.  As more data become available, further work can be undertaken to refine the models and to extend the research into the performance of alternative construction materials.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pavement deterioration</field><field name="subject">pavement models</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shining new light on motoneurons: characterization of motoneuron dendritic spines using light microscopy and novel analytical methods</field><field name="creator">McMorland, Angus John Cathcart</field><field name="description">Dendritic spines are fundamental units of information processing within the nervous system, responsible for independent modulation of synaptic input to neurons. Filopodia, often morphologically indistinguishable from spines, are involved in formation of synapses during neuronal development. Despite the importance of these structures for neuronal function, no detailed study of their presence on motoneurons has yet been made. Here, the presence of spines on hypoglossal motoneurons (HMs) is described at three developmental stages: at P0&#8211;2 and P9&#8211;11, spines are present at an average density of ~0.1 spines/micron, but at P19 spine density becomes negligible. In P0&#8211;2 and P9&#8211;11, spines are nonuniformly distributed, occuring in clusters, and at lower density in the most proximal and distal regions to the soma than at intermediate regions. HM spines coincide with a decrease in cell input resistance, which reduces excitability during development. Thus one may speculate that these spines are involved in the formation of new synapses required to maintain adequate excitatory drive. A major difficulty for the study of spines is their small size, which complicates measurement using optical methods. Here, I present a novel method for reconstructing spine morphology using geometric models based on a priori knowledge of spine structure. Tests of the technique using simulated data indicate that it has a resolving capability of up to 40 nm (limited by noise). The technique has been used to measure dendritic spines on HMs, showing that these structures have necks as small as 0.22 micron. For purely passive modulation of synaptic strength, spine necks need to be &lt;~ 0.15 micron. These data suggest that if modulation of synaptic input occurs, biochemical and/or active electrical processes are needed. The methods developed in this Thesis, which have here been applied to HMs, are generally applicable to the study of spine morphology, and its effect on synaptic processing, in all classes of neurons.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">neuroscience</field><field name="subject">microscopy</field><field name="subject">dendritic spines</field><field name="subject">high resolution</field><field name="subject">two-photon</field><field name="subject">fluorescence</field><field name="subject">mice</field><field name="subject">motoneuron</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320700 Neurosciences::320702 Central nervous system</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320600 Medical Physiology::320602 Cell physiology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::249900 Other Physical Sciences::249903 Instruments and techniques</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4268</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Justice in context: judging battered women defendants: a New Zealand case study</field><field name="creator">Simmonds, Sally Charlotte.</field><field name="description">The purpose of the thesis is to analyse the practical limits and scope of the substantive concept and principles of justice in response to a growing philosophical scepticism about the relevance and substance of the virtue of justice in the modern world. This critical reflection on justice is set in an actual context of considerable controversy surrounding the commitment to justice and compelling claims about the failure of the &#8216;justice system&#8217; to fulfil those commitments. This context encompasses debates and decisions about justice for battered women defendants. The first part of the thesis develops an extended empirical case study of the New Zealand &#8216;justice system&#8217; centred on the 1994 trial of Gay Oakes who killed her abusive husband and was convicted of his murder. Using this legal case as a critical point of departure for reflection on New Zealand&#8217;s commitment to justice for battered women defendants and for women victims of domestic violence more broadly, the case study includes a detailed overview of the legal, political and cultural aspects of New Zealand&#8217;s changing commitment to justice for battered women, concentrating on the twenty-year period between 1987 and 2007. The study overall reveals the complexity of the justice challenge in this context and raises serious concerns about the ongoing failure to meet the demands of justice in spite of significant progress made. The second part of the thesis engages in analytical reflection on the key principles of justice conceptualised in western political philosophy and underpinning the institutionalised commitment to justice in New Zealand. Divided into three distinct principles of justice &#8211; the principle of equal treatment or formal justice, the principle of equal consent, and the principle of just deserts &#8211; the analysis in this part of the thesis endeavours to translate each principle of justice defined in abstraction, based on hypothetical and universal dilemmas, to apply in specific contexts of judging what justice demands for battered women defendants. Although serious complexities of &#8216;translation&#8217; arise in each case, the analysis points to the conclusion that the sceptics are wrong to doubt the substance and relevance of justice, and that justice remains an important legal, political and moral virtue capable of guiding judgments in complex contexts.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3429</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bonding of additives to functional polyolefins by reactive blending</field><field name="creator">Roberts, Ann Jennifer</field><field name="description">This study examined the concept of using a reactive blending process to develop new polymeric additive systems. The objective was to investigate the potential of using a reactive processing technique as a means to bond additives to functional polymers, to create &#8220;in situ&#8221; bonds between functional groups present on the polymers and those present on the additives. The work is reported in two parts; the first part studied the bonding of colorants to functional polyolefins and the second part investigated the bonding of UV stabilisers to functional polyolefins. The research was completed with the long term objective that the approach should offer alternative additives to conventional non-bonded systems for use in polypropylene. An ethylene ionomer was utilised for the bonding of dyes, this was chosen for its optical clarity and chemical functionality. Polyethylene methacrylic acid (EMAA) ionomers and methine dyes were blended in the melt phase using an internal mixer to produce bright intrinsically colored polymers. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) in transmission mode was used to assess the bonding of the dye to the ionomer. Bonding resulted through electrostatic interactions between carboxylate groups on the ionomer and cations on the dye molecules. The reactive blending process also resulted in a change in the chromophoric structure of the dye. The bonded system was compared to a system whereby no bonding between the methine dye and polymer was expected. In the later system the methine dye was blended with polyethylene using an internal mixer. From FTIR results no interaction was observed between the dye and polyethylene in this system. This was supported by microscopic analysis that showed that the dye was present in the polyethylene as a dispersion. The second stage of research focussed on the UV stabilisation of polyolefins. A melt reaction was explored between polypropylene functionalised with maleic anhydride (PP-g-MA) and an alkoxyamine hindered amine light stabiliser (NOR-HALS) with hydroxyl functionality. The technology proposed is based upon the reaction between the carboxylic acid groups of maleated polypropylene and hydroxyl groups of a specific NOR-HALS (Tinuvin 152). The efficiency of the modification was assessed using FTIR to verify the esterification reaction between the NOR-HALS and the maleated polypropylene. This reaction resulted in the grafting of a pendant UV stabiliser to the polypropylene through an ester linkage. A twin-screw extruder (TSE) was used to complete this study. A larger quantity of material could be produced using a TSE compared to the colorant system where an internal mixer was used. Samples of the reactively blended materials were exposed to UV radiation for a maximum time period of three hundred hours to assess the resulting stability of the materials. Diffuse reflectance FTIR (DRIFT) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) provided an effective means to study oxidative degradation. IR spectroscopic measurements were used to determine the effectiveness of HALS in inhibiting the photo-oxidation of maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene. The inhibition was quantified by measuring the formation of carbonyl groups, with and without HALS bonded to the polymer, at fixed exposure times of UV radiation. DRIFT and XPS analysis confirmed that stabilised samples oxidised less, as indicated by the lower carbonyl index values and O1s / C1s ratios. These findings were complemented by results from Charpy impact tests. The mechanical property results indicated that the longevity of the materials with UV stabilisers grafted to them exceeded the PPg- MA system where there was no stabiliser present. Visible spectrophotometry was used to assess the colour of the polymeric samples and change in colour following exposure to UV radiation. Samples with bonded HALS demonstrated greater colour stability than control samples. The microstructure of the polymer surfaces was viewed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The polymeric samples demonstrated resistance to crazing when the NOR-HALS were bonded to the polymer. For both the colorant and UV stabiliser areas of research, thermal properties of the materials were assessed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). It was found that increasing the additive concentration in the polymer resulted in an increase in the temperature of crystallisation (Tc). Melt flow index can indicate if any change in molar mass had occurred during processing. An increase in melt flow index values (MFI) was observed when additive loading increased which suggested that degradation of the polymer had occurred during processing. In summary, reactive processing showed considerable promise as a means to bond additives to a functional polypropylene.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reactive blending</field><field name="subject">polyolefin</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3437</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stable isotope analysis of prehistoric human and commensal diet on Aitutaki, southern Cook Islands</field><field name="creator">Craig, Jacqueline Anne</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the prehistoric diet of humans and two of their key commensals on Aitutaki using stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes.  This technique gives us new insight into the diet of these three groups and results are considered in the context of the development of agricultural systems on Aitutaki, as well as in light of the wider context of cultural developments and environmental change in the Cook Islands and Polynesia as a whole.  Ultimately, it allows us to more fully understand the complex interactions between humans and the two largest commensals in order to evaluate the utility of these animals as proxies for humans in dietary analyses. The results indicate that the prehistoric human diet on Aitutaki can be characterised as mixed, dominated by terrestrial plants and marine protein with lesser amounts of terrestrial protein.  While the amount of protein eaten by the individuals was very similar, they varied in how much marine or terrestrial protein they ate.  The pigs had a slightly more terrestrial diet, with a greater emphasis on plant foods.  Their protein intake was more variable and terrestrial in nature than the humans&#8217;.  Dogs had a higher trophic level, more marine-oriented, diet than either humans or pigs. Like the humans, their diet contained more variation in the source of their protein.  Overall, however, the diets of all three groups were very similar. While the overall nature of the human, pig and dog diets, and their relationships to one another, remained relatively constant over time, beginning in the 14th century they show a decline in the amount of fish consumed and had a more terrestrial diet overall.  This confirms trends seen in the archaeofaunal assemblages, and throws light on the relationship between environmental change and human subsistence practices in East Polynesia. The similarity of the pig and dog diets to human diet, and the fact that the relationship remained constant over time, demonstrates the usefulness of the Aitutaki commensal animals as proxies for humans in stable isotope analysis. However, the specifics of that relationship vary by species and by place.  While the individual dietary variability provides us with new ways of looking at dietary change within populations, it also demonstrates the importance of obtaining as large an assemblage for analysis as possible in order to ensure that samples are representative of the population as a whole.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stable isotopes</field><field name="subject">carbon</field><field name="subject">nitrogen</field><field name="subject">palaeodiet</field><field name="subject">human</field><field name="subject">pig</field><field name="subject">dog</field><field name="subject">Polynesia</field><field name="subject">Cook Islands</field><field name="subject">Aitutaki</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3441</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand's National Archives: an analysis of machinery of government reform and resistance, 1994-1999.</field><field name="creator">Molineaux, Julienne</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses the impact of the1990s new public management reforms in New Zealand on one particular agency, the National Archives. It explores the unique combination of features that enabled this small low-profile agency and its stakeholders to stymie some of the machinery of government reforms that were proposed. This thesis is a qualitative study that draws on material from primary and secondary sources, with a heavy reliance on official documents. It chronicles the lack of value placed on the archives&#8217; administrative, constitutional and heritage functions by successive politicians and senior public servants. The thesis compares the values of the reformers, who had interests that were not specific to the Archives, and the values of the archiving professionals and their stakeholders, whose perspective was agency and policy-specific. The main reform time periods are 1994-2001, and 2005. While the clash between the two sets of values during this time is analysed chronologically, the thesis provides historical background prior to the reform period. The perspectives of various actors are told in their own words, where possible. This study illustrates the tensions between the need to co-ordinate the wider public sector with the peculiarities of a specific policy area. It also demonstrates the tensions between the highly theoretical and ideological nature of the public sector management reforms in New Zealand from the mid-1980s, and the values of one group of professionals that were not compatible with these reforms. While the policies of the reformers evolved over time, the values of the archivists were more static. These static values contributed to consistency in their preferred model of organisational design and placement within the public sector. Ironically the outdated legislation archivists complained about for decades and low political priority the policy area received, bestowed crucial protection against public sector management reforms that were contrary to international archival trends. Following a change in political leadership, the stable of professional values of the archive were adopted, removing archives from the policy change agenda.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3869</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creative girls: fashion design education and governmentality</field><field name="creator">Bill, Amanda Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with creativity as an object of educational governance and a category of subjective identification. It studies a &#8216;creativity explosion&#8217; in higher education in New Zealand, focusing on how fashion design students are being mobilized as subjects of creativity through &#8216;joined up&#8217; modes of governance and technologies of educational choice. Using a poststructural ethnographic &#8216;methodology&#8217; I explain how, from the late 1990s, models of educational governance began to appear dysfunctional and unable to deliver the attributes and capacities expected of citizens in a knowledge economy. I argue that creativity gained significance as a result of new ways of &#8216;thinking culture and economy together&#8217;. Neoliberal rhetorics representing creativity as flexible human capital and a generic, transferable skill needed by workers in the new economy, were articulated with liberal humanist notions about creativity, which are commonly understood and performed through the social categories of art. All kinds of individual and institutional actors took advantage of these shifting opportunity structures to position themselves with &#8216;creative&#8217; identities. Within various cultural organisations, including universities, moves to strengthen a liberal agenda and retain creativity as a form of &#8216;arts knowledge&#8217; with high cultural capital, rubbed up against counter-hegemonic strategies to enlist and develop more universal concepts about creativity as a collaborative endeavour, vital to new forms of capitalist enterprise. By historicising the context in which a new &#8216;normative doctrine&#8217; of creativity has emerged, and by treating its theorisation as culturally performative, I develop the position that fashion design graduates, as &#8216;creative girls&#8217;, are highly productive performers in the new categories of cultural economy. However I argue that the creative girl occupies a subject position fitted to after-neoliberalised social and economic arrangements, not because she is shaped by neoliberal ideologies, but because she is made up by techniques and tactics of an &#8216;after-neoliberal&#8217; governmentality. This demonstrates the mutual constitution of &#8216;creative economy&#8217; and &#8216;creative persons&#8217; and underlines the fact that despite after-neoliberal ambitions for managing education, there can be no simple cause and effect relation between higher education and economic performance.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">creativity research</field><field name="subject">creativity pedagogy</field><field name="subject">creative economy</field><field name="subject">sociology of design</field><field name="subject">gender studies</field><field name="subject">youth studies</field><field name="subject">governmental politics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4234</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microarray-based gene set analysis in cancer studies</field><field name="creator">Song, Qin Sarah</field><field name="description">This work addresses the development and application of gene set analysis methods to problems in microarray-based data sets.

Geothermal systems are a potential source of Sb in the fresh waters of New Zealand&#8217;s North Island, but little is known about the element&#8217;s behaviour within geothermal fluids, and even less about the eventual fate of geothermally produced Sb.  The purpose of this thesis was to determine the factors controlling geothermal Sb behaviour in a range of environments, in order to begin to develop an understanding of the eventual fate of Sb produced from geothermal systems. Factors controlling Sb precipitation at two New Zealand geothermal power stations, were determined using field measurements and geochemical model predictions.  Approximately 75 % of the incoming Sb, which ranged from 960 &#8211; 1650 &#956;g/kg in the incoming fluids was removed from solution within the Ngawha and Rotokawa power stations.  It was found that changes in pH and temperature were the most important factors controlling stibnite (Sb2S3) precipitation.  Thermodynamic databases could be used to model this precipitation process, once updated with recent published Sb2S3 solubility data. The mobility of Sb from Sb2S3 precipitates in geothermal features at Wai-O-Tapu and Waimangu, two New Zealand geothermal fields, were investigated.  At Wai-O-Tapu, daytime variations in aqueous Sb concentrations from the discharge of Champagne Pool may be due to to changing sulfide-sulfate equilibria coupled with photosynthetic bacterial processes.  While daytime concentrations of Sb approached 200 &#956;g/kg, most of the Sb remobilised by such mechanisms appears to be removed by adsorption onto suspended particulate material (SPM) or reprecipitation (as Sb2S3) in an anoxic, low pH lake feature downstream. Concentrations of Sb in the discharge from Alum Lake were below the analytical detection limit (&lt;0.2 &#956;g/kg).  At Waimangu, these daytime fluctuations were not observed in the discharge of Frying Pan Lake, and concentrations of Sb were ~13 &#956;g/kg.  In the absence of any downstream acidic waters, no precipitation was observed and only minor adsorption onto SPM was observed.  Most of the Sb produced from Frying Pan Lake is therefore transported into Lake Rotomahana, the system&#8217;s receiving environment. Natural Sb removal processes in receiving (non-geothermal) environments were also assessed.  In the Waikato River, Sb concentrations were low (~1 &#956;g/kg), compared to those observed in geothermal environments studied.  The most important process was adsorption to SPM, which is enhanced at low (&lt; 5) pH conditions, or in the anoxic base of stratified lakes.  In Lake Ohakuri, which was stratified during the summer of 2007, there was also the potential for the removal of Sb as Sb2S3 in the presence of sulfide species that form in the anoxic layer.  There was evidence that the adsorption of Sb changes with changing Fe concentrations in suspended particulate material, and therefore Sb adsorption was higher in winter than in summer.  The behaviour of Sb was conservative in the Port Waikato estuary at the mouth of the river. Throughout the research, Sb was compared to arsenic (As), a metalloid previously thought to exhibit behaviour similar to Sb in aquatic environments.  It was found that while any removal processes shown to affect Sb will also affect As, the inverse did not necessarily apply.  Arsenic will adsorb more readily to SPM than Sb and, while there was evidence for bioaccumulation of As by geothermal algae and freshwater macrophytes, there was no such evidence for Sb.  Therefore, if geothermally-derived Sb and As did ever significantly contaminate a downstream environment, it should not be assumed that the processes mitigating As contamination will necessarily also apply to Sb.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">antimony</field><field name="subject">geothermal</field><field name="subject">environmental chemistry</field><field name="subject">arsenic</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260300 Geochemistry</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4230</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Writing the prostitute: representations of prostitution in Victorian Britain</field><field name="creator">Attwood, Nina Jean</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies::430109 History: British</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3407</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The evolution of coopeation: insights from experimental populations of Pseudomonas fluorescens</field><field name="creator">Meintjes, Peter L.</field><field name="description">The field of experimental evolution is burgeoning under the power of microbial systems. Our ability to manipulate experimental design for use with microbes is only limited by our imagination. This thesis is a study that uses Pseudomonas fluorescens, a soil dwelling bacterium, as an experimental tool for understanding evolutionary processes. The evolution of cooperation has been a thorny issue for many years, because it initially seems to contradict the intrinsically selfish concepts established in Darwin&#8217;s theory of evolution by natural selection. Advances in microbiology and the ability to test important evolutionary theories using microbes, provides an exciting opportunity for those working in the field of experimental evolution. This thesis uses P. fluorescens to investigate four aspects of the evolution of cooperative behaviour organised into four results chapters (Chapters 2-5). The first describes the genotypic and phenotypic diversity of 26 independently derived &#8216;wrinkly spreader&#8217; genotypes in order to analyse the genetic and phenotypic variation among morphotypes. Mutations were identified in 25 of the 26 wrinkly spreaders including a new locus mws and three new genes of known loci wspE, awsR and awsO. This new genetic information provided additional insight into the molecular causes of the wrinkly spreader phenotype. Multivariate analysis of the phenotypic traits revealed that wspF mutants were phenotypically distinct from other morphotypes at a level below the ecological niche. The second chapter extended existing studies on the evolution of wrinkly spreader genotypes within the well-known Haystack model for evolution in group-structured populations, by studying the population dynamics of cooperative genotypes with and without group structure, in a multi-level selection one framework. It was shown that the time spent in a haystack affects the fitness of cooperators, because the longer group-generation treatment conformed to the predictions of the Haystack model, while the shorter group-generation treatment did not. The third chapter was an investigation into how the fitness of the emergent group-level phenotype formed by cooperating wrinkly spreader cells was dependent on the density of wrinkly spreader cells. Contrary to prediction, no density dependence was observed when calculated in a multi-level selection one framework, but rather it was determined that the emergent fitness was dependent on time, implicating a role for a development-like process. The final results chapter of this thesis incorporated the hypothesised role for a development-like process into a novel theoretical model for the evolution of multicellularity in which fitness would be determined in a multi-level selection two framework. Novel apparatus and experimental design were developed to determine if it were possible to observe a response to a selective regime that selected simultaneously at the level of the individual cell and the level of the group of cells. A significant response was shown after only six group-generation cycles. In summary, this thesis exploits P. fluorescens as an experimental tool to gain insight into complex ecological and evolutionary phenomena such as cooperation, biofilm formation and the evolution of multicellularity, and provides insight into the molecular causes of the cooperation among wrinkly spreader genotypes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biology</field><field name="subject">Evolution</field><field name="subject">Experimental evolution</field><field name="subject">Molecular Biology</field><field name="subject">Microbiology</field><field name="subject">Genetics</field><field name="subject">Microbial ecology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4229</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interpreting references to the subject in philosophical writings</field><field name="creator">Nickless, David, M.A.</field><field name="description">In this thesis I will develop and test an interpretive framework for the Subject based on the understanding that an entity can be identified as a Subject if it is the necessary referent for an attribution.

It does not, therefore, purport to be an exhaustive study of the law of contempt in all its protean forms. Rather, its aims are to assess what the law is, and why, and to consider whether it aptly describes the values of the society it purports to protect. The law of contempt has suffered from an excess of dichotomies and classifications which nowhere guarantee its clarity. The most enduring classification is that which distinguishes between criminal and civil contempts, largely on the basis of whether the sanctions which follow are punitive or coercive. Three types of criminal contempt are discussed. Contempt in the face of the court concerns the jurisdiction to punish summarily contumelious behaviour in court. It is argued that, since the summary procedure permits the imposition of sanctions without the usual trial safeguards, the contempt power ought to be limited to the removal of the contemnor from the court. Any more extensive contempt power arguably infringes the freedoms protected by the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. The law of sub judice contempt seeks to strike a balance between the competing values of freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial. Judicial insistence on the existence of a real risk as a matter of practical reality before the actus reus of this form of contempt is met has effectively restrained criticisms of the rule. Nevertheless, since it can penalise non-negligent practices, it is suggested that sub judice contempt should be treated as a crime of strict liability. The third form of criminal contempt, scandalising a court or judge, is said to be necessary to ensure confidence in the administration of justice. However, there is little evidence that the public perception of the judiciary would suffer through debate over the abilities of its judges. This arm of contempt ought not to be perceived as a form of judicial protectionism. For that reason, and because it arguably infringes the Bill of Rights Act 1990, it is urged that contempt through scandalising a court or judge should be abolished. The law of civil contempt is dealt with through a discussion of breaches of injunctions and undertakings. Since the sanctions which follow may serve both punitive and coercive ends the distinction between this category and the other three is regarded as incomplete. It is contended, however, that there are many similarities between criminal and civil contempts which merit their treatment as a genus. Whenever punitive sanctions are imposed (whether for a criminal or civil contempt) normal trial safeguards ought to exist. On the other hand, if enforcement of a court order is sought, such protection is inappropriate. A procedural approach to the different types of sanctions ought to rid contempt law of perplexing categorisations which fail to address the essential characteristics of the contempt power.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement::390100 Law</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3439</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Finite element solution of an eikonal equation for excitation wavefront propagation in ventricular mycodium</field><field name="creator">Tomlinson, Karl Antony</field><field name="description">An efficient finite element method is developed to model the spreading of excitation in ventricular myocardium by treating the thin region of rapidly depolarizing tissue as a propagating wavefront. The model is used to investigate the excitation sequence in the full canine ventricular myocardium. The solution to an eikonal&#8211;curvature equation for excitation time is shown to satisfy a reaction&#8211;diffusion equation for the bidomain myocardial model at the wavefront, while the solution to an eikonal&#8211;diffusion equation approximately satisfies the reaction&#8211;diffusion equation in the vicinity of the wavefront. The features of these two eikonal equations are discussed. A Petrov&#8211;Galerkin finite element method with cubic Hermite elements is developed to solve the eikonal&#8211;diffusion equation. The oscillatory errors seen when using the Galerkin weighted residual method with high mesh P&#233;clet numbers are avoided by supplementing the Galerkin weights with C&#8304; continuous functions based on derivatives of the interpolation functions. The ratio of the Galerkin and supplementary weights is a function of the P&#233;clet number such that, for one-dimensional propagation, the error in the solution is within a small constant factor of the optimal error achievable in the trial space. An additional noinflow boundary term is developed to prevent spurious excitation initiating on the boundary. The need for discretization in time is avoided by using a continuation method to gradually introduce the non-linear term of the governing equation. A small amount of artificial diffusion is sometimes necessary. Simulations of excitation are performed using a model of the anisotropic canine ventricular myocardium with 23.55 degrees of freedom for the dependent variable, and results are compared with reported experimental observations. When it was assumed that Purkinje fibres influence propagation only on the endocardial surface, excitation of the entire myocardium was completed in 56 ms. Altering material parameters to represent penetration of the Purkinje fibres beneath the left endocardial surface reduced the completion time to 48 ms. Modelling the effects of the laminar structure of myocardium by reducing the propagation speed by 40% in the direction normal to the layers delayed completion of excitation by only 4%.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291500 Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3507</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flexible software process model</field><field name="creator">Kirk, Diana Caroline</field><field name="description">Many different kinds of process are used to develop software intensive products, but there is little agreement as to which processes give the best results under which circumstances. Practitioners and researchers believe that project outcomes would be improved if the development process was constructed according to project-specific factors. In order to achieve this goal, greater understanding of the factors that most affect outcomes is needed. To improve understanding, researchers build models of the process and carry out studies based on these models. However, current models contain many ambiguities and assumptions, and so it is not clear what the results of the studies mean. The statement of this thesis is that it is possible to create an abstraction of the software development process that will provide a mechanism for comparing software processes and software process models. The long term goal of the research is to provide planners with a means of tailoring the development process on a project by project basis, with the aim of reducing risk and improving outcomes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280300 Computer Software::280302 Software engineering</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280111 Conceptual modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4228</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemical and microbial transformations of some lanosterol derivatives</field><field name="creator">Bartley, John Peter</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1969</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4233</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Post-Lapita developments in the Reef-Santa Cruz Islands, southeast Solomon Islands</field><field name="creator">Doherty, Moira Winifrid</field><field name="description">The Pacific is a world of islands, so human migrations are necessarily part of the story of this world. It is somewhat surprising therefore to find that there are so many points of contention among archaeologists, linguists and biologists about the role that migrations have played in producing culture change in Pacific prehistory -just how many migrations are we talking about, on what scale, by whom, and when, and which discipline provides more reliable evidence? The specifics of the debate may be local, but the substantive issues have broader applicability. This thesis attempts to contribute to the debate by considering the archaeological evidence for a hypothesised migration during the post-Lapita period of people speaking non-Austronesian languages into the Main Reef and Santa Cruz Islands in the southeast Solomon Islands. It describes the theoretical and methodological difficulties in trying to assess whether cladistic or rhizotic processes best account for culture change. Previously unpublished archaeological material from two Main Reef Islands sites is presented, and is compared with the linguistic and human biological evidence pertinent to the case study. The narratives of cross-cultural encounters during the historic period are examined to investigate how such interactions produce change in cultural traditions, and to assess the archaeological visibility of these contacts. While the archaeological record testifies to cultural borrowings and lendings in the Reef-Santa Cruz case, the argument for either large-scale population intrusion or replacement is not well supported. The archaeological record appears to be in conflict with the prevailing interpretation of history reconstructed from historical linguistics and human genetics.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology::370301 Biological (physical) anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4240</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identifying the Classical Theologia Crucis and in this Light Karl Barth's Modern Theology of the Cross</field><field name="creator">Bradbury, Rosalene Clare</field><field name="description">This dissertation is presented in two parts.  It first identifies the shape and content of an ancient system of Christian thought predicated on the theology of the cross of Jesus Christ, and proposes the marks typifying its theologians.  Over against the ensuing hermeneutic it next finds the project of twentieth century Swiss theologian Karl Barth to exhibit many of the defining characteristics of this system, and Barth himself to be fairly deemed a modern theologian of the cross.  He crucially recovers, reshapes and reasserts the classical theologia crucis as a modern theological instrument, one answering enlightened theology&#8217;s self-glorifying accommodation to modernity with the living Word of the cross.  The crucicentric system itself is found to comprise two major theological dimensions, epistemological and soteriological.  Each of these comprises dialectically corresponding aspects connected with false and true creaturely glory.  The cruciform Word (or theology) speaking through this system likewise moves in two directions.  It declares negatively that any attempt by the creature to circumvent the cross so as to know about God directly, or to condition God's electing decision, is necessarily the attempt to know and act as God alone may know and act - an attempt therefore on the glory of God.  It declares positively that in the crucified Christ God formally discloses the knowledge of God, and determines the creature for God.  This knowledge and election are appropriated to the creature as, drawn into the cruciform environment, its attempt to glorify itself is negated and Christ's exalted humanity received in exchange.  Thence it is lifted to participate in Christ's mind and in his glory, a process guided by the Holy Spirit and completed eschatologically.  The database for this research includes selected primary materials in the Apostle Paul, Athanasius, a group of medieval mystical theologians, the reformer Martin Luther - particularly here his Heidelberg Disputation, and Karl Barth.  It also pays attention to the recent secondary literature peripherally or more concertedly connecting itself to the theology of the cross, of whatever period.  In this literature numerous suggestions for the content of the theology of the cross exist, a major methodological task in the current research being to bring these together systematically.  To the extent that the inner structure of the system carrying the cruciform Word has not previously been made explicit, and Barth's crucicentric status not finally determined, in moving towards these achievements this dissertation breaks fresh ground.  In the process a new test by which to decide the crucicentric status of any theological project is developed, and a further and crucicentric way of reading Barth proposed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">theology of the cross</field><field name="subject">theologia crucis</field><field name="subject">Kreuzestheologie</field><field name="subject">Paul, Apostle</field><field name="subject">Athanasius</field><field name="subject">Bernard of Clairvaux</field><field name="subject">Theologia Germanica</field><field name="subject">Johannes Tauler</field><field name="subject">Nicholas of Cusa</field><field name="subject">Meister Eckhart</field><field name="subject">Luther, Martin</field><field name="subject">Barth, Karl</field><field name="subject">Christology</field><field name="subject">epistemology</field><field name="subject">soteriology</field><field name="subject">eschatology</field><field name="subject">theology of glory</field><field name="subject">theologia gloriae</field><field name="subject">modernity</field><field name="subject">modernism</field><field name="subject">Schleiermacher, Friedrich</field><field name="subject">medieval mysticism</field><field name="subject">medieval mystics</field><field name="subject">Reformation</field><field name="subject">cross</field><field name="subject">crucifixion</field><field name="subject">Jesus Christ</field><field name="subject">Jesus</field><field name="subject">Christ</field><field name="subject">Calvin, John</field><field name="subject">Cappadocian Fathers</field><field name="subject">Antony the Great</field><field name="subject">wisdom</field><field name="subject">foolishness</field><field name="subject">Heidelberg Disputation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::440000 Philosophy and Religion</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4261</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative diversity at the major histocompatibility complex in two dolphin species</field><field name="creator">Heimeier, Dorothea</field><field name="description">This thesis presents investigations of diversity at three genes (class I, DQA and DQB) of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) in cetaceans. The MHC genes encode for proteins that are crucial for initiating an immune response by binding invading pathogens in vertebrates. It has been acknowledged that a high diversity at these genes results in the ability to recognise a wider range of pathogens, therefore functional diversity is important for the survival of a species. Furthermore this diversity has been created under the influence of selection, which can reveal interesting contrasts with neutral markers about the history of selection of populations and species. The diversity at two genes (DQA and DQB) in natural populations of two contrasting species of cetaceans has been investigated in more detail. The species selected included both sub-species of Hector&#8217;s dolphin, the Hector&#8217;s dolphin (Cephalorhynchus hectori hectori) and the Maui&#8217;s dolphin (Cephalorhynchus hectori maui), as well as the long-finned pilot whale (Globicephala melas). These species were chosen, because both Hector&#8217;s dolphin sub-species contrast with the pilot whale species in regards to their population size, abundance, population structure and life history. For example both sub-species of Hector&#8217;s dolphin have small population sizes and only inhabit coastal areas around New Zealand, whereas the pilot whale is an abundant, pelagic dolphin species. In Chapter 2 the expression of class II MHC genes (DQA and DQB) was demonstrated for the first time for a cetacean species, the Hector&#8217;s dolphin. Using available information from the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), I also designed primers to investigate class I MHC. Fragments of MHC genes were amplified from cDNA, which was derived from blood samples of two Hector&#8217;s dolphins. These dolphins were the subject of a temporary live capture, presenting a unique opportunity for blood collection. No evidence was found for duplication of both MHC class II loci, but cloning suggested a minimum of three copies of class I genes within the genomic DNA. However, the expression of all class I genes was uncertain, since only one allele could be isolated from cDNA. Functionality for all three genes (class I, DQA and DQB) was supported by the evidence for balancing selection having operated on these genes, indicated by a higher ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions. In Chapter 3, a combination of single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and direct sequencing was used to describe DQA and DQB diversity in the Hector&#8217;s and Maui&#8217;s dolphin. Genetic samples for the Hector&#8217;s dolphin were available from previously collected stranding and biopsy samples (n = 233), representing three populations from the South Coast of New Zealand and the sub-species on the West Coast of the North Island of New Zealand. For the Hector&#8217;s dolphin of the South Island, a surprisingly large number of alleles at both loci (DQA = 4, DQB = 6) were found, considering their small population size and compared to other cetacean populations with larger population sizes. The Maui&#8217;s dolphin has been classified as critically endangered with less than 100 dolphins, but showed a relatively high nucleotide diversity for DQB (&#61552; = 4.5%). This diversity was based on only three alleles that have been retained in the sub-species, representing the most divergent of all six alleles. All populations showed strong geographic differentiation at both loci (DQA: FST=0.252; DQB: FST=0.333), with the greatest differentiation between the South Island population and the North Island Maui&#8217;s dolphin. Comparison to mitochondrial and microsatellite diversity suggested influence of stochastic genetic drift, although the pressure of balancing selection acting on DQB over an evolutionary time period was also evident by a higher ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS=5.9) and by a pattern of trans-specific allele sharing within the family of Delphinidae. In Chapter 4 similar methods were used to describe DQA and DQB in pilot whales using genetic samples from the long-finned pilot whale that were available from five mass-strandings from around New Zealand (n = 237). A larger number of alleles than for the Hector&#8217;s dolphin were found at both loci (DQA= 8; DQB= 8), although their large population size and pelagic abundance raises the expectation of an even greater number of alleles. The overall differentiation between mass-strandings was low, but significant for both loci (DQA: FST =0.012, DQB: FST =0.014). The differentiation of all strandings was greatest for the Golden Bay mass-stranding at DQA, but deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at DQB suggested either sub-structure within mass-strandings (Wahlund effect) or the presence of null alleles. As for the Hector&#8217;s dolphin and other mammalian species, the influence of balancing selection acting on DQB over a long evolutionary time period was evident by a higher ratio non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS=9.3) and by a pattern of trans-specific allele sharing within the family of Delphinidae.  Overall, diversity is surprisingly similar between these two cetacean species despite different life history characteristic, but low compared to domesticated ungulate species, such as the cow. If low MHC diversity is a general feature of cetaceans, due to the marine environment as suggested previously or rather a side effect of short-term demographic forces remains speculative. A standardised nomenclature for the increasing number of MHC alleles from cetacean is proposed in this thesis to assist with future development of this research.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MHC</field><field name="subject">Maui's dolphin</field><field name="subject">Hector's dolphin</field><field name="subject">long-finned pilot whale</field><field name="subject">population genetics</field><field name="subject">expression of MHC genes</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4441</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Here &amp; now: intimacy, immediacy and authenticity in New Zealand's reality television</field><field name="creator">West, Amy</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT This thesis analyses a range of reality television programmes produced in New Zealand as part of a wider investigation into the affective strategies and discursive practices of the medium of television itself. The capacity of television, and more specifically reality television, to bring things close and render them present - spatially, temporally, socially and emotionally &#8211; is the thematic fulcrum of this study. Closeness is variously interpreted here as proximity (in terms of space, geography or social position), co-incidence (in terms of time) and intimacy (in terms of emotional affect). The present-ness of reality programming is both temporal (occurring now, in the present tense) and physical (occurring here, in this body, in this home, in this country). It is through this affect of present-ness that reality television most clearly engages with the domain of the real. Thus, this study also turns upon a consideration of the various significant ways in which reality television defines, pursues and manifests moments of realness on screen. The thesis is broken down into two parts, entitled Here and Now respectively, reflecting the double axis of spatial (incorporating social) and temporal present-ness. Within this bi-partite structure, six chapters focus in turn on a number of different discursive threads: Viscerality, Ordinariness, Community, Amateurism, Intimacy and Temporal Immediacy, producing a cumulative theoretical framework through which to address reality TV. In terms of methodology, this thesis pursues its exploration of reality television through close textual readings of selected programmes which have been produced for a New Zealand audience. Where appropriate, however, it draws on international examples of reality programming, in particular, those high-profile formats from Europe and the United States which have generated new paradigms for the production and reception of reality television worldwide. In addition, this thesis analyses programme form and content through a range of theoretical frameworks drawn from television studies and other academic disciplines. It also seeks to engage with international critical and academic debates surrounding the often controversial rise of reality programming as a televisual phenomenon in the nineties and into the twenty-first century. The production of this thesis coincides with a surge in academic output on the subject of reality television, and has benefited from recent publications in this area. This thesis attempts to balance both general and specific interests in New Zealand&#8217;s reality programming. On one hand, it places reality television within the context of long-established, international academic discussions about television as a medium, with the intent of showing that reality programming has an innate applicability to the domestic medium out of which it has arisen. On the other, this thesis pursues a more specific project, as it considers locally-produced programming as the particular output of the island nation of New Zealand. In this case, I argue that the particular aesthetic and discursive practices of reality programming, which devolve upon the ordinary, the domestic and the local, are well-suited to the ongoing production of culture and identity in a settler nation such as New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">television</field><field name="subject">reality</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410300 Cinema, Electronic Arts and Media Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4232</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecstatic display call of the Ad&#233;lie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)</field><field name="creator">Marks, Emma Josephine</field><field name="description">The ability to understand the complex mechanisms by which species communicate has been the focus of study for many years. The Ad&#233;lie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) breeds in vocally challenging Antarctic colonies and has evolved a complex system of intra- and intersexual visual and vocal behaviours. Unique to the Ad&#233;lie penguin, is the presence of two distinct display calls, the Loud Mutual Display (LMD) call and male Ecstatic Display Call (EDC). The EDC is used for both mate choice and territory defence; but apart from general structure and function this call remains basically unstudied. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the EDC with regard to its function (during mate choice) and variability over time, with location and with changing conditions. It is predicted that the EDC will be an individual call that is distinct from the LMD call. Additionally, the effects of an inclement breeding season on factors that affect breeding success will be examined using a logistic regression approach. The study took place over two breeding seasons(2000/1 &amp; 2002/3) on Ross Island, Antarctica, with the majority of research being conducted at Cape Bird. Results of the study indicate that the EDC is an individual call that cannot reliably be described as a male display as females also give an EDC that is acoustically comparable. The similarities between the EDC and the LMD call seem to relate only to syllabic organisation (structure), as almost every call parameter was different between call types. Furthermore, several call parameters differed between Ross Island colonies. These parameters varied with both geographical location and colony size. In conjunction with variation in call parameters, the health and breeding success of the colonies was different. The stability of call parameters (from Cape Bird) indicated that parameters that separate colonies not only alter between breeding years, but also vary during a single breeding season. The function of the EDC as an honest signal during mate choice was supported by spectral analyses. These analyses found heavier males had significantly lower Frequency Modulation (FM) in the short repeated syllables of their calls than lighter males. Furthermore, a male&#8217;s breeding success could be predicted during the early breeding season by the FM. Logistic regression models showed that early male arrival, weight and good nest quality were most influential in predicting fledging success. The logistic regression method also showed that the parameters measured varied in their predictive ability as the season progressed. This study has not only enhanced the wealth of knowledge regarding Ad&#233;lie breeding behaviour and developed our understanding of the vocal repertoire of this species, but also has implications for honest signalling theory, and the evolution and stability of vocal variation at different spatial and temporal scales.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adelie penguin</field><field name="subject">Ecstatic Display Call</field><field name="subject">mate choice</field><field name="subject">breeding success</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4241</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Species recognition in zebra finches: testing the effects of sex, sensory modalities, and social ontogeny</field><field name="creator">Campbell, Dana L.M.</field><field name="description">Species recognition is an integral component of mate selection and must occur in all sexually reproducing organisms to avoid costly hybridisation. Species recognition abilities may be comprised of both innate components and experience during ontogeny through the learning of visual, acoustic, and other sensory species-specific cues. But how greatly is the ability to recognise one&#8223;s own species (conspecifics) over others (heterospecifics) dependent on the phylogeographic relationship of the array of potential species as social partners and to what extent is the discriminatory behaviour modulated by subject ontogeny versus species identity? Using a model system, which is widely studied in all disciplines of avian research, the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata castanotis), I aimed to investigate the visual and acoustic cues involved in conspecific recognition by both female and male individuals of this species. I used an array of previously untested phylogeographically relevant estrildid heterospecifics as my stimuli and tested subjects of diverse experimental ontogenetic treatments. By scoring a wide-selection of measured behavioural responses my research indicates that female and male zebra finches prefer live conspecifics over live phylogeographically relevant heterospecific stimuli and this preference is more consistent by females than males. Female zebra finches rely on both visual and acoustic features of potential social partners for accurate species discrimination; in this regard video playbacks or the diverse colour morphs of domesticated zebra finches may be useful tools for further experimentation. Additionally, females display significant individuality in their behavioural responses which may be relevant for pair bonding decisions made by both sexes. I further documented that normally-reared zebra finches will prefer song playbacks of their own species but that both rearing in an indoor restricted acoustic environment of conspecifics or cross-fostering to another species will reduce discrimination preferences, although the results may depend on the behavioural metrics analysed.

In this research two complementary methods of damage estimation using either knowledge of the structure and earthquake or recorded structural responses were investigated. These methods gave different natured estimates, either prediction or detection, which are suitable for different applications. Firstly, damage to a structure was predicted based on analysis of structural and ground motion properties. Secondly, damage to a structure was detected and assessed by analysing the structural response under dynamic excitation. In the first approach, basic structural and ground motion properties were used to characterise a broad group of structures and earthquakes. These properties were used as inputs into a Back-Propagation (BP) Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and related to a damage index that quantified the extent of damage to the structure. A set of prior structural analyses was required to train the ANN before useful predictions could be made. Applied to 2D Reinforced Concrete (RC) frames, the method was capable of predicting with good accuracy damage to frames of varying stiffness, strength and topology whilst subjected to a range of ground motion severities. In the second approach, Autoregressive (AR) models were used to fit the acceleration time histories obtained when the structure was in both undamaged and damaged states. The AR coefficients were selected as damage sensitive features and statistical pattern recognition techniques were investigated for interpreting changes in the values of these features caused by damage. Initially, an offline damage detection method was developed in which BP ANNs were used for both classification and quantification tasks where the percentage remaining stiffness at a specific location was estimated. The method was applied to three experimental structures; a 3-storey bookshelf structure, the ASCE Phase II Experimental SHM Benchmark Structure and a RC column. In addition, for damage classification tasks only, the supervised classification techniques of Nearest Neighbour and Learning Vector Quantisation were found to be effective while Self-Organising Maps, an unsupervised classification method, showed promising results. Finally, an online damage detection method was developed based on recursive identification of the AR models using the forgetting factor and Kalman filter approaches. A linear 3-DOF model with time varying stiffness was investigated and the results showed that damage could be detected and quantified as it occurred. Nonlinear damage detection was addressed with the investigation of a 1-DOF bilinear oscillator and a 3- DOF Bouc-Wen hysteretic system. In both cases the on-set of nonlinearity was detected using Outlier analysis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering::290801 Structural engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4270</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Raman scattering and four-wave mixing: from fundamentals to fibre lasers</field><field name="creator">Schr&#246;der, Jochen, 1976-</field><field name="description">Ramanscattering and four-wave mixing are two fundamental nonlinear phenomena present in optical fibres with important implications for applications in fields ranging from modern telecommunications networks to biophotonics. This thesis investigates three situations when these two phenomena interact: Firstly we investigate the interplay of multiple four-wave mixing processes using coherent and incoherent pump waves in the presence of Raman scattering. We experimentally demonstrate that despite the requirements of phase-matching conditions it is possible to observe multiple phasematched and non-phasematched four-wave mixing processes. Furthermore we show that an incoherent light wave provided by amplified spontaneous emission noise can act as an effective pump wave for degenerate four-wave mixing. The main part of the thesis is occupied by the investigation of a mode-locked Raman fibre laser. The use of dissipative four-wave mixing for the passive mode-locking technique in combination with Raman scattering as the gain mechanism offers the possibility of achieving ultra-high repetition rates at very high average output powers. We experimentally demonstrate the mode-locked operation of the laser at 500 GHz and achieve an average output power of almost 1 W. Additionally we examine the key limitation of the laser which is supermode noise caused by mode-locking the laser at very high harmonics of the cavity resonance frequency. In order to gain qualitative insight into the influence of supermode noise on the laser dynamics we create a laser model which takes account of supermode noise. Furthermore we design a scheme to reduce supermode noise using additional subcavities, and evaluate the scheme using a lower repetition rate laser. We show that by including the subcavities into the setup the amount of supermode noise can be reduced by at least a factor 100. Lastly we introduce a novel method to measure the noise fluctuations of continuous wave lasers at timescales prohibiting the use of traditional noise measurement techniques. The noise is measured using a technique which transfers the fast noise from the continuous wave laser to a low repetition rate mode-locked laser which can be measured with traditional methods. We demonstrate that a continuous wave Raman fibre laser exhibits ultrafast, high contrast intensity fluctuations at timescales of tens of Gigahertz.

The goal of this thesis is to apply techniques in CTS and modelling for studying disease progression and the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of levodopa in Parkinson's disease. Three components of levodopa response can be identified in patients with Parkinson's disease; a transient short-duration response, a sustained long-duration response to exogenous levodopa, and diurnally varying endogenous levodopa synthesis. A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model was developed to describe the individual components of levodopa response. Twenty-one previously untreated (de novo) patients with Parkinson's disease and 12 patients who had received levodopa orally for 9.7 &#177; 4.0 years were investigated. Twenty de novo patients were examined at 6, 12, 24 and 48 months. No systematic changes in levodopa pharmacokinetics were found in the first 4 years of long-term levodopa treatment. A lowered baseline motor response and an increase in efficacy with time result in an exaggerated short-duration response which might be key contributors to the development of motor fluctuations with long-term levodopa treatment. The capability of CTS to generate typical responses was evaluated. If progression rate of bradykinesia is influenced by age then it should be possible to detect this effect using reasonable clinical trial designs. The ELLDOPA trial aims to determine if levodopa slows or accelerates the rate of disease progression of Parkinson's disease. The power of the ELLDOPA trial design was evaluated using a clinical pharmacology model. The simulation results suggested that the short washout period for levodopa symptomatic effect could lead to a false conclusion about the nature of the levodopa treatment effect. This thesis has shown that pharmacodynamic or disease progression factors rather than pharmacokinetic changes are responsible for the development of motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease. It has quantified the unexpected development of increased efficacy of levodopa over time. Clinical trials designed to evaluate disease progression without recognising washout of the long-duration response of levodopa can lead to misinterpretation of trial outcomes. However, model based approaches can disentangle these confounding factors and dissect the underlying effects of drug action on disease progression.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320500 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4266</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of an Online English learning program</field><field name="creator">Ho, Yi-Chieh</field><field name="description">Along with the rapid growth of computer technology, the need for CALL evaluation has become increasingly important; however, its implementation remains problematic for a number of reasons including teachers&#8217; lack of experience and adequate skills (Hubbard, 2006), lack of mutually agreed-upon adequate criteria (Hubbard, 2006), and lack of higher-level evaluative skills to evaluate media online (Oosterhof, Conrad, &amp; Ely, 2008). This study describes the classroom-based evaluation of a CALL program. It was undertaken in a Taiwan technological institute, with participants (N = 39) from second-year night-time junior college. The aims were to evaluate the effectiveness of the English Discoveries Online (EDO) program, to identify changes for more effective future use and sound criteria for CALL evaluation. The program&#8217;s key features include self-directed courses, self-access out of class, regularly updated materials delivered through the Internet, Web-literacy development, the Teacher Management System, and support tools. Effectiveness was determined by examining self-access learning out of class, motivation, Web-literacy, English proficiency, and the above key features. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used. The evaluation followed Alderson&#8217;s (1992) framework for planning, Weir and Roberts (1994) for design and implementation, and Ellis&#8217; (1997a &amp; b) three types of evaluation for data collection. Instruments included: questionnaires, checklists, an observation record of student behaviors, a monitoring record of the computer screens, reports, individual student records on self-access, and student e-mails sent to the teacher-researcher. The results showed that students considered the EDO helpful for learning English, for enhancing their computer knowledge and English learning interest out of class. There was no significant change in students&#8217; motivation and Web-literacy. There was a significant improvement in students&#8217; pre- and post-test scores in reading and writing. More positive rather than negative comments were given about the key features of the program in students&#8217; reports. Overall, 91% of the class considered the program effective. The findings indicate that this program has a place in English teaching in this Taiwan context. Implications and limitations, as well as lessons learned as a teacher and an evaluator, are discussed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4300</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neuronal changes in the cerebral cortex of human brain in Huntington&#8217;s Disease</field><field name="creator">Thu, Doris C. V.</field><field name="description">Huntington's disease (HD) is characterised by a major loss of neurons mainly in the basal ganglia but recent evidence by Macdonald and Halliday (2002) and others have shown that the cerebral cortex is also affected. In this study, neuronal changes in the primary motor cortex (Brodmann's area 4), primary sensory cortex (Brodmann's area 3), anterior cingulate cortex (Brodmann's area 24) and superior frontal cortex (Brodmann's area 8) were investigated in 16 HD cases and 15 age, sex and postmortem-delay matched normal cases. Immunohistochemical techniques and light microscopy were used to compare the pattern of neuronal loss between the normal and HD cortices. The total neuronal population (NeuN) and pyramidal subpopulation (SMI32) in a subvolume of specific Brodmann's areas were investigated using unbiased stereological counting techniques. The results demonstrated a marked neuronal reduction in these cortical regions in HD compared to normal cases, and this reduction was greater as the "striatal" neuropathological grade increased in the primary motor and primary sensory cortex. However, in the anterior cingulate and superior frontal cortex, marked reduction was also demonstrated in the early grade cases. Despite this, there is also a large variation in the pattern of cell loss between HD cases of the same neuropathological grade, prompting the hypothesis that other factors may be influencing the extent of cell degeneration. To investigate this, the HD cases in this study were grouped into "mainly motor", "mainly mood" and "mixed" symptomatology groups. The results have shown that regardless of their striatal neuropathological grade, the pattern of cell loss in the cerebral cortex is correlated to the various clinical symptomatologies of HD. Another major finding is the demonstration of marked dystrophic changes in the remaining pyramidal neurons in HD cortex, suggesting major ongoing neuronal dysfunction. In addition, cortical interneurons (calbindin, calretinin and parvalbumin) are also shown to be affected in HD. These overall findings, together with the demonstration that there is no statistically significant correlation between the extent of neuronal cell death in the cortex and the CAG expansion number in the HD IT15 gene, show that HD is a heterogeneous disease where the pattern of cell loss in the cerebral cortex is as variable as the pattern of symptomatology. These findings provide a major contribution to the scientific understanding of the pathogenesis of HD in the human brain.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4265</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Therapeutic potential of neural progenitor cell transplantation in a rat model of Huntington&#8217;s Disease</field><field name="creator">Vazey, Elena Maria</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neural progenitor cells</field><field name="subject">Cell transplantation</field><field name="subject">Huntington's disease</field><field name="subject">Lithium chloride</field><field name="subject">hESC</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4484</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantitative continuity feature for preterm neonatal EEG signal analysis</field><field name="creator">Wong, Lisa, 1968-</field><field name="description">Electroencephalography (EEG) is an electrical signal recorded from a person's scalp, and is used to monitor the neurological state of the patient. This thesis proposes a quantified continuity feature to aid preterm neonatal EEG analysis. The continuity of EEG signals for preterm infants refers to the variation of the EEG amplitude, and is affected by the conceptional age of the infants. Currently, the continuity of the signal is determined largely by visual examination of the raw EEG signal, or by using general guidelines on amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG), which is a compressed plot of the estimated signal envelope. The proposed parametric feature embodies the statistical distribution parameters of the signal amplitudes. The signal is first segmented into pseudo-stationary segments using Generalized Likelihood Ratio (GLR). These segments are used to construct a vector of amplitude, the distribution of which can be modelled using a log-normal distribution. The mean and standard deviation of the log-normal distribution are used as the continuity feature. This feature is less prone to the effects of local transient activities than the aEEG. This investigation has demonstrated that the degree of continuity corresponds to the major axis of the feature distribution in the feature space, and the minor axis roughly corresponds to the age of the infants in healthy files. Principal component analysis was performed on the feature, with the first coefficient used as a continuity index and the second coefficient as a maturation index. In this research, classifiers were developed to use the continuity feature to produce a qualitative continuity label. It was found that using a linear discriminant analysis based classifier, labelled data can be used as training data to produce labels consistent across all recordings. It was also found that unsupervised classifiers can assist in identifying the intrinsic clusters occurring in the recordings.  It was concluded that the proposed continuity feature can be used to aid further research in neonatal EEG analysis. Further work should focus on using the continuity information to provide a context for further feature extraction and analysis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Signal Processing</field><field name="subject">EEG</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291600 Computer Software</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4532</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women writing trauma : an analysis of psychological trauma in Ingeborg Bachmann's Das Buch Franza, Christa Wolf's Kassandra, Patricia Grace's Cousins, and Ngahuia Te Awekotuku's Ruahine - mythic women</field><field name="creator">Allport, Tanya</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to explore how women express psychological trauma through the writing of fiction. By analysing the historical context of what psychological trauma has meant to women, and how they have represented it, the thesis proposes a model which is based on the recurrent sources of trauma for women, the &#8216;triple trauma&#8217; of othering, violence, and voicelessness. By using cross-cultural examples from the writing of Austrian Ingeborg Bachmann, German writer Christa Wolf, and the New Zealand M&#257;ori writers Patricia Grace and Ngahuia Te Awekotuku, questions are asked about the similarities and differences of how psychological trauma is represented through fiction, and what this means for the female protagonists of the texts, the female writers, readers and the cultures and societies out of which these writings originate. In analysing these relations, this thesis finds that the fictional writing about the sources and experiences of trauma can expose a range of ideological connections, and that the writing and reading about these connections constitutes a valid trauma discourse. This trauma discourse supports the aim of contemporary feminist traumatology which is to make women&#8217;s trauma visible, give meaning to it, and ultimately create frameworks that promote the healing (and prevention) of trauma.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4527</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Degradation mechanisms and development of silicon carbide refractories</field><field name="creator">Etzion, Ron</field><field name="description">The lifetime of aluminium reduction cells is of considerable importance in the operating economics of an aluminium smelter. Not only are the cell materials costly, but cell life is also key in minimizing production downtime and the waste material generated in the cutting-out and relining of a reduction cell.  This lifetime is increasingly driven by two components of the cell lining: the carbon cathode and the sidewall refractories which are the primary containment of the metal and electrolyte.  Silicon nitride bonded silicon carbide (SNBSC) refractories are the current state-of-the-art sidewall materials. These materials are formed by encapsulation of SiC particles in a silicon nitride matrix, by nitridation of silicon at high temperatures under a nitrogen atmosphere.  In this study the mechanisms of the corrosion of silicon nitride bonded silicon carbide refractories in an aluminium reduction cell environment were examined.  Microstructural analysis of SNBSC materials by: X-ray diffraction, solid state NMR, Raman spectroscopy, XPS, and SEM, identified variations in &#945;/&#946; Si3N4 ratio and porosity in the binder phase, with higher porosity levels and &#946; Si3N4 content found in the interior part of the brick. Unreacted metallic silicon was observed only as a crystalline phase inside SiC grains and is not associated with the binder phase.  SNBSC samples from eight different commercial refractory manufacturers were tested in an industrial aluminium cell environment, both by immersion in industrial cells and in the laboratory.  The samples showed extensive attack and considerable differentiation between the samples.  The effects on the corrosion rate of porosity levels, amount of binder, &#945;/&#946; Si3N4 ratio, free Si content in the binder, and different factors in the environment were examined in the laboratory scale trials. A laboratory scale testing rig with some novel features, such as a rotating anode, was developed to examine corrosion resistance of samples under electrolysis conditions in molten cryolite at up to 1000oC.  Corrosion test results, supported by thermodynamic calculations, identified the Si3N4 binder as the reactive phase in SNBSC materials, especially in the gas phase above the bath level. High porosity levels and high &#946; Si3N4 fraction in the binder showed a statistically significant contribution to the corrosion rate in lab-scale corrosion trials. Commercial materials are also highly inhomogeneous in the distribution of the &#946; Si3N4 phase as mentioned above, which complicates sample selection and the interpretation of corrosion test results.   The crystal morphology of &#946; Si3N4 is suggested as the reason for the high reactivity of these materials. This morphology characterised by elongated rod-like shape crystals with hexagonal cross section, presents a higher surface area compared to &#945; Si3N4 crystals containing mainly flat matte crystals. In the light of this observation, the binder phase in selected samples was deliberately modified to convert a significant fraction of the &#945; Si3N4 to &#946; Si3N4. Corrosion rates measured from these modified samples in general support the argument that the crystallographic form of silicon nitride contributes to corrosion rate. The proposed corrosion mechanism for SNBSC materials in the aluminium reduction cell atmosphere is based on combination of oxidation of the binder followed by attack of corrosive gases to produce volatile SiF4.  Thus the binder phase is initially passivated below the electrolyte level on the sidewall, where exposure to corrosive gases is limited, but occurs more rapidly in the area above the electrolyte/air interface.  The intrusion of electrolyte into the refractory and capillary transport up the sidewall is a key in accelerating this reaction.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aluminium</field><field name="subject">SiC refractories, Corrosion</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4531</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Similariton compression in a comb-like dispersion decreasing fibre</field><field name="creator">Im, Sung-Hoon</field><field name="description">Optical pulse compression using similariton propagation in an optical fibre with decreasing dispersion has been demonstrated for the first time. This compression scheme is a practical application of the sech-similariton solution to the generalized nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLSE) with distributed coefficients recently found using the self-similarity technique. The sech-similariton solution exhibits a characteristic positive linear frequency chirp, which increases in slope as the pulse compresses. The solution does not develop any side pedestals or deformation in pulse shape as it propagates, making it a promising candidate for a new compression technique. Unlike the adiabatic compression technique, rapid compression can be achieved in a fibre with a specifically designed decreasing group velocity dispersion profile since the sech-similariton is an exact solution to the NLSE. A cost-effective and efficient method of realising decreasing dispersion in a fibre has been developed using a comb-like dispersion profiling technique and its feasibility has been experimentally demonstrated. An optimised experimental similariton compressor system has been built using two industry standard fibres which compressed an 11 ps linearly chirped sech input pulse to 400 fs, yielding a compression factor of greater than 25.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240500 Classical Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4524</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A methodology for business processes identification: developing instruments for an effective enterprise system project</field><field name="creator">Berkowitz, Zeev</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4346</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Te Mana o Te Waimana Tuhoe history of the Tauranga valley</field><field name="creator">Sissons, Jeffrey</field><field name="description">This study is an interpretation of history related by T&#363;hoe historians of the Tauranga valley, a valley situated on the northern side of the Urewera ranges, North Island, New Zealand. It is also an interpretation of historical records relating to the Tauranga valley T&#363;hoe community. Fieldwork for the study was carried out between November 1977 and July 1978, and between November 1978 and May 1979. It is argued that T&#363;hoe history of the Tauranga valley comprises four separate, but connected, domains of discourse. The first domain considered includes narratives which link tribes and sub-tribes, and relate them to their land. The second concerns relationships between local wh&#257;nau, extended families descended from grand-parents of elders now living. Accounts which comprise the third domain focus upon the identity of Rua Kenana, a T&#363;hoe leader who, with his people the Iharaira (or Israelites), established a &#8216;city of God&#8217; at Maungap&#333;hatu (at the source of the Tauranga river). The fourth domain is that of reminiscence. Three Tauranga valley settlements are described by four Iharaira elders; Tataiahape between 1909 and 1915, Matah&#299; between 1915 and 1927, and T&#257;whana in the late 1920s and 1930s. In order to highlight and explore distinctions between T&#363;hoe history and Western history, T&#363;hoe accounts are not integrated with documentary sources into a single narrative. The focus is upon T&#363;hoe history and documents are drawn upon where relevant to an understanding of this history as a distinctive mode of discourse.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4419</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A design framework and genetic algorithm for digital design optimisation on FPGAs</field><field name="creator">Savage, Matthew James Waipurukuma.</field><field name="description">Design tools of ever increasing power are required to keep pace with technological improvements in chip production. Chip capacities continually increase meaning that designs previously unfeasible become feasible. These designs are typically more complex and larger than their predecessors. Usually, the time available to a designer does not increase at the same rate. A designer is therefore tasked with a greater work load and a very limited amount of time. Design tools and automation are therefore necessary to compensate for this situation. The limiting characteristics of a design tool are its ease of use, the range of systems it can be applied to, and the quality of results obtained. Should a design tool lack in any of these three areas it will be of limited benefit. This work addresses only the quality of results obtained. While the other two are essential, they are unlikely to be relevant to a design tool if that tool is not adopted because the results were of insufficient quality. A design framework is proposed for the digital design of systems on FPGAs. This framework sets out the processes for producing a system specification of the design problem encountered, and then gives a procedure for processing that specification to produce a set of pareto-optimal designs in VHDL to implement the specification. The actual mapping of a specification to a VHDL design, is held in a mapping string that allows optimisation to be separated from other stages in the design framework. A new genetic algorithm, the Adaptive Speciation Genetic Algorithm (ASGA), is proposed featuring a customised selection, crossover, and mutation operator. This algorithm is assessed against other genetic algorithms from the literature on a knapsack problem and three digital design case studies. These case studies were the design of a parameter estimation circuit for a Self-Tuning Regulator (STR), the design of a Sum-of-Absolute- Difference (SAD) function for video motion detection problems, and the design of a five state Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Results indicated that ASGA had good performance in all these problems. Through tests against other genetic algorithms, it was found the ASGA&#8217;s selection operator was inferior in some cases to that of the Pareto Envelope Selection Algorithm (PESA) by 3 Corne et al. By incorporating the selection operator of PESA performance improvements could be gained in the EKF problem.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">genetic algorithm</field><field name="subject">digital design</field><field name="subject">FPGA</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280212 Neural networks, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4523</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Involvement of the osteoblast in Paget's disease of bone</field><field name="creator">Matthews, Brya Grace</field><field name="description">Paget&#8217;s disease is characterised by focal regions of accelerated bone turnover. The aetiology is unknown, but genetic and environmental factors have been implicated. Pagetic lesions contain increased numbers of osteoclasts with abnormal morphology, so an osteoclast defect has been considered central to the pathogenesis. However, given osteoblasts regulate osteoclast differentiation and activity; osteoblast abnormalities may be important in the disease. This study aimed to identify features of pagetic osteoblasts that could clarify their role in Paget&#8217;s disease. Gene expression in osteoblasts and bone marrow cultured from pagetic lesions of 23 patients was compared to cells from unaffected tissue using both microarrays and real time RT-PCR. The results indicated global changes in gene expression in pagetic osteoblasts. A number of genes that can stimulate osteoclastogenesis, including interleukins 6 and 1&#946;, and monocyte chemotactic factor 1 were up-regulated, but the RANKL/OPG ratio tended to be decreased. Genes involved in osteoblast differentiation were down-regulated, including the transcription factors RUNX2, DLX5 and SATB2, the osteogenic factor BMP2, and the matrix proteins osteocalcin and bone sialoprotein. Markers of less mature osteoblastic cells, alkaline phosphatase and matrix gla protein were up-regulated. The intermediate filament, keratin 18, was very significantly up-regulated in pagetic cells. Over-expression of this protein in osteoblasts using an adenoviral vector produced some changes in gene expression, but did not produce an overtly pagetic phenotype. Over-expression of SQSTM1 mutants found in some patients with Paget&#8217;s disease also produced only minor changes in osteoblast phenotype. The RNA from the primary cell cultures was also used to investigate the presence of measles virus and somatic mutations in SQSTM1 in the disease, but neither were identified in any of the patients.  These results suggest that there are important changes in pagetic osteoblasts that are maintained when the cells are removed from the affected bone microenvironment. These include enhanced production of factors to stimulate osteoclastogenesis, while osteoblast differentiation and activity may be impaired. We were unable to identify genetic or environmental factors that could trigger these changes. The pagetic osteoblast is distinct from control cells, and is likely to contribute to the development of Paget&#8217;s disease.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Paget's disease</field><field name="subject">osteoblast</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4483</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding and measuring flow in aortic stenosis with MRI</field><field name="creator">O'Brien, Kieran Robert</field><field name="description">In patients with aortic stenosis, accurate assessment of severity with echocardiography is central to surgical decision making. But, when image quality is poor or equivocal results obtained, another robust non-invasive technique would be invaluable. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) may be a useful alternative. Phase contrast CMR can measure  ow and velocity, therefore it is theoretically possible to estimate the main determinant of severity aortic valve area, using the continuity approach. However, it was found that the phase contrast estimate of stroke volume, sampled in the stenotic jet, systematically underestimated left ventricular stroke volume. This underestimation was greater with increasing aortic stenosis severity. Critical clinical treatment decisions depend on the ability to reliably differentiate between patients with moderate and severe aortic stenosis. To achieve accurate estimation of aortic valve areas the velocity and  ow data obtained in these turbulent, high velocity jets must be accurate. In this thesis, non-stenotic and stenotic phantoms were designed and constructed to experimentally interrogate the error. It was determined that signal loss, due to intravoxel dephasing, decreased the reliability of the measured forward  ow jet velocities. Extreme signal loss in the jet eventuated in salt and pepper noise, which, with a mean velocity of zero, resulted in the underestimation. Intravoxel dephasing signal loss due to higher order motions, turbulence and spin mixing could all be mitigated by reducing the duration of the velocity sensitivity gradients and shortening the overall echo time (TE). However, improvements in an optimised PC sequence (TE 1:5ms) were not satisfactory. Flow estimates remained variable and were underestimated beyond the aortic valve. To reduce the TE further, a new phase contrast pulse sequence based on an ultrashort TE readout trajectory and velocity dependent slice excitation with gradient inversion was designed and implemented. The new sequence's TE is approximately 25% (0:65ms) of what is currently clinically available (TE 2:8ms). Good agreement in the phantom was maintained up to very high  ow rates with improved signal characteristics shown in-vivo. This new phase contrast pulse sequence is worthy of further investigation as an accurate evaluation of patients with aortic stenosis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Magnetic Resonace Imaging</field><field name="subject">Aortic stenosis</field><field name="subject">Phase contrast</field><field name="subject">turbulent jets</field><field name="subject">velocity</field><field name="subject">flow</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291500 Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4488</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spiraling Subversions: The Politics of M&#257;ori Cultural Survivance in the Critical Fictions of Patricia Grace, Paula Morris, and Kelly Ana Morey</field><field name="creator">Pistacchi, Ann Katherine</field><field name="description">The principal objective of this doctoral research is to examine the ways in which key contemporary (2000-2005) fictional writings by M&#257;ori women authors Patricia Grace, Paula Morris, and Kelly Ana Morey demonstrate &#8220;survivance&#8221; &#8211; a term used by University of New Mexico Professor Gerald Vizenor and Ohio State University Professor Chadwick Allen to refer to the ways in which indigenous authors use their texts as &#8220;a means of cultural survival that comes with denying authoritative representations of [indigenous peoples] in addition to developing an adaptable, dynamic identity that can mediate between conflicting cultures&#8221; (Allen &#8220;Thesis&#8221; 65). I argue that acts of M&#257;ori cultural survivance are manifested in the works of these three authors both internally, in terms of the actions of characters in their fictional narratives, and externally, by the authors themselves who fight for survivance in a literary publishing world that is often slow to recognize and value works of fiction that challenge traditional (Western) modes of novel form and style. Thesis chapters therefore include both extensive critical readings of Grace&#8217;s novel Dogside Story (2001), Morris&#8217;s novels Queen of Beauty (2002) and Hibiscus Coast (2005), and Morey&#8217;s novel Bloom (2003) as well as detailed biographical information based on my interviews with the authors themselves. The thesis emphasizes the ways in which each woman&#8217;s approach to writing survivance fiction is largely driven by her personal history and whakapapa. The study also asserts that Grace, Morris and Morey are producing acts of indigenous literary cultural survivance that &#8220;imagine the world healthy,&#8221; something author and critic Maxine Hong Kingston demands that contemporary writers of critical fictions must do if they are going to convince the book-buying populace &#8220;not to worship tragedy as the highest art anymore&#8221; (204). Grace, Morris, and Morey depict the creative, generative, and &#8220;healthy&#8221; aspects of M&#257;ori cultural survivance as taking place in both the real and imagined communities which they live in and write about. Their texts offer hope for the ongoing survival &#8211; and survivance &#8211; of M&#257;ori culture in the twenty-first century.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori Literature</field><field name="subject">New Zealand Literature</field><field name="subject">Women's Literature</field><field name="subject">Pacific Literature</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies::420203 Literatures of the Pacific</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies::420202 Maori literature</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4528</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"At school I&#8217;ve got a chance...": social reproduction in a New Zealand secondary school</field><field name="creator">Jones, Alison</field><field name="description">This study contributes to the contemporary debate within Western radical sociology of education regarding the relationship between the social order and the processes of schooling. It is theoretically well-established in this field that schooling is central to the maintenance of existing social relations of dominance and subordination. Focusing on the commonsense knowledge and classroom practices of two groups of fifth form adolescent girls in an inner-city all-girls Grammar school in New Zealand, the study sets out to analyse and illustrate in concrete detail some of the ideological and pedagogical processes through which schooling contributes to social reproduction. The data and discussion provide insights into the thoughts and everyday school experiences of some middle class Pakeha (European) and working class Pacific Island girls as they seriously attempt to 'get school knowledge' and, thus, the credentials which they believe the school offers the motivated and able. It also shows how teachers unwittingly recruit the active participation of students from 'race' and class groups in pedagogical interactions which often preclude the working class Pacific Island girls from acquiring the school credentials they seek. This process, and that of the school's 'provision' of the middle class Pakeha girls' academic achievement, is then 'misrecognised' by the students as the natural and fair outcome of differential talent and motivation. The theoretical framework of the thesis centres around the major contemporary questions in social theory regarding the agency-structure relationship and how social and cultural life is to be conceptualised as the dialectical product of human agents producing and produced by the social structure within which they exist.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4479</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Feedback for learning: deconstructing teachers' conceptions and use of feedback</field><field name="creator">Dixon, Helen</field><field name="description">Cognisant of the critical interplay between beliefs and practice, the current study investigated primary school teachers' beliefs and understandings about feedback, and the use of feedback to enhance student learning. Central to the investigation has been an exploration of teachers' beliefs about the nature and place of feedback in student learning and of their role and that of learners in the feedback process. Of equal importance has been an examination of the strategies and practices that teachers utilised and ascribed importance to within the feedback process, including the opportunities offered to students in relation to the development of evaluative and productive knowledge and expertise (Sadler, 1989). To facilitate this investigation, Sadler's (1989) theory of formative assessment and feedback was used as a framework to inform both the research design and subsequent analyses. Utilising an interpretive, qualitative, case study methodology the current research was conducted in two sequential phases. Phase one consisted of semi-structured interviews with a convenience sample of 20 experienced teachers. In phase two, three of these 20 participants were selected purposively for classroom observations of teachers' feedback practice during the teaching of a written language unit. These teachers also participated in a semi-structured interview following each series of observations. During both phases, additional data were generated through field notes and the collection of relevant artefacts. Together, the multiple forms of evidence provided complementary information and ensured a rich pool of data. Three recognised approaches to data analysis were utilised, namely thematic analysis, the constant comparison method and discourse analysis. The use of Sadler's theoretical framework illuminated both similarities and differences among teachers in regard to the nature, place and role of feedback in learning and teaching. As teachers' feedback discourse was examined in more detail the influence of efficacy beliefs on the uptake and enactment of new ideas and practices associated with formative assessment and feedback became apparent. Teachers' beliefs about teaching and learning were a further mediating influence, particularly in regard to how the feedback process was conceived and with respect to the norms of behaviour that teachers promoted within the feedback process. The complexity of the beliefs/practice nexus was highlighted in regard to the influence of teachers' tacit, at times outmoded beliefs, on practice. Observations revealed that each of the three case study teachers had adopted many of the strategies associated with contemporary notions of good feedback practice. However, the ways in which these strategies were implemented in the classroom was a matter of considerable variation particularly in regard to the nature of student involvement and the amount of control maintained by the teacher. Findings from this phase of the research supported Fang's (1996) consistency/inconsistency thesis. In two of the three cases there was a high degree of consistency between teachers' stated intentions and their actions while in the third the opposite was apparent. Overall, it was concluded that while all teachers had adopted elements of the contemporary feedback 'discourse' none had mastered the 'Discourse' (Gee, 1996). Looking to the future, it is argued that this Discourse cannot be enacted through the mere bolting on of strategies to existing classroom programmes. To enact the contemporary Discourse in the ways imagined three conditions must be met. Firstly, beliefs about teaching, learning and feedback must reflect those embedded in the Discourse. Secondly, there must be a close alignment between those beliefs and practice. Thirdly, teachers must acquire in-depth subject matter knowledge, which will enable them to create the dialogic forms of feedback necessary for students to become self-monitoring and self-regulatory.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4481</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Random effects models for ordinal data</field><field name="creator">Lee, Arier Chi-Lun</field><field name="description">One of the most frequently encountered types of data is where the response variables are measured on an ordinal scale. Although there have been substantial developments in the statistical techniques for the analysis of ordinal data, methods appropriate for repeatedly assessed ordinal data collected from field experiments are limited. A series of biennial field screening trials for evaluating cultivar resistance of potato to the disease, late blight, caused by the fungus Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary has been conducted by the New Zealand Institute of Crop and Food Research since 1983. In each trial, the progression of late blight was visually assessed several times during the planting season using a nine-point ordinal scale based on the percentage of necrotic tissues. As for many other agricultural field experiments, spatial differences between the experimental units is one of the major concerns in the analysis of data from the potato late blight trial. The aim of this thesis is to construct a statistical model which can be used to analyse the data collected from the series of potato late blight trials. We review existing methodologies for analysing ordinal data with mixed effects particularly those methods in the Bayesian framework. Using data collected from the potato late blight trials we develop a Bayesian hierarchical model for the analyses of repeatedly assessed ordinal scores with spatial effects, in particular the time dependence of the scores assessed on the same experimental units was modelled by a sigmoid logistic curve. Data collected from the potato late blight trials demonstrated the importance of spatial effects in agricultural field trials. These effects cannot be neglected when analysing such data.

A review of the literature provides the basis for a survey of undergraduate mathematics educators, to determine their use of technology, their views of what an Integrated Technology Mathematics Curriculum (ITMC) may resemble, and how it may be achieved. Responses to this survey, and factors identified in the literature, are used to construct a taxonomy of integrated technology. The taxonomy identifies six defining characteristics of an ITMC, each with a number of associated elements. A visual model using radar diagrams is developed to compare courses against the taxonomy, and to identify aspects needing attention in individual courses. T Evidence from an observational study of initiatives to introduce Computer Algebra Systems into undergraduate mathematics courses at The University of Auckland, firstly using CAS-calculators and latterly computer software, is examined against the taxonomy. A number of critical issues influencing the integration of these technologies are identified. These include mandating technology use in official departmental policy, attention to congruency and fairness in assessment, re-evaluating the value of topics in the curriculum, re-establishing the goals of undergraduate courses, and developing the pedagogical technical knowledge of teaching staff. The thesis concludes that effective integration of technology in undergraduate mathematics requires a recognition of, and comprehensive attention to, the interdependence of the taxonomy components. An integrated, holistic approach, which aims for curricular congruency across all elements of the taxonomy, provides the basis for a more consistent, effective and sustainable ITMC.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mathematics</field><field name="subject">Technology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Embedded Faith Journeys of Generations X and Y within New Zealand Church Communities</field><field name="creator">Johnstone, Carlton Graeme</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Generation X</field><field name="subject">Generation Y</field><field name="subject">Church</field><field name="subject">Faith Journeys</field><field name="subject">Church Switching</field><field name="subject">Church Two-Timing</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4543</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Torrent of Portyngale: a critical edition</field><field name="creator">Montgomery, Keith David</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Middle English</field><field name="subject">Romance</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4542</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The potential role of chemokines in redirecting progenitor cell migration into the lesioned striatum</field><field name="creator">Gordon, Rene&#769;e</field><field name="description">A number of studies have demonstrated directed migration of neural progenitor cells to sites of brain injury and disease. However, a detailed examination of when a cell is &#8220;born&#8221; in relation to injury induction and the migratory response of that cell has not previously been determined. This study therefore examined the temporal correlation between progenitor cell proliferation (&#8220;birth&#8221;) and neuroblast migratory response into the damaged striatum following quinolinic acid (QA) lesioning of the adult rat striatum. Retroviral labeling of subventricular zone (SVZ)&#8211;derived progenitor cells demonstrated that cell loss in the QA-lesioned striatum increased progenitor cell migration through the rostral migratory stream for up to 30 days. In addition, a population of dividing cells originating from the SVZ generated doublecortin positive neuroblasts that migrated into the damaged striatum in response to cell loss invoked by the QA lesion. The majority of doublecortin positive neuroblasts present in the damaged striatum were generated from progenitor cells dividing within two days prior to, or on the day of QA lesioning. In contrast, cells dividing two or more days following QA lesioning, migrated into the striatum and exhibited a glial phenotype. These results demonstrate that directed migration of SVZ-derived cells and neuroblast differentiation in response to QA lesioning of the striatum is acute and transient. We subsequently demonstrated a role for the chemokines MCP-1, MIP-1&#945; and GRO-&#945; in directing adult SVZ-derived progenitor cell migration following striatal cell death. MCP-1, MIP-1&#945; and GRO-&#945; were significantly upregulated in the striatum 2-3 days following QA-induced lesioning, correlating with maximum SVZ-derived progenitor cell recruitment into the lesioned striatum. We established that SVZ-derived progenitor cells express receptors for each chemokine, and demonstrated MCP-1, MIP-1&#945; and GRO-&#945; to be potent chemoattractants for SVZ-derived progenitor cells in vitro. Immunofluorescence revealed MCP-1, MIP-1&#945; and GRO-&#945; are predominantly expressed in the striatum by NG2-positive cells that appear to infiltrate from the bloodstream 6 hours following QA lesioning. These results indicate that upregulation of MCP-1, MIP-1&#945;, GRO-&#945; following striatal cell death leads to chemoattraction of SVZ-derived progenitor cells into the damaged striatum and raises a potential role for blood-derived cells in directing the recruitment of SVZ progenitor cells following brain injury.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320500 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4538</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis of boron corrole complexes</field><field name="creator">Albrett, Amelia</field><field name="description">Boron complexes of porphyrin analogues are rare and typically difficult to prepare.  The possibility of extending this chemistry further to include corroles was intriguing and provided the main motivation for this work.  The coordination chemistry of boron with corroles was explored.  The aim was to see whether boron could be coordinated within the corrole N4 core and if so whether novel or similar structural types resulted, relative to the closely related porphyrin system.  Boron halides and aryl halides were reacted with free base corroles in the presence of diisopropylethylamine.  The methodology employed was similar to that used for boron porphyrin systems.  As well as free base corrole, an N-methyl corrole and trilithiated corrole were also used as starting materials.  Several boron corrole structural types were obtained.  The reaction of free base corrole with boron trifluoroetherate led to the first structurally characterised corrole with boron bound within the N4 core, B2OF2(corrole).  From this reagent a mono-boron species, BF2(corrole) was also obtained.  With dichlorophenylborane, several boron corrole complexes were prepared including PhB2O(corrole), PhB2(corrole) and B2Ph2H(corrole).  The latter species was structurally characterised and the bridging hydride is proposed to form through a reductive coupling process.  Use of N-methyl corrole effectively blocked one boron binding site and subsequently mono-boron corroles BF2(N-methyl- corrole), BPh(OH)(N-methyl corrole) and BPhF(N-methyl corrole) were prepared in good yields.  The reaction of lithiated corrole and dichloroplenylborane afforded B2Ph2Cl(corrole).  Overall, several new boron corrole species were prepared, significantly extending the library of known boron complexes with ligands related to the porphyrin system.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">corrole</field><field name="subject">boron</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5172</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antitumour efficacy of the nitroreductase-armed oncolytic adenovirus ONYX-411NTR in combination with dinitrobenzamide mustard prodrugs in preclinical models</field><field name="creator">Singleton, Dean Craig</field><field name="description">Oncolytic viruses that selectively replicate in and lyse cancer cells are a promising approach for the treatment of tumours that are resistant to conventional therapies. Clinical experience has shown that oncolytic viruses are safe and well tolerated but possess modest single agent activity. One approach to improve the efficacy of oncolytic viruses is to utilise their tumour tropism to deliver genes encoding enzymes able to activate prodrugs. ONYX-411 is an oncolytic adenovirus that replicates in cells that carry dysfunctions in the retinoblastoma (pRb) pathway, a common hallmark of cancer. ONYX-411 was &#8216;armed&#8217; by inserting the Escherichia coli nfsB nitroreductase (NTR) gene into the E3B region of the viral genome under the control of the endogenous E3 viral transcriptional machinery. NTR is an oxygen-insensitive nitroreductase that is capable of activating dinitrobenzamide mustard (DNBM) prodrugs to cytotoxic metabolites. The main objective of this thesis was to determine the extent and mechanism of the therapeutic interaction between ONYX-411NTR and DNBM prodrugs. A fluorogenic probe was developed to monitor NTR activity non-invasively and revealed robust, replication dependent NTR activity in ONYX-411NTR-infected neoplastic but not primary human cell lines. In vitro exposure of ONYX-411NTR-infected cells to therapeutically relevant concentrations of the DNBM prodrugs (SN 27686 or PR-104A) did not inhibit virus replication.  Tumour growth delay studies of systemic ONYX-411NTR followed by prodrug demonstrated different outcomes in three models (H1299, C33A, 22Rv1). To establish predictable viral infection of tumours a pre-infection model was developed using HCT 116 xenografts. This methodology demonstrated that prodrug administration (SN 28343 or PR-104) provided significant inhibition of tumour growth without suppression of ONYX-411NTR replication. Follow-on studies using intravenous virus administration confirmed titre amplification with time (24-fold between day 3 and 13 post administration; P &lt; 0.001) and a marked survival gain for the virus/prodrug combinations. Neither the prodrugs nor ONYX-411NTR were active as single agents. The improvement in efficacy for the combination of ONYX-411NTR and prodrug was conditional on NTR-dependent prodrug activation resulting in improved virus distribution within the tumour.  PR-104 is currently in clinical development making the combination of ONYX-411NTR with PR-104 a promising strategy for cancer selective therapy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oncolytic</field><field name="subject">Prodrug</field><field name="subject">Hypoxia</field><field name="subject">Gene therapy</field><field name="subject">Virus-directed enzyme-prodrug therapy</field><field name="subject">Gene-directed enzyme-prodrug therapy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4956</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trace metal speciation in complex aquatic environments : the copper, cadmium, ferrihydrite, phthalic acid and bacterial system</field><field name="creator">Song, Yantao</field><field name="description">Trace metal speciation in aquatic environments is inherently complex due to the large number of possible interactions with dissolved and particulate components. Adsorption onto iron oxyhydroxide and bacterial surfaces, as well as the formation of metal-ligand complexes can play important roles in controlling the fate and transport of trace metals in natural environments. The objective of this study is to describe and understand metal speciation and distribution in a complex biogeochemical system by incrementally increasing the complexity from simple binary systems to a dynamic quaternary system containing a trace metal, iron oxide and bacteria that are active and metabolizing an organic ligand. Copper, cadmium, and phthalic acid (H2Lp) adsorption onto ferrihydrite in binary systems was well reproduced using the diffuse layer model (DLM). The adsorption of H2Lp adsorption was analogous to that of inorganic diprotic acids in terms of the relationship between the adsorption constants and acidity constants. In ternary systems H2Lp caused Cu2+ or Cd2+ adsorption to be either enhanced (due to surface ternary complex formation) or inhibited (due to solution complex formation) depending on the conditions. The DLM could only describe the effect of H2Lp on metal ion sorption by including ternary complexes of the form &#8801;FeOHMLp (0), where &#8801;FeOH is a surface site and M is Cu or Cd. The relationship between binary metal adsorption constants and the ternary complex adsorption constants from this and previous studies suggest several properties of ternary complexes. First, ternary complex structures on both ferrihydrite and goethite are either the same or similar. Second, those cations having large adsorption constants also have large equilibrium constants for ternary complex formation. Third, ligands forming stronger solution complexes with cations will also form stronger surface ternary complexes but because of the strong solution complexes these ligands will not necessarily enhance cation adsorption. The bacterial strain Comamonas spp. was isolated from the activated sludge of a wastewater treatment plant. Comamonas spp. could effectively degrade H2Lp in the presence of Cd2+ and ferrihydrite and was therefore chosen to study the effect of H2Lp degradation on Cd2+ speciation. Proton, cadmium and H2Lp adsorption onto Comamonas spp. were measured. The Comamonas spp. titration curve is flatter than that of ferrihydrite, indicating a higher degree of site heterogeneity at the bacterial surface. Adsorption edges of Cd2+ adsorption onto Comamonas spp. occurred over about 4~5 pH units compared to those of ferrihydrite which occurred over &#8776; 2 pH units on a dry weight basis. Comamonas spp. can accumulate a larger amount of Cd2+ than ferrihydrite especially under lower pH conditions. Proton and Cd2+ adsorption onto Comamonas spp. cells over a wide sorbent/sorbate and pH range was reasonably well described by a four site non-electrostatic model. The acid-base and Cd2+ adsorption behaviour of Comamonas spp. in this work were within the range of studies of bacteria adsorption. Phthalic acid adsorption onto inactive Comamonas spp. was negligible over a pH range of 3 to 8 and became significant only at pH &lt; 3 where H2Lp was fully protonated. This is consistent with the proposed mechanism for ligand adsorption onto bacterial surfaces which involved a balance between hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic repulsion. The presence of H2Lp decreased Cd2+ adsorption onto Comamonas spp. due to competition for Cd2+ between the bacterial cell surface and the formation of solution complexes of Cd2+. This was accurately modelled with the Cd-Lp solution species indicating that no significant surface ternary interaction occurred between Cd2+, phthalic acid and Comamonas spp.. Cadmium adsorption onto ferrihydrite-Comamonas spp. mixtures was slightly less than the simple additive predicted adsorption of ferrihydrite plus Comamonas spp.. This suggests there is a weak interaction between ferrihydrite and Comamonas spp. and this interaction could be modelled by including a generic reaction between the ferrihydrite and Comamonas spp. surface sites. Cadmium distribution in a system of inactive Comamonas spp.-ferrihydrite in the absence and presence of H2Lp could be predicted by combining the ferrihydrite and bacteria models with the inclusion of the ferrihydrite-bacteria interaction. The effects of H2Lp degradation on Cd2+ distribution were investigated in dynamic systems with live bacteria. Results showed that Cd2+ adsorption in these dynamic systems was reasonably estimated with the model parameters developed in the proceeding experiments though uncertainty exists in the dynamic process with regards to H2Lp biodegradation products and changes in the bacteria population. This thesis was therefore able to provide a better understanding of metal speciation in complex and heterogeneous realistic environments by experimentally examining and modelling metal speciation and distribution in various systems with increasing complexity. This helps to bridge the gap of quantitative description of metal speciation from simple laboratory experiment systems to real world systems, both natural and engineered.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Trace Metal; Bacteria; Ferrihydrite; Sorption</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5229</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cortical thinning and neuropsychological changes in presymptomatic Huntington's Disease</field><field name="creator">Davison, John W.</field><field name="description">Degeneration of the striatum and striatal-frontal circuits are generally thought to cause most of the neuropsychological symptoms experienced in Huntington&#8216;s Disease (HD). Advances in cortical thickness mapping (an automated MRI method for precisely measuring the cortical thickness across the entire cortex) provide a new technique for examining changes in the brain in HD. Recent studies using this technology have reported provocative results. They found significant cortical thinning in participants with early HD (Rosas et al., 2002; Rosas et al., 2008) and even in presymptomatic HD (Rosas et al., 2005). Moreover, cortical thinning was most prominent in posterior regions of the brain, with relative preservation of the anterior frontal regions. The present study replicated Rosas et al.&#8216;s (2005) study but used a larger sample of presymptomatic HD participants (n = 19) and a control group matched for age, gender and education (n = 19). Presymptomatic HD participants were divided into two groups, PreHDclose and PreHDfar, based on their estimated proximity to clinical onset. The distribution of cortical thinning was assessed using an identical MRI method to previous cortical thinning studies with HD participants. Specific neuropsychological tests were used to assess cognitive and mood changes that may be associated with cortical thinning. It was hypothesised that cortical thinning would be more evident in posterior than frontal cortical regions. It was also hypothesised that presymptomatic HD participants would perform more poorly than controls on tests that are subserved primarily by specific posterior cortical regions, but not on tests that are subserved by anterior cortical regions. Lastly, it was predicted that poorer performance in the neuropsychological measures would be associated with greater thinning in cortical regions that are important during performance of these tasks. Consistent with predictions, the presymptomatic HD group showed regionally-specific cortical thinning which was most prominent in the posterior cortices, particularly around the right parieto-temporal-occipital (PTO) junction. Thinning occurred in people up to 15 years before clinical onset, with little to no thinning before that. The presymptomatic HD group, and particularly the PreHDclose participants, performed significantly worse than controls in 2 of the 6 cognitive tests that are subserved primarily by posterior cortical regions (the Judgment of Line iii Orientation test and modified Roadmap Test), but not in tests that are subserved primarily by frontal cortical regions. Correlational analyses showed a number of regionally-specific relationships between thinning and cognitive performance, although the distribution of these relationships did not generally support our region-of-interest predictions. The results contribute to a better characterisation of the cortical and neuropsychological changes that occur early in the development of HD, and provide tentative support for cortical thickness mapping as a valid and sensitive measure for assessing cortical changes in presymptomatic HD.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cortex</field><field name="subject">Neuropsychology</field><field name="subject">Huntington's disease</field><field name="subject">Cognitive</field><field name="subject">Cognition</field><field name="subject">HD</field><field name="subject">Dementia</field><field name="subject">MRI</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4955</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The management of children's asthma in primary care : Are there ethnic differences in care?</field><field name="creator">Crengle, Suzanne Marie</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted until August 2010, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ethnic disparities</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Pacific</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Asthma</field><field name="subject">Primary care</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Health services research</field><field name="subject">Kaupapa Maori Research</field><field name="subject">Quality of care</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321208 Primary health care</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321207 Indigenous health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321210 Community child health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321202 Epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4957</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mechanism of washback on teaching and learning</field><field name="creator">Mizutani, Satomi</field><field name="description">The current research investigated the mechanism of the phenomenon known as washback (i.e., the impact of assessment on teaching and learning) in the context of a new national standards-based assessment system in New Zealand, particularly focusing on the area of the teaching and learning of Japanese as a foreign language. The National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA) was progressively implemented across all subjects in the final three years of secondary schooling from 2002. It replaced norm-referenced assessments and aimed to function as assessment for learning as well as of learning. The research consisted of three studies. Studies One and Two investigated washback effects of NCEA as perceived by teachers and students of Japanese, and beliefs about NCEA which contributed to the washback effects. Participants claimed that the majority of the intended positive washback effects were promoted by the assessment, but the nature of the washback depended on beliefs about NCEA held by teachers and students. Students tended to report more negative washback of NCEA than did teachers. Study Three explored the role that contextual factors (e.g., subject, gender) and beliefs might play in mediating washback. This large-scale study involved teachers and students of Japanese, French, History, and Mathematics. Teacher and Student Questionnaires were developed to investigate washback of NCEA and beliefs about NCEA, Teaching, Learning, and Teacher Efficacy as well as to collect relevant background information on the participants. The study revealed that some contextual factors played a role in mediating certain types of beliefs and washback effects. The results also confirmed the crucial role that beliefs play in mediating washback, indicating that positive washback was promoted when participants&#8217; beliefs were in line with the intentions of the assessment. It is concluded that for educational reform through assessment change to be successful, stake holders&#8217; beliefs about the role of assessment may need to be altered. A model is presented to describe the mechanism of washback, showing how washback could be mediated directly and indirectly by contextual factors and beliefs.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4545</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of stem cell development by Runx transcription factors</field><field name="creator">Lam, Enid Yi Ni</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Runx</field><field name="subject">zebrafish</field><field name="subject">transgenic</field><field name="subject">haematopiesis</field><field name="subject">stem cells</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4961</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unintentional falls at home among young and middle-aged adults: the influence of alcohol</field><field name="creator">Kool, Bridget</field><field name="description">Aim To investigate the epidemiology of unintentional fall-related injuries at home among young and middle-aged adults (25 to 59 years) and to investigate the contribution of alcohol to these injuries. Methods Routinely collected national fall injury data were analysed to describe the incidence and characteristics of falls at home resulting in death or hospital inpatient treatment among this age group in New Zealand. A systematic review of the published literature evaluated the epidemiological evidence quantifying the risk of falls associated with acute and usual alcohol consumption in this age group. A population-based case-control study was conducted in Auckland, New Zealand over a 12-month period. Cases were 335 people aged 25 to 59 years who were admitted to hospital or died as a result of unintentional non-occupational falls at home. Controls were 352 people randomly selected from the electoral roll from the same age group as the cases. The participants or next-of-kin completed a structured interview to ascertain data on personal and lifestyle factors including alcohol consumption. Findings The review of national injury data found that almost a third of unintentional falls resulting in an in-patient admission among working-age people were recorded as occurring at home. For every death there were about 150 in-patient hospital admissions. The systematic review identified only a small number of studies but showed an increased risk of unintentional falls in this age group with increasing exposure to alcohol use. The magnitude of this risk varied considerably across studies with most estimates being relatively imprecise. There was modest evidence of a dose-response relationship with acute alcohol use. The association between usual alcohol use and fall risk was inconclusive. The case-control study revealed that after controlling for confounding, the consumption of two or more standard alcoholic drinks in the preceding six hours relative to none is associated with a significantly increased risk of fall-related injury. Approximately 21% of unintentional non-occupational falls at home in this population was attributed to this risk. No association between hazardous drinking as a usual pattern and falls was found when the analyses were adjusted for confounders. Conclusion A significant proportion of unintentional fall-related injuries among the working-aged New Zealanders occur at home. Consuming two or more drinks in the previous six hours was strongly associated with unintentional non-occupational falls at home that result in admission to hospital or death in this age group. This largely unrecognised problem should be addressed in further research and in falls prevention programmes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Accidental falls</field><field name="subject">alcohol, drinking</field><field name="subject">accidents, home</field><field name="subject">injury</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4960</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of chemical gradients across porous silicon sensors</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Corrina</field><field name="description">This thesis investigated the formation of compositional gradients across 0.5 &#8211; 1 cm of porous silicon layers which had thicknesses of 2 &#8211; 10 &#956;m. These compositional gradients were then characterised, and their potential use as vapour sensors was probed. Surface composition gradients have been reported on flat surfaces, but this is the first time that they have been reported on a three-dimensional material with controlled pore geometry. Chemical gradients have been generated across the surface of porous silicon by performing electrochemical attachment of organohalides with an asymmetric electrode arrangement, and by chemical hydrosilylation of alkenes in the presence of a diffusion gradient of diazonium salts across the porous silicon surface. Samples with electrochemical gradients of methyl, pentyl acetate, and decyl and using chemical hydrosilylation with gradients of undecanoic acid and decyl groups. The latter four gradient-modified porous silicon types have been &#8216;endcapped&#8217; with methyl groups to give improved stability and greater hydrophobicity. The pentyl acetate and undecanoic groups have been converted into pentanol and undecanoate groups respectively to increase the hydrophilicity of these porous silicon surfaces. The gradients have been characterised using two-dimensional FTIR microspectrophotometry and water contact angle measurements. The interaction of these gradient porous silicon samples with ethanol, heptane, toluene and 2-hexanol vapours have been monitored either by UV-Vis reflectance spectroscopy at selected points across the surface or more globally using a digital camera. The undecanoate gradient porous silicon sample showed a large difference in optical response between the undecanoate end and the methyl end of the gradient when exposed to water vapour, showing that imposition of a chemical gradient can alter the sensing character of porous silicon in a controllable manner.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5167</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New control strategy for CNC machines via STEP-NC</field><field name="creator">Wang, Hongqiang</field><field name="description">The contemporary product design and manufacturing environment requires a bidirectional and seamless data flow throughout all stages of data transactions. The establishment of STEP (STandard for Exchange of Product data) offers manufacturers a new method to exchange product data in the entire product life cycle. As an extension to STEP, STEP-NC provides the potential to finally close the gap between design and manufacturing in the drive for a complete, integrated product development environment. The STEP-NC data model is a long overdue improvement in the domain of computer numerical controls (CNC) where G-codes have been in use for more than half a century. STEP-NC brings richer information to CNCs presenting an opportunity for the development of more intelligent, interoperable and informative machining. The research work documented in this thesis introduces a fully STEP-compliant CNC system with an aim to solve the problems faced by the current CNC systems, e.g. disconnection with the upper-stream activities. The research is based on the premise that a STEP-NC program can document &#8220;generic&#8221; manufacturing information (whatto- do). This way, a STEP-NC program can be made machine-independent and has an advantage over the conventional G-code based NC program that is always generated for a specific CNC machine. The core of the STEP-compliant CNC system is the mapping mechanism which accepts STEP-NC data and translates it into the type of G-code that a specific controller can understand. The STEP-compliant CNC system has two principal elements, a STEP-NC Adapter and a STEP-NC Converter. The STEP-NC Adapter takes a generic STEP-NC program as its input and produces a more specific version of the STEP-NC program by &#8220;adapting&#8221; it to a local manufacturing environment and capabilities. This native STEP-NC file is a localised version of the generic STEP-NC file. It may be re-adapted to another manufacturing environment. The STEP-NC converter takes a native STEP-NC file and converts it to the required machine control data, i.e. G-codes that are ready to be loaded to the targeted CNC controller. The conversion process is also called a mapping or translating process that utilises the manufacturing environment databases developed for specific machine tools, or rather CNC controllers. The use of function block (IEC 61499) technology gives the system robustness and modularity. The STEP-NC adapter and converter are so developed that they can be embedded into a future CNC controller, making it a STEP-NC enabled controller. The system offers ample benefits to the CNC users by providing an interface for the STEP-NC data that carries rich information and the interface itself is also more userfriendly. It realises a long-awaited paradigm of common interface for CNC machine tools. With this system in place, one generic STEP-NC program can be made to drive different CNC machine tools, making NC programs portable and universally compatible. This system supports the scenario of &#8220;design anywhere and build anywhere&#8221;.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290500 Mechanical and Industrial Engineering::290501 Mechanical engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5228</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How do people manage their documents?: an empirical investigation into personal document management practices among knowledge workers</field><field name="creator">Henderson, Sarah</field><field name="description">Personal document management is the activity of managing a collection of digital documents performed by the owner of the documents, and consists of creation/acquisition, organisation, finding and maintenance.  Document management is a pervasive aspect of digital work, but has received relatively little attention from researchers. The hierarchical file system used by most people to manage their documents has not conceptually changed in decades.  Although revolutionary prototypes have been developed, these have not been grounded in a thorough understanding of document management behaviour and therefore have not resulted in significant changes to document management interfaces.  Improvements in understanding document management can result in productivity gains for knowledge workers, and since document management is such a common activity, small improvements can deliver large gains. The aim of this research was to understand how people manage their personal document collections and to develop guidelines for the development of tools to support personal document management. A field study was conducted that included interviews, a survey and file system snapshot.  The interviews were conducted with ten participants to investigate their document management strategies, structures and struggles.  In addition to qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews, a novel investigation technique was developed in the form of a file system snapshot which collects information about document structures and derives a number of metrics which describe the document structure.  A survey was also conducted, consisting of a questionnaire and a file system snapshot, which enabled the findings of the field study to be validated, and to collect information from a greater number of participants.  The results of this research culminated in (1) development of a conceptual framework highlighting the key personal document management  attitudes, behaviours and concerns; (2) model of basic operations that any document management system needs to provide; (3) identification of piling, filing and structuring as three key document management strategies; (4) guidelines for the development of user interfaces to support document management, including specific guidelines for each document management strategy.  These contributions both improve knowledge of personal document management on which future research can build, and provide practical advice to document management system designers which should result in the development of more usable system.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personal document management</field><field name="subject">document management</field><field name="subject">personal information management</field><field name="subject">information systems</field><field name="subject">human-computer interaction</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5230</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc Wine  Using Trained Sensory Panels</field><field name="creator">Lund, Cynthia M.</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT  A core tool of sensory science is the use of trained descriptive panels.  This research describes an investigation into the role of motivation in the performance of trained panels and the use of a trained panel to develop a better understanding of the perception of Sauvignon blanc wines. Substantial investment in time and money is directed towards ensuring trained panels perform optimally.  Having selected a panel, the panel leader needs to ensure that panellists provide accurate, reliable data.  Panellist motivation is also an important factor to consider.  While performance psychology, education and sport science fields have researched motivation extensively, knowledge about panellist motivation within sensory science is limited.  However, findings from existing research in these other areas - which suggest an important role for autonomy, competence and relatedness - can be applied to sensory panels in order to increase intrinsic motivation. The initial part of the research investigated the fundamental factors that affect and influence panellists&#8217; motivation and participation.  A survey (n=74) revealed that extra income and a general interest in food were the key drivers in inspiring people to become panellists, whilst enjoyment in being a panellist, interest in food, and extra income were key drivers for people to remain panellists.  In a second survey, the intrinsic motivation of seven trained panels from four countries (n=108) was assessed.  External panels were found to be more intrinsically motivated than internal panels.  Experienced panellists had an increased perception of competence, which is a key factor for people to be intrinsically motivated.  Understanding motivational frameworks currently used in other research fields and integrating them into existing panel training protocols may enhance and sustain panellists&#8217; intrinsic motivation. A trained panel (n=14) was then used in the second part of the thesis to identify key flavours in Sauvignon blanc wines from Australia, France, New Zealand, Spain, South Africa and USA.  Sixteen characteristics were identified and measured, including sweet sweaty passionfruit, capsicum, passionfruit skin/stalk, boxwood/cat&#8217;s urine, grassy, mineral/flinty, citrus, bourbon, apple lolly/candy, tropical, mint, fresh asparagus, canned asparagus, stonefruit, apple and snowpea. Principal component analysis was used to describe differences between regions and countries.  Sauvignon blanc wines from Marlborough, New Zealand (NZ), were described by tropical and sweet sweaty passionfruit characteristics, while French and South African Sauvignon blanc wines were described as having flinty/mineral and bourbon-like flavors.  Chemical analyses of these wines also showed that Marlborough, NZ wines had more methoxypyrazine and thiol compounds.  A consumer study (n=109) showed that New Zealanders significantly prefer New Zealand style Sauvignon blanc. The final part of this research focused on using trained panellists to explore the interactions between volatile and non-volatile wine compounds and their effects on the aroma profile of New Zealand Sauvignon blanc wine.  Four volatile aroma compounds that are important in New Zealand Sauvignon blanc wine were studied (isobutyl methoxypyrazine [MIBP], 3-mercaptohexanol [3MH], 3-mercaptohexanol acetate [3MHA], and ethyl decanoate).  Each of these four aroma compounds were assessed in combination with three non-volatile polyphenolic compounds commonly found in Sauvignon blanc wine: catechin, caffeic acid and quercetin.  Results showed each polyphenol had a unique effect when blended with a specific aroma compound, either suppressing, accentuating, or showing little effect on the perception of the aroma compounds.  The perception of MIBP, 3MH, and ethyl decanoate were largely suppressed by the added polyphenols, with a few exceptions.  The perception of 3MH was accentuated with the addition of caffeic acid, and the perception of 3MHA was accentuated with the addition of catechin.  The interactive effects of aroma compounds with polyphenols likely reflect non-covalent associations in the wine solution that reduce the volatility of the aroma compounds.  With an understanding of the interactive effects of volatile and non-volatile compounds in wine, winemakers might optimize the impact of selected volatile compounds by managing polyphenol levels, supporting their efforts to attain desirable wine aroma profiles.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sauvignon blanc wine</field><field name="subject">trained panel</field><field name="subject">sensory analysis</field><field name="subject">motivation</field><field name="subject">region</field><field name="subject">consumer</field><field name="subject">thiols</field><field name="subject">methoxy pyrazines</field><field name="subject">perception</field><field name="subject">volatiles</field><field name="subject">non volatiles</field><field name="subject">polyphenols</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5168</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Getting evidence to and from general practice consultations for cardiovascular risk management using computerised decision support</field><field name="creator">Wells, Linda Susan Mary</field><field name="description">Abstract Background Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has an enormous impact on the lives and health of New Zealanders. There is substantial epidemiological evidence that supports identifying people at high risk of CVD and treating them with lifestyle and drug-based interventions. If fully implemented, this targeted high risk approach could reduce future CVD events by over 50%. Recent studies have shown that a formal CVD risk assessment to the systematically identify high risk patients is rarely done in routine New Zealand general practice and audits of CVD risk management have shown large evidence-practice gaps. The CVD risk prediction score recommended by New Zealand guidelines for identifying high CVD risk patients was derived from the US Framingham Heart Study using data collected between the 1960s and 1980s. This score has only modest prediction accuracy and there are particular concerns about it&#8217;s validity for New Zealand sub-populations such as high risk ethnic groups or people with diabetes. Aims The overall aims of this thesis were to investigate the potential of a computerised decision support system (CDSS) to improve the assessment and management of CVD risk in New Zealand general practice while simultaneously developing a sustainable cohort study that could be used for validating and improving CVD risk prediction scores and related research. Methods An environmental scan of the New Zealand health care setting&#8217;s readiness to support a CDSS was conducted .The epidemiological evidence was reviewed to assess the effect of decision support systems on the quality of health care and the types and functionality of systems most likely to be successful. This was followed by a focused systematic review of randomised trials evaluating the impact of CDSS on CVD risk assessment and management practices and patient CVD outcomes in primary care. A web-based CDSS (PREDICT) was collaboratively developed. This rules-based provider-initiated system with audit and feedback and referral functionalities was fully integrated with general practice electronic medical records in a number of primary health organisations (PHOs). The evidence-based content was derived from national CVD and diabetes guidelines. When clinicians used PREDICT at the time of a consultation, treatment recommendations tailored to the patient&#8217;s CVD and diabetes risk profile were delivered to support decision-making within seconds. Simultaneously, the patient&#8217;s CVD risk profiles were securely stored on a central server. With PHO permission, anonymised patient data were linked via encrypted patient National Health Index numbers to national death and hospitalisation data. Three analytical studies using these data are described in this thesis. The first evaluated changes in GP risk assessment practice following implementation of PREDICT; the second investigated patterns of use of the CDSS by GPs and practice nurses; and the third describes the emerging PREDICT cohort and a preliminary validation of risk prediction scores. Results Given the rapid development of organised primary care since the 1990&#8217;s, the high degree of general practice computerisation and the New Zealand policy (health, informatics, privacy) environment, the introduction of a CDSS into the primary care setting was deemed feasible. The evidence for the impact of CDSS in general has been moderately favourable in terms of improving desired practice. Of the randomised trials of CDSS for assessing or managing CVD risk, about two-thirds reported improvements in provider processes and two-fifths reported some improvements in intermediate patient outcomes. No adverse effects were reported. Since 2002, the PREDICT CDSS has been implemented progressively in PHOs within Northland and the three Auckland regional District Health Board catchments, covering a population of 1.5 million. A before-after audit conducted in three large PHOs showed that CVD risk documentation increased four fold after the implementation of PREDICT. To date, the PREDICT dataset includes around 63,000 risk assessments conducted on a cohort of over 48,000 people by over 1000 general practitioners and practice nurses. This cohort has been followed from baseline for a median of 2.12 years. During that time 2655 people died or were hospitalised with a CVD event. Analyses showed that the original Framingham risk score was reasonably well calibrated overall but underestimated risk in high risk ethnic groups. Discrimination was only modest (AUC 0.701). An adjusted Framingham score, recommended by the New Zealand Guideline Group (NZGG) overestimated 5-year event rates by around 4-7%, in effect lowering the threshold for drug therapy to about 10% 5-year predicted CVD risk. The NZGG adjusted score (AUC 0.676) was less discriminating than the Framingham score and over-adjusted for high risk ethnic groups. For the cohort aged 30-74 years, the NZGG-recommended CVD risk management strategy identified almost half of the population as eligible for lifestyle management +/- drug therapy and this group generated 82% of all CVD events. In contrast the original Framingham score classified less than one-third of the cohort as eligible for individualised management and this group generated 71% of the events that occurred during follow-up. Implications This research project has demonstrated that a CDSS tool can be successfully implemented on a large scale in New Zealand general practice. It has assisted practitioners to improve the assessment and management of CVD at the time of patient consultation. Simultaneously, PREDICT has cost-effectively generated one of the largest cohorts of M&#257;ori and non-M&#257;ori ever assembled in New Zealand. As the cohort grows, new CVD risk prediction scores will be able to be developed for many New Zealand sub-populations. It will also provide clinicians and policy makers with the information needed to determine the trade-offs between the resources required to manage increasing proportions of the populations and the likely impact of management on preventing CVD events.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">decision support system</field><field name="subject">cardiovascular disease</field><field name="subject">family practice</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321202 Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280109 Decision support and group support systems</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4959</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The performance of DS-CDMA cellular systems with variable-bit-rate traffic</field><field name="creator">Sowden, Bradley Claude</field><field name="description">The deployment of third generation (3G) cellular systems is resulting in a transition from cellular systems that predominantly carry constant-bit-rate (CBR) voice traffic to multi-service packet based systems that predominantly carry variable-bit-rate (VBR) traffic. With 3G DS-CDMA cellular systems there is a direct relationship between user traffic and propagation dependent performance as additional traffic causes increased system interference. This thesis investigates the impact of VBR traffic on the propagation dependent performance of DS-CDMA cellular systems that utilise frame-by-frame dynamic resource allocation on the radio channel. A DS-CDMA cellular system model is developed and the downlink performance of both outdoor macro-cellular and indoor pico-cellular systems is evaluated with a variety of traffic types. Both traffic scheduling performance and propagation dependent performance are evaluated as the two are inter-linked. Scenarios are identified where propagation dependent performance is sensitive to the statistical properties of the user traffic streams and it is shown that a significant performance difference potentially exists between different traffic types when the number of users per cell is low. When a significant performance difference does exist, burstier more variable traffic generally results in superior propagation dependent performance. The base transceiver station (BTS) transmitter power mean and variance provides a good indication of the level of propagation dependent performance regardless of the specific traffic type. Traffic scheduling policies that deliberately reduce the variability of user traffic streams are considered and in terms of propagation dependent performance these are shown to have a minimal impact on the performance difference between different traffic types. The implications of VBR traffic on DS-CDMA cellular system design are outlined and it is shown that VBR traffic can be approximated as CBR traffic in many scenarios and this is a convenient approximation as it simplifies system design and detailed traffic models do not need to be developed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5211</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of anthocyanin accumulation in apple by the transcription factor MdMYB10</field><field name="creator">Espley, Richard V.</field><field name="description">Anthocyanin concentration is an important determinant of the colour of many fruits. In apple (Malus x domestica), centuries of breeding have produced numerous varieties in which levels of anthocyanin pigment vary widely and change differently in response to environmental and developmental stimuli. The apple fruit cortex is usually colourless, although germplasm does exist where the cortex is highly pigmented due to the accumulation of anthocyanins, carotenoids or chlorophylls. From studies in a diverse array of plants species, it is apparent that anthocyanin biosynthesis is controlled at the level of transcription. In this thesis the transcript levels of the anthocyanin biosynthetic genes in a red-fleshed apple are compared with a white-fleshed cultivar. A MYB transcription factor (TF), MdMYB10, was isolated and is shown to be similar in sequence to known anthocyanin regulators in other species. Further, this TF is shown to induce anthocyanin accumulation in both heterologous and homologous systems, generating pigmented patches in transient assays in tobacco leaves and highly pigmented apple plants following stable transformation with constitutively expressed MdMYB10. Efficient induction of anthocyanin biosynthesis in transient assays by MdMYB10 was dependent on the co-expression of two bHLH proteins from apple, MdbHLH3 and MdbHLH33. A strong correlation between expression of MdMYB10 and apple anthocyanin levels during fruit development suggests that this TF is responsible for controlling anthocyanin biosynthesis in apple fruit; in the red-fleshed cultivar and in the skin of other varieties, there is an induction of MdMYB10 expression concurrent with colour formation during development. Mutations in the genes encoding for either the biosynthetic or transcriptional regulation of the anthocyanin pathway have been linked to colour phenotypes. Generally this is a loss of function resulting in a reduction or a change in the distribution of anthocyanin. The upstream regulatory region of MdMYB10 was investigated and found to contain a rearrangement. This modification is responsible for increasing the level of anthocyanin throughout the plant to produce a striking phenotype that includes red foliage and red fruit flesh. It consists of a series of multiple repeats, forming a minisatellite-like structure that comprises five direct tandem repeats of a 23 base pair sequence. This MdMYB10 rearrangement is present in all the red foliage apple varieties and species tested, but in none of the white fleshed varieties. Transient assays demonstrated that the 23 bp sequence motif is a target of the MdMYB10 protein itself, and the number of repeat units correlates with an increase in transactivation by MdMYB10 protein. The repeat motif is capable of binding MdMYB10 protein in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Taken together, these results indicate that a rearrangement in the promoter of MdMYB10 has generated an autoregulatory locus and this autoregulation is sufficient to account for the increase in MdMYB10 transcript levels and subsequent ectopic accumulation of anthocyanins throughout the plant. Characterisation of MdMYB10 and the rearrangement in the promoter region has implications for the development of new varieties through classical breeding or a biotechnological approach. Understanding whether this mutation is simply an allele of other recently published apple MYB TFs, or if this is the only R2R3 MYB TF involved in apple anthocyanin response, is a challenge for future research.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5170</field></doc><doc><field name="title">You bet your life...and mine!  Contemporary Samoan gambling in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Perese, Lana</field><field name="description">Pacific peoples in New Zealand are identified as having the highest risk and prevalence of problem and pathological gambling behaviours.  Despite increasing awareness of gambling related harms in New Zealand there is a dearth of research on Pacific gambling, the reasons for problem gambling and the risks gambling poses for these populations. This thesis examines contemporary Samoan gambling and problem gambling through the perceptions and in-depth understandings of thirty-two Samoan participants.  Pacific research methodologies premised on Pacific epistemologies, practices and protocols provide the cultural framework that supports the qualitative methods used in this research.  These cultural methodologies also provide the context within which data gathered is analysed, interpreted and discussed.  The method used within this thesis is an amalgam of Pacific and grounded theory approaches. The research identifies Samoan cultural factors that play a major role in understanding contemporary Samoan gambling.  It links the deep-rooted cultural understandings of va/teu le va that are associated with early Samoan games and sports with contemporary Samoan gambling behaviours and practices.  The research provides cultural understandings of the complex conditions and processes within which contemporary Samoan gambling and problem gambling are embedded, constituted and differentiated for Samoan people in New Zealand.  These understandings are used to explore the extent to which gambling impacts harm Samoan individuals, families and communities.  The research also describes cultural factors that are associated with motivations for contemporary Samoan gambling. It demonstrates that concepts such as &#8216;winning&#8217;, &#8216;fundraising&#8217; and &#8216;socialising&#8217; act as primary motivations for engagement and explores ways in which these drivers challenge the va and teu le va that are inherent within fa&#8217;aSamoa. The potency of these new motivations is illustrated through consideration of cultural practices such as fa&#8217;alavelave, status acquisition, religion and hospitality.  These factors are not only complex but they also play an important role in the initiation, development and maintenance of Samoan gambling.   This thesis articulates a broad knowledge base of cultural factors, practices, influences and understandings that are associated with contemporary Samoan gambling in New Zealand.  It highlights how Samoan (problem) gambling while often rationalised in terms of aiga enhancing precepts is in reality most often undermining and eroding of aiga values and practices. In light of these findings, contextually effective Samoan solutions incorporated into Public Health interventions are recommended as a means of addressing the alarming gambling-related issues facing Samoan people in New Zealand.   A greater emphasis on aiga/familial interventions rather than focusing on individuals is crucial since aiga and close social networks are identified as playing an important role in the development and maintenance of gambling behaviour and can also be effective catalysts and supports for behavioural change.  Further research is indicated to better understand and develop the knowledge-base on contemporary Samoan gambling with specific relevance to Samoan youth and adult populations in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Samoan Gambling</field><field name="subject">Pacific epistemologies</field><field name="subject">Samoan epistemologies</field><field name="subject">Samoan Problem Gambling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4958</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Toward empirical IP host traffic measurement in passive network measurement</field><field name="creator">Lee, Dong Jin</field><field name="description">An IP flow represents a group of packets that share the same attribute such as their source address. The ever-growing network traffic produces an enormous number of flows. Recent studies attempt to simplify and mine flows in order to understand the network&#8217;s behaviour. The traditional technique of packet aggregation to 5-tuple flows provides understanding of the flows themselves, but fails to capture an understanding of the aggregated end-point that generates flows: the IP host. This thesis describes the design, development and analysis of a measurement method that identifies an IP host from network traffic. A conceptual model of IP host aggregations has been designed to summarize traffic: from 5-tuple to 2-tuple and finally to 1-tuple IP host. Using the framework, various observations and analyses have been conducted at the host level, including empirical distributions and behaviour relationships. Several host characteristics and applications are examined from real-world network data, such as characterizing host interaction variability and identifying hosts that are potentially significant.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5237</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms underlying hypoxic ischemic injury to the developing brain: The significance of matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9</field><field name="creator">Ranasinghe, Himani Sumudumalee</field><field name="description">Perinatal hypoxic ischemic (HI) injury is a leading cause of long-term neurological complications in newborn babies. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of endopeptidases that are capable of degrading the extracellular matrix (ECM) components. They are considered to be integral in many physiological processes.  However, recently it has been demonstrated that the inappropriate activity of these proteases, particularly MMP-2 and 9, contribute to the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia in the adult brain. Given that ECM disruption is frequently observed following injury to the developing brain, it is possible that MMPs play an important role in HI injury processes in the developing brain. Therefore, this thesis evaluated the hypothesis that MMP-2 and 9 participate in the pathophysiology of HI injury to the developing brain. Since ECM remodelling is a fundamental process during brain development it was important to first characterise the MMP-2 and 9 profiles in the normal developing forebrain. We demonstrated that MMP-2, which mainly was observed in cortical plate neurons, declined with age, thus indicating a potential role in the development and differentiation of the cortical plate. Conversely, MMP-9 was increased with age, particularly during active myelination, indicating that it may contribute in myelination. Secondly, we showed an upregulation of MMP-9 within the ischemic core during the early hours following HI injury, suggesting that MMP-9 may be involved in the development of delayed injury processes following hypoxic ischemia. On the contrary, MMP-2 was strongly upregulated during a later stage following injury surrounding the ischemic core possibly suggesting that it plays a role in wound repair processes. Thirdly, the profiles of tissue (tPA) and urokinase (uPA) plasminogen activators were characterised following HI injury since they are known to be major upstream activators of MMPs. uPA upregulation paralleled that of MMP-2 suggesting a function for uPA in wound repair processes following HI injury to the developing brain through activation of MMP-2. In contrast with uPA, tPA activity remained unaffected following injury at both ages. Finally, MMP-9 activity was inhibited using a very specific MMP-2/9 inhibitor, SB-3CT, to determine if the MMP-9 deficiency protects the developing brain from HI injury. The elevated MMP-9 activity following HI injury was attenuated by the SB-3CT treatment. Although SB-3CT failed to confer any significant neuroprotection, we recommend that further investigations are needed before discounting the role of MMP-9 during HI injury to the developing brain. In conclusion, we suggest that MMP-9 is induced following an insult to the developing brain potentially contributing to the delayed neuronal death whilst MMP-2 is involved in essential developmental, differentiation and wound repair processes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brain</field><field name="subject">Ischemia</field><field name="subject">Hypoxia</field><field name="subject">Injury</field><field name="subject">Developmental</field><field name="subject">MMP-9</field><field name="subject">MMP-2</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4962</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visions of madness: an investigation into cinematic representations of unreason</field><field name="creator">Manley, Dean</field><field name="description">Madness is often associated with violence, criminality, and degenerative human failure in stigmatising media reports, and these are most people&#8217;s site of information about madness. Despite (or maybe because of) reductions in stigmatising reporting,  negative perceptions of madness persist, notwithstanding stringent broadcast standards and expensive public health campaigns. When regulation dominates, extreme views can move underground  into less monitored areas such as film which enjoys a wider scope to explore ideas and issues concerning a culture. Agencies which have more freedom to represent madness beyond objective journalistic conventions can be more subversive. This work takes Foucault&#8217;s archaeology of madness (among other works) as its point of departure to look at cinematic representations of madness, exploring the notion that cinema reflects and reinforces the asylum discourse. It investigates cinema as a strategy of neurotic reiteration to confine madness in narrative&#8212;to close down the spectre of the Other&#8212;in cultural structures to exorcise it from the collective consciousness. Commercial imperatives drive stigmatising representations of madness, drawing on cultural loadings inherent in the asylum discourse, trading on demonising and pathologising to exacerbate drama and tension, essential elements of tragedy. Foucault&#8217;s framework is the basis for detailed analyses and close readings of a selection of cinematic representations, critiquing their role as constituent of, and constituting, the spectacle of madness. The films considered are from New Zealand and dominant (i.e. Hollywood) cinema in order to permit comparisons between representations here and overseas. This work follows my master&#8217;s thesis (1999), which used a similar methodology to examine representations of suicide in cinema in four popular films. Here, I look at the ideas that represent knowledge and authority about madness as represented in discourses associated with cinema. I look at loadings of illness, moral failure, Otherness, animality, and the mechanisms through which the asylum discourse of containment and spectacle is validated (or otherwise). This links with Fuery&#8217;s discussion of madness and cinema, and madness as a necessary aspect of spectatorship that makes cinema possible. It also connects to my current employment on a project addressing stigma and discrimination against people with experience of madness.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">film</field><field name="subject">madness</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410300 Cinema, Electronic Arts and Media Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5166</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multi-agent based ambient intelligence platform</field><field name="creator">Wang, Kevin I-Kai</field><field name="description">The vision of Ambient Intelligence (AmI) can be realised through the integration of embedded technologies, distributed systems, middleware and human machine interfaces and many research efforts have been made to advance these technologies. However, the exclusiveness of these ambient intelligence technologies has reduced their practical values. In this thesis, a novel AmI platform is proposed to facilitate the integration and interoperability of various technologies in the process of developing AmI applications. The platform defines the overall software/hardware architecture and communication interfaces and provides a common base for development, operation and future adaptation of AmI applications.	The proposed platform consists of four layers, the physical ubiquitous environment, middleware, multi-agent system (MAS) and application layer. The ubiquitous environment layer accommodates any type of embedded device network for interconnecting different sensors, actuators and computing devices. The middleware layer is built using an IP-based service discovery protocol, Universal Plug and Play (UPnP), which provides a unique communication interface for controlling and monitoring embedded devices. The MAS handles the core distributed and adaptive control functionality and communication with user interfaces. The application layer contains any type of user interface for different AmI applications. An XML-based content language is designed with an XML schema and seven XML messages. The content language standardises the way of interpreting contents of communication between different user interfaces and the MAS.	Based on the proposed platform, a complete AmI application prototype called Distributed Embedded Intelligence Room (DEIR) has been implemented. Four different device networks, the SmartHouse network, IP network, Bluetooth and Zigbee network, have been integrated in DEIR to interconnect various embedded sensors and devices. The MAS is implemented using Java Agent DEvelopment framework (JADE). Four application specific agents, known as the UPnP control point agent, IP interface agent, fuzzy inference agent and decision tree agent, are designed and implemented. The UPnP control point agent provides MAS the ability to monitor and to control the underlying hardware devices through the UPnP middleware layer. The IP interface agent handles communication with user interfaces over socket connections. Fuzzy inference and decision tree agents are implemented to provide personalised learning and automated control capabilities. Three user interfaces, including a remote graphical user interface, a mobile PDA interface and a 3D virtual reality interface are implemented. Contents of communication between these user interfaces and the MAS are encoded using the proposed XML content language and transmitted over socket connections.	The AmI application prototype, DEIR, has demonstrated the ability of integrating multiple device networks and multiple user interfaces, which is a vital feature for most AmI applications. Two case studies have been carried out to incorporate two adaptive learning and controlling algorithms, known as the adaptive online fuzzy inference system (AOFIS) and ID3 decision tree algorithm, in the MAS of DEIR. The results of case studies show that DEIR has the ability of incorporating multiple adaptive control algorithms as multiple agents. In addition, comparable or better offline learning accuracy and learning speed have been achieved by DEIR compared with other advanced adaptive control algorithms.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ambient Intelligence</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5212</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolution of the brain and sensory systems of the kiwi</field><field name="creator">Corfield, Jeremy R.</field><field name="description">Kiwi (Apteryx spp.) have evolved under unique evolutionary pressures and uniquely occupy a nocturnal, ground-dwelling niche. They share few traits with other birds: they have small eyes, an elongated bill, and several features more characteristic of mammals. Early anatomical studies described a number of unique features in the kiwi brain, but their relevance to the behaviour and ecology of the species was not clearly established. This study aims to describe the structure of the primary cranial sensory systems of kiwi and comment on the evolutionary pressures that may have shaped their current form. The external morphology and relatively large size of the brain of kiwi, in particular those of the telencephalon, contrast with those of other Palaeognaths. The relative size of the cerebral hemispheres is rivalled only by a handful of parrots and songbirds. This enlargement results from a differential enlargement of the nidopallium, mesopallium and, to a lesser extent, of the basal ganglia. In other birds these regions are associated with the integration of information, cognition and learning. Kiwi brain centres processing visual information were small, although the retina structure showed an adaptation to dim light. The olfactory and trigeminal systems associated with the bill were hypertrophied. The auditory system shows specialisations associated with an overrepresentation of high frequency coding areas that originates in the cochlea and is preserved throughout the auditory brainstem. In absolute terms, the upper frequency response limit, based on hair cell morphology, is estimated to be about 5 kHz, the lower limit to be about 500 Hz, with a slightly higher frequency range predicted from the morphology of central auditory structures. The organisation of both nucleus angularis (NA) and nucleus laminaris (NL) in kiwi suggest that the central auditory system has retained the ancestral organisation except for the morphological features associated with the overrepresentation of high frequencies. Overall, the brain and sensory structures of kiwi have evolved neural adaptations that accompany the very different behavioural strategies associated with the unique niche the birds occupy. A large telencephalic size and shift away from vision towards an increased reliance on olfactory, tactile and auditory cues constitute a collection of features that make kiwi unique among birds. These findings provide a unique glimpse of the evolutionary history that has led to this unusual design, in particular, and challenge many of our current views about the evolution of brains and encephalisation, in general.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kiwi, brain.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5317</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transparencies: New Zealand from 1953 to 1974 through the slide photography of Gladys Cunningham</field><field name="creator">Benjamin, Julie Maree</field><field name="description">Transparencies: New Zealand from 1953 to 1974 through the Slide Photography of Gladys Cunningham This thesis focuses on the amateur slide photography of Gladys Cunningham, formerly of Onehunga, Auckland. Viewed collectively, these slides provide a visual autobiography of a New Zealand woman&#8217;s life, as well as a larger social narrative. As Gladys&#8217;s granddaughter, I argue that Gladys&#8217;s 35mm colour transparencies, nostalgic fragments that memorialise a family history, are informed by the social history of European New Zealanders between the early 1950s and early 1970s. Gladys&#8217;s slides reflect stabilities and changes for the photographer herself, her family and New Zealand society. While the term &#8220;transparency&#8221; suggests that the meaning of a slide can be understood by all, in reality further contextual information is necessary to appreciate the family and public histories from which these scenes have been separated. To situate Gladys&#8217;s slides, I refer to popular magazines and tourist texts from this period, including The Weekly News, National Geographic and New Zealand Holiday, and to commercial slides, postcards and travel marketing texts. I analyse the near absence of Maori within Gladys&#8217;s slides and travel journalism, suggesting that their omissions represent a lack of dialogue between Pakeha and Maori. In New Zealand and overseas, slide photography was the popular medium for recording extraordinary family events during the 1950 and 1960s. Through an analysis of memory, leisure and photography, this study examines how Gladys&#8217;s photography documents family and community membership and celebration. I explore how aesthetically pleasing representations of family leisure also contain partly concealed clues to less positive memories and to secrets that were not unique to this family. I discuss the impact of private and public transport on Gladys&#8217;s slide photography, noting how car travel facilitated spatial and temporal freedoms, and how slide photography strengthened connections to extended family and distant communities. In contrast, Gladys and Jim&#8217;s later dependence on coach transport enhanced their ability to take slides and expanded the &#8220;family&#8221; gaze of their camera, but limited their photographic opportunities.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand Social Life and customs</field><field name="subject">New Zealand Social Conditions</field><field name="subject">Travel photography</field><field name="subject">Landscape Photography new Zealand</field><field name="subject">Nostalgia</field><field name="subject">Autobiographical Memory</field><field name="subject">Photography of Families</field><field name="subject">Women New Zealand Auckland Biography</field><field name="subject">Photography Social Aspects New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Photography New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Camera Clubs</field><field name="subject">Visual Culture</field><field name="subject">Amateur Photography</field><field name="subject">Slides (Photography)</field><field name="subject">Women Photographers New Zealand Biography</field><field name="subject">Slides (Transparencies)</field><field name="subject">Tourism New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Leisure Social Aspects New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Community Life New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Family New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Photographic Society of New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Onehunga (Auckland NZ) History</field><field name="subject">Automobiles Social Aspects New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4964</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of the molecular complexes that regulate the G2/M checkpoint of the eukaryotic cell cycle</field><field name="creator">Collings, Melanie</field><field name="description">The cell cycle is one of the fundamental processes in nature, and is primarily concerned with the faithful replication of cellular contents, followed by even division to produce two identical daughter cells. It is made up of five discrete biochemical steps, comprising the interphase (G1, S and G2) and the mitotic phase (mitosis and cytokinesis), with two major regulatory checkpoints at G1 and G2. The focus of this research is the G2 checkpoint, which ensures the successful achievement of DNA replication, prior to the initiation of mitosis. Arrest or progression is principally mediated by the CDK1/cyclin B1 complex; phosphorylation of CDK1 by wee1 kinase prevents progression to mitosis, and subsequent dephosphorylation by the CDC25 phosphatases, initially the B isoform, leads to mitotic onset.  The aim of this research was the biophysical and/or biochemical characterisation of the molecular complexes that form at the G2 checkpoint to regulate entry into mitosis. CDK1 and cyclin B1 were separately expressed and purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. The wee1/14-3-3&#946; complex was also expressed and purified, incorporating either full length wee1 or a truncated version from which the N-terminal domain of wee1 was deleted. Both exhibited wee1 kinase activity, at equivalent levels, p&lt;0.001, with a 2.4 fold increase in kinase activity when wee1 is bound by 14-3-3&#946;, p&gt;0.001. Tryptic digestion of the complex indicated that its architecture was likely to be flexible and open, particularly within the N-terminal domain of wee1. CD analyses indicated that the wee1/14-3-3&#946; complex was folded, with 30-40% &#945;-helical content and 10-20% &#946;-sheet content. Dissociation experiments were unsuccessful, however, indicating a high strength of interaction between wee1 and 14-3-3&#946;. The empirical stoichiometry of the complex was determined as 1:1; subsequent native molecular weight determination suggested that the minimal functional unit is likely to be a 2:2 wee1/14-3-3&#946; arrangement. It was proposed that the structural architecture of this complex may be similar to the serotonin N-acetyltransferase/14-3-3&#950; complex. Experiments to determine the structure experimentally, using either TEM or x-ray crystallography, were unsuccessful, as the complex appeared to exhibit a high degree of flexibility in solution.  CDC25B was also expressed and purified, and was found to co-purify with a putative Sf9 14-3-3 protein. Consequently, it was re-cloned to co-express with 14-3-3&#946;, and subsequent analysis of the resulting CDC25B/14-3-3&#946; complex indicated that the empirical stoichiometry was 1:1, with the functional organization likely to be a 2:2 arrangement. It was proposed that the structural arrangement of this complex is most likely to be similar to that of the wee1/14-3-3&#946; complex.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5169</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Remembering the past, thinking of the present: Historic commemorations in New Zealand and Northern Ireland, 1940-1990</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Helen Alexandra</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses and compares two historic commemorations in Northern Ireland with two in New Zealand, in the period from 1940 to 1990. These commemorations are the Twelfth of July and Remembrance Sunday in Northern Ireland, and Waitangi Day and Anzac Day in New Zealand. Examination of these commemorations has revealed several patterns. In the commemorations studied in this thesis, levels of public adherence generally depended on the extent to which the values that the commemoration symbolised were seen as threatened or highly needed. The commemorations which reaffirmed compelling values tended to enjoy higher levels of public support than those expressing values which were seen as either unnecessary or unthreatened. In both countries, historic commemorations were capable of uniting communities behind core values. However, in cases where there was no general agreement on what those values were or what they meant, commemorations frequently became sites of division and conflict. All four commemorations were regularly used by organisers and participants to express views on contemporary political and social issues and, on several occasions in both countries, different groups battled for the control of particular commemorations. In both countries, increased levels of social conflict often led to the increased use of the past as a rhetorical device. The main conclusion to be drawn from this study is that these historic commemora&#172;tions derived more of their meaning from their contemporary context than from the historical events which they commemorated. In particular, how the public viewed and understood the values symbolised and reaffirmed by the commemorations strongly affected their levels of support. People were most likely to observe the commem-orations when they were seen as symbolising values which were widely adhered to and seen as threatened or urgently needed. The historic commemorations examined in this thesis were often strongly affected by contemporary events which were seen as relating, positively or negatively, to the values which the commemorations embodied.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Commemorations</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Northern Ireland</field><field name="subject">Waitangi Day</field><field name="subject">Anzac Day</field><field name="subject">Remembrance Sunday</field><field name="subject">Twelfth of July</field><field name="subject">Orange Order</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5380</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A "stupendous attraction" : materialising a Tibetan Buddhist contact zone in rural Australia</field><field name="creator">McAra, Sally, 1967-</field><field name="description">When people, ideas or things migrate across cultural milieux, many opportunities for cultural transformation arise. The focal point of this thesis is a large stupa/temple (Great Stupa) being built at Atisha Centre, a Buddhist retreat near Bendigo in Australia, by members of an international organisation called the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition (FPMT). I approach the planning, promotion and construction of the stupa as an instance of the transplantation of religious material culture, arguing that Atisha Centre and particularly the stupa play a constitutive role by acting as a contact zone (Pratt 1992). Since the Centre is a site of alternate social ordering in which the Buddhists attempt to actualise their universalist ideals in a specific place, I also conceptualise it as a heterotopia (Foucault 1986, Hetherington 1997). The contact zone entails engagement between different socio-cultural domains. One of the key domains is the globalisation of contemporary Buddhism and its permutations in new locales. Stemming from this is the question of how the Buddhists and their imported material culture engage with wider concerns such as various non-FPMT Buddhist, Anglo- Australian and Aboriginal locals&#8217; responses towards the transplantation of a Tibetan temple into a rural Australian locale. The complex and shifting relationships between different kinds of Buddhism feature in relation to different ideas about the value of holy objects. The FPMT conforms to the enlightenment-oriented ideals of &#8220;Buddhist modernism&#8221; (McMahan 2008) but appears to depart from it in its pronounced emphasis on merit-making and holy objects. However, the project&#8217;s proponents consider the stupa a method for enacting their enlightenment aspirations. I attribute the stupa project&#8217;s relatively smooth passage through local planning application procedures to proponents&#8217; prior social and cultural capital, which I link to positive public perceptions of Buddhism, aspirations for Bendigo to become more culturally diverse and the economic development the stupa is expected to bring. The literally concrete structure of the stupa not only provides Buddhists with a tangible focal point for their ideals, but also serves as a vehicle for the establishment of Tibetan Buddhism in a new land.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5234</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Broadband teleportation and entanglement in cascaded open quantum systems</field><field name="creator">Noh, Changsuk</field><field name="description">Quantum optics provides powerful means to probe quantum mechanics. In this thesis, we study various aspects of quantum phenomena arising in quantum optical systems. Part I studies broadband quantum teleportation. After presenting three different methods of analyzing the standard teleportation protocol, we study the interplay between various bandwidths in determining the fidelity of a broadband quantum field teleportation. Explicit formulae for the degrees of first- and secondorder coherence for the teleportation of resonance fluorescence are derived for this purpose. Part II studies entanglement arising in cascaded open quantum (optical) systems. First, a detailed laser model is produced within quantum trajectory theory to study the total decoherence rate of a laser-driven qubit. Second, using this model, we address the issue of laser quantum state, viewed in connection with separability of the laser-driven-qubit system. Third, a measure of entanglement within quantum trajectory theory called &#8216;Contextual Entanglement&#8217; is calculated for a few simple systems and compared with the &#8216;Entanglement of Formation&#8217;. Lastly, we introduce a method to quantify entanglement (based on the contextual entanglement) between a source and the field it emits, which we call the &#8216;Entanglement Spectrum&#8217;. It is applied to study the entanglement between a laser-driven qubit and the field the qubit scatters.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Quantum optics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5316</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of yeast genes involved in sauvignon blanc aroma development</field><field name="creator">Harsch, Michael Johannes</field><field name="description">The grape variety Sauvignon Blanc (SB) is the flagship of New Zealand&#8217;s wine industry and accounted for over 75 % of the value of total wine exports in 2008. Two volatile thiols, 3-mercaptohexan-1-ol (3MH) and 3-mercaptohexyl-acetate (3MHA), reminiscent of grapefruit and passion fruit respectively, are critical for the main varietal characters in New Zealand SB. These aromatic thiols are not present in the grape juice, but are synthesized and released by the yeast during alcoholic fermentation from non-aromatic precursors. The aim of this work was to elucidate the underlying genetics of volatile thiol synthesis in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) during alcoholic fermentation of grape juice. A gene-deletion strategy was chosen for the investigation of putative genes influencing 3MH and 3MHA release. The first part of this thesis optimized fermentation conditions in grape-juice-based media, which enabled auxotrophic laboratory strains, derived from S288C, to ferment grape juice to completion with high efficiency. Key steps to achieving this goal were the supplementation of the grape juice with higher than recommended amounts of amino acids, which increased the fermentation rate of auxotrophic yeast strains. Lysine auxotrophic strains especially benefited from this measure. In combination with the dilution of SB grape juice by 25 % with synthetic grape juice without sugars, the auxotrophic laboratory yeast BY4743 was able to metabolize all sugars in the grape juice-based media in a time frame similar to that of a commercial wine yeast. The key properties of the resulting wine were comparable to wine made with a commercial wine yeast under the same conditions. In the second part, these newly developed fermentation conditions were employed to screen 69 single-gene deletion strains in the laboratory yeast background BY4743. The list of the 69 candidate genes was compiled by combining existing knowledge about thiol production in yeast with the mining of several biological databases. Screening of the single-gene deletions revealed 17 genes which caused biologically relevant increases or decreases in volatile thiol production, but none abolished it. The majority of the 17 genes were related to the sulfur and nitrogen metabolism in yeast. A subset of these thiol-influencing genes were also deleted in a wine yeast, and were overexpressed in both wine yeast and laboratory yeast, to gain more insight in their regulatory effects. The findings confirmed that sulfur and nitrogen metabolism in yeast were important in regulating 3MH and 3MHA synthesis. Different sulfur and nitrogen sources were added to the grape must prior to fermentation and their effect on thiol release was studied. It was found that nitrogen sources urea and DAP, as well as, the sulfur compound S-ethyl-L-cysteine (SEC) increased 3MH and 3MHA concentrations in the resulting wines. The addition of cysteine to grape juice fermented with wine yeast deleted in genes CYS3 and CYS4 more than doubled total thiol production. Mapping approaches to investigate thiol production in yeast were employed in the final part of this thesis. Genetically mapped F2 progeny of a cross between a low thiol-producing yeast strain and a high-thiol producer were screened for their thiol phenotype. The 3MH and 3MHA phenotypes across 48 screened F2 progeny resembled normal distributions, indicating a quantitative trait. Subsequent mapping identified a locus on chromosome 14 with a small effect on the 3MHA phenotype, but no obvious candidate genes were evident in the region. Another approach to investigate the evolution of volatile thiols in yeast included the use of SEC, a thiol compound resembling the cysteinylated precursor of 3MH, as a sole nitrogen source in a yeast growth assay. It was found that most wine yeast, European yeast isolates and laboratory yeasts could utilize SEC as a nitrogen source, whereas various other S. cerevisiae isolates could not. Crosses between three pairs of Sec- and Sec+ yeast strains strongly indicated that this trait was monogenically inherited. However, no direct correlation between the SEC phenotype and volatile release could be observed. Genetic mapping experiments in one SEC-segregating yeast population linked this SEC phenotype to the leu2-D0 deletion in a cross between a Leu+ and Leu- yeast strain. It was shown that leucine auxotrophy most likely caused the Sec- phenotype. In a second F2 population of a cross between prototrophic Sec+ and Sec- strains, strong linkage was established to a region on chromosome 6 containing two candidate genes, DUG1 and IRC7. DUG1 was proved not to be the cause of the SEC phenotype, whereas IRC7 remains a strong candidate gene.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">volatile thiols</field><field name="subject">Sauvignon Blanc</field><field name="subject">aroma</field><field name="subject">genes</field><field name="subject">3-mercaptohexan-1-ol</field><field name="subject">3-mercaptohexyl-acetate</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5293</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Knots and quandles</field><field name="creator">Budden, Stephen Mark</field><field name="description">Quandles were introduced to Knot Theory in the 1980s as an almost complete algebraic invariant for knots and links. Like their more basic siblings, groups, they are difficult to distinguish so a major challenge is to devise means for determining when two quandles having different presentations are really different. This thesis addresses this point by studying algebraic aspects of quandles.  Following what is mainly a recapitulation of existing work on quandles, we firstly investigate how a link quandle is related to the quandles of the individual components of the link. Next we investigate coset quandles. These are motivated by the transitive action of the operator, associated and automorphism group actions on a given quandle, allowing techniques of permutation group theory to be used. We will show that the class of all coset quandles includes the class of all Alexander quandles; indeed all group quandles.  Coset quandles are used in two ways: to give representations of connected quandles, which include knot quandles; and to provide target quandles for homomorphism invariants which may be useful in enabling one to distinguish quandles by counting homomorphisms onto target quandles.  Following an investigation of the information loss in going from the fundamental quandle of a link to the fundamental group, we apply our techniques to calculations for the figure eight knot and braid index two knots and involving lower triangular matrix groups.  The thesis is rounded out by two appendices, one giving a short table of  knot quandles for knots up to six crossings and the other a computer program for computing the homomorphism invariants.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">knot theory</field><field name="subject">quandles</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5292</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pressure assisted thermal sterilization: a novel means of processing foods</field><field name="creator">Wimalaratne, Sajith Kanchana</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates a newly developed and patented technology for its ability to inactivate spore- forming bacteria and non-spore-forming microorganisms. This new technology &#8220;Pressure Assisted Thermal Sterilization&#169;&#8221; (PATS) is based on the theory of the thermal expansion of liquids. The efficiency of inactivating spore-forming and non-spore-forming microorganisms by PATS was compared with the thermal treatment alone. A combination treatment consisting of high pressure processing and gaseous carbon dioxide was also investigated for its ability to inactivate bacterial spores in model and real food matrices. The structural damage caused by treatments to the spores and non-spore-forming bacteria was assessed by scanning electron microscopy.  Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores suspended in Milli-Q water, UHT milk and pumpkin soup, treated by PATS were found to have significantly lower decimal reduction times (D values) compared with the thermal treatment alone. Spores suspended in UHT milk were more heat resistant compared with those in Milli-Q water and pumpkin soup. Bacillus cereus spores suspended in Milli-Q water and pumpkin soup treated with PATS were more effectively inactivated compared with spores treated by the thermal treatment alone. Clostridium botulinum spores in saline buffer subjected to PATS treatment were inactivated more effectively compared with the thermal treatment alone. Overall, the results show that PATS was a better processing technique for inactivation of bacterial spores compared with thermal treatment alone. However, PATS had no added benefit in inactivating the non-spore-forming bacteria Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells compared with the thermal treatment. A shelf life study showed that B. cereus spores in pumpkin soup retained a low spore count (&lt;5 LogCFU/mL) for approximately 40 days in 30oC storage after treatment with PATS. No additional degradation of colour pigments of pumpkin soup and model pumpkin juice was observed following PATS compared with the thermal treatment. Spore-forming microorganisms can be resistant to pressure treatment alone, which limits the application of high pressure processing (HPP). Therefore, a combination approach was investigated. The mechanism of inactivating spores by combining HPP with other treatments is that the pressure assists in spore germination. Then a secondary treatment (thermal or CO2 gas) can be used to inactivate the germinated spores. A combined application of HPP and a consecutive CO2 treatment was investigated for the efficiency of spore inactivation. Results showed that HPP (200 MPa for 30 min) followed by a CO2 treatment inactivated Bacillus subtilis 168 in nutrient broth, tomato juice and liquid whole egg by 2.5, 1.0 and 1.5 LogCFU/mL respectively. These results indicated that this technique is inadequate for practical use. Scanning electron micrographs showed that pressure processing of B. subtilis 168 and B. subtilis natto spores resulted in deformation of the spore structure. This structural deformation of spores may have been due to water absorption during HPP and subsequent release upon decompression. PATS treated G. stearothermophilus and B. cereus spores were more severely damaged compared with the same spores which underwent thermal treatment alone. However, the extent to which E. coli and S. cerevisiae cells were damaged by both PATS and thermal treatment was similar.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">High Pressure Processing</field><field name="subject">Pressure Assisted Thermal Sterilization</field><field name="subject">Food Processing</field><field name="subject">Novel Food Processing Technologies</field><field name="subject">Combined High Pressure Processing and Carbon Dioxide Treatment</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5294</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An unblinking gaze: on the philosophy of the Marquis de Sade</field><field name="creator">Roche, Geoffrey T.</field><field name="description">Throughout the 20th Century, a number of philosophers, writers, artists and film makers have implied that there is some profound significance to the work of Donatien Alphonse Fran&#231;ois, the Marquis de Sade (1740-1814).

Firstly, I will consider the various philosophical interpretations of Sade&#8217;s work.

RESOURCEFULNESS IN NEW ZEALAND</field><field name="creator">Meldrum, Raymond John</field><field name="description">This thesis asks: &#145;How can tertiary education nurture entrepreneurial creativity?&#146; Entrepreneurship is considered to be a vital determinant of economic growth and the entrepreneur is understood as someone who innovates and commercialises their own innovation. The setting is New Zealand which is struggling to make the shift from relying on primary production to becoming a &#145;creative economy.&#146; 

The creative individual has been identified as a new mainstream but it is argued that in New Zealand, education provision is inadequate for supporting the development of the practice of entrepreneurship. The problem is not unique. Various writers are critical of business education generally, and of the mismatch between the passion and chaos in entrepreneurs&#146; lives and the way education programs are typically organised as a linear sequence of discipline-based courses with prescribed content, activities and outcomes. 

Rich data were gathered from in-depth interviews with twelve nascent, new or experienced entrepreneurs and two associates (one a marketer, the other a scientist). Each participant was drawn from a different area of economic endeavour. They were asked to share their stories and views about creativity, the connections between creativity and entrepreneurship, business success, formal and informal education, and ways to improve tertiary education programs.  

The research found that a suitable environment for nurturing creativity will most likely have structure but will also enable chaos. It will present opportunities for experiencing diversity, and will stimulate unconscious and conscious mental processes. It will provide scope for hard work that is fun and involves authentic risk-taking, and will enable both individual and purposeful teamwork. The study also found that business success is not based on knowledge but is rather about being resourceful. The becoming of the creative entrepreneur thus includes developing capability to network with peers and mentors and communicate with customers and staff, and developing passion for and resilience in the pursuit of a dream. 
 
The findings suggest that in an age of uncertainty, nurturing entrepreneurial creativity and resourcefulness requires learning to be viewed as a practice-based community process where knowing and doing are interwoven with being. It is argued that this needs to align with Ronald Barnett and Kelly Coate&#146;s (2005) notion of &#145;a curriculum for engagement.&#146; It is suggested that an entire program might simply invite students to work collaboratively to identify and exploit an entrepreneurial opportunity by producing and commercialising an appropriate product/service innovation; to undertake this work as two separate projects &#150; one within an existing organisation, and the other as a new venture; and to theorise their work. It is proposed that a suitable framework lies in William Doll&#146;s (2002) advocacy for a curriculum based on a matrix of five Cs: &#145;currere,&#146; complexity, cosmology, conversation, and community. To these, creativity is added as a sixth C.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">curriculum</field><field name="subject">creativity</field><field name="subject">entrepreneur</field><field name="subject">creative economy</field><field name="subject">tertiary education</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20091004.182043</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vulnerability to bushfires in south-eastern Australia: a case study from East Gippsland, Victoria.</field><field name="creator">Whittaker, William Joshua</field><field name="description">This thesis is an analysis of human vulnerability to bushfires in the Wulgulmerang district of East   Gippsland, Victoria, in south-eastern Australia.

Australian bushfire research has traditionally focused on the geophysical dimensions of fire hazards and disasters, with little consideration of how cultural, economic, political and social factors   shape people's exposure to hazards and their capacities to cope and adapt to bushfire impacts. To date, there have been no systematic, social science analyses of human vulnerability to bushfires.      The vulnerability analysis presented in this thesis concentrates on two key research questions: (1) How and why were people exposed to hazards during the bushfires? and (2) How and why were people differentially capable of coping and adapting to the fires' impacts? Qualitative methods were primarily used to investigate these questions, including semi-structured interviews with residents and landholders of the Wulgulmerang district, representatives of government departments and authorities, and others who participated in responses to the fires.      The thesis develops a multifaceted understanding of how and why people were vulnerable to the   January 30 fires. Vulnerability is shown to arise from the circumstances of people's day to day lives, which are shaped by factors both within and beyond their control. Local pressures and challenges - such as drought, declining farm incomes, depopulation, limited access to essential services, and political marginality - are shown to increase people's exposure to bushfire hazards and reduce their capacities to cope and adapt. The thesis demonstrates the fundamental importance of sustainable   livelihoods and regional economic and social vitality to the long-term goal of vulnerability reduction.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bushfire vulnerability</field><field name="subject">Wulgulmerang</field><field name="subject">cultural</field><field name="subject">economic</field><field name="subject">political and social factors</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090401.122025</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The measurement of the performance of New Zealand tertiary education institutions and the demand for their services</field><field name="creator">Smart, Warren</field><field name="description">This thesis explored the measurement of performance of New Zealand tertiary education institutions (TEIs) and the demand for their services. This involved analysing the research performance of New Zealand universities, analysing the productive efficiency of New Zealand TEIs and examining the choice of provider by bachelor&#8217;s degree starters. Bibliometric data was used to measure the research productivity of New Zealand universities. This showed that following a fall during the early 2000s, the research productivity of New Zealand universities increased following the introduction of the Performance-Based Research Fund (PBRF). A multi-dimensional analysis of university research performance between 2000 and 2005 showed that no individual university was top in all four of the performance measures assessed. The overall performance of three universities, Massey University, Lincoln University and Auckland University of Technology, were noticeably below that of the other five universities. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was then applied to input and output data of New Zealand TEIs to analyse their productive efficiency. In 2006, polytechnics that had: low levels of bachelor&#8217;s degree provision, were not regionally based, had a high proportion of subcontracting and were larger institutions, achieved higher levels of pure technical efficiency. The analysis showed that several polytechnics could improve their technical efficiency by reducing their scale of operations. In polytechnics, higher technical efficiency was associated with better financial performance. A number of technically efficient polytechnics struggled financially, indicating that the overall efficiency of the polytechnic sector was not high, or the funding model they operate under is not appropriate. The analysis also showed that decreasing bachelor&#8217;s degree provision, poor financial performance in the previous year, an increase in provision of community education, was associated with higher growth in total factor productivity between 1996 and 2006. The application of DEA to Australasian university data between 1997 and 2005 showed that New Zealand universities performed relatively well in terms of relative pure technical efficiency, compared with their Australian counterparts. However, the total factor productivity of New Zealand universities increased at a lower rate, on average, than that of the Australian Group of Eight and newer Australian universities. The application of DEA to a dataset of the participating TEIs in the PBRF showed that polytechnics had lower technical efficiency, on average, than other TEIs. The choices of bachelor&#8217;s degree starters in 2006 were analysed for evidence of a lack of parity of esteem between university and polytechnic degrees. The results showed that a lack of parity of esteem between polytechnic and university degrees may be influencing student choices. Students from higher deciles schools, with higher secondary school qualifications, Asians, students who travel for study, were all more likely to enrol in a university to start a bachelor&#8217;s degree. There was less clear cut evidence of a lack of parity of esteem between selected groupings of New Zealand universities. However, there did appear to be a lack of parity of esteem between the four older metropolitan universities and the two newest universities, with signs the former were held in higher esteem.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tertiary education institutions</field><field name="subject">Research productivity</field><field name="subject">Data envelopment analysis</field><field name="subject">Technical efficiency</field><field name="subject">Total factor productivity</field><field name="subject">Parity of esteem</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/761</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Natal dispersal, habitat selection and mortality of North Island Brown Kiwi (Apteryx mantelli) at the Moehau Kiwi Sanctuary, Coromandel</field><field name="creator">Forbes, Yuri</field><field name="description">The Moehau Kiwi Sanctuary is one of five sanctuaries established in 2000 and managed by the Department of Conservation. The objective of the sanctuaries is to protect the most endangered kiwi taxa, and increase kiwi survivorship. Operation Nest Egg (ONE) is a programme utilised by the Moehau Kiwi Sanctuary for artificially incubating abandoned Kiwi eggs and captive rearing chicks until they begin to show a gain in weight. ONE chicks were then released back onto Moehau or adjacent protected areas.  Kiwi populations are declining on the mainland at an average of about 3% per year in areas where predators of kiwi are not controlled. The main cause for this decline is chick mortality due to predation by stoats (Mustela erminea). During natal dispersal kiwi are known to disperse significant distances of between 5&#8211;20 km, and this has influenced the size of management areas needed for the protection of kiwi (10,000 hectares). The type of forest-cover is an important element in determining where management areas are located, as kiwi has preferences for certain forest types over others. This study conducted at Moehau, Coromandel, on the North Island Brown Kiwi advances our knowledge of kiwi by examining differences in rates and distances of dispersal among chicks, sub-adults, non-territorial and territorial adults, as well as between genders. This study investigates kiwi selective use of roost site types, ground-cover types, forest types and physiographical features. Addressed in this study are differences in dispersal, habitat selection and mortality among age-classes and between genders over the months of the year, and across elevations. Comparisons between ONE and wild-reared kiwi dispersal and mortality are included. Data were collected between 2001 and 2008 from observations of kiwi located during daytime hours. The data recorded included the grid reference, elevation, ground-cover type, forest type, physiography, and the type of roost site. The sample size for this study was significantly larger than for any previous studies thus enabling a greater confidence in estimated dispersal rates and dispersal distances, habitat selection and factors relating to mortality. All wild-reared kiwi displayed dispersal and were not philopatric to their natal area. Dispersal distances were found to be further than previously estimated, with the net distance of natal dispersal differing among age-classes, from an average of 834m (SE +/- 131) for kiwi chicks to 7,553m (SE = +/- 1167) for non-territorial adults. Female sub-adult kiwi dispersed further (7,215m) than male sub-adult kiwi (4,226m) (p = 0.04). The time taken to travel one km during natal dispersal ranged from an average of 131days/km (SE = +/- 9) for chicks to 89 days/km (SE = +/- 13) for sub-adults. Habitat selection has been observed in other studies on kiwi but not specifically for Coromandel North Island Brown Kiwi, and selection for ground-cover types by kiwi when roosting on the surface has never been previously studied. Roost site selection of kiwi differed among age-classes (p &lt;0.001), between gender (p &lt;0.001), and across elevations (p &lt;0.001). Female kiwi were found more often in surface roosts (64%) than hole roosts (32%), and male kiwi were found at similar frequencies in holes (46%) and on the surface (47%). Sub-adults used holes to a greater extent as elevation increased, and selected for sub-alpine forest over broadleaf forest (p &lt;0.001). This study is the first to recognise that selection of ground-cover types by kiwi differs among age-classes (p &lt;0.001). Kiwi chicks were more often found on the surface under dead fern fronds and debris (39%) than other ground-cover types. The mortality rate was highest in chicks (33%), with predation responsible for 60% of these deaths; conservation management techniques were responsible for a further 20% of deaths; the remaining 20% of deaths were due to natural or unknown causes. Summer (December-February) was the season in which 81% of kiwi chick deaths occurred. The high proportion of deaths from monitoring techniques and the use of radio-transmitters (22%) indicates improvements need to be made to current management practices. ONE chicks were found to disperse shorter distances and had a greater mortality rate than wild-reared chicks. Therefore, recommendations are made for changes to ONE management practices. Further recommendations are made for the enhancement of kiwi habitat that could reduce kiwi mortality, and for increasing the habitat available to kiwi, thereby potentially increasing population sizes and/or densities.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Apteryx</field><field name="subject">Dispersal</field><field name="subject">Habitat selection</field><field name="subject">Mortality</field><field name="subject">Kiwi</field><field name="subject">Moehau</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/762</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation into the Accuracy of Single Frequency Precise Point Positioning (PPP)</field><field name="creator">Choy, Sue Lynn</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the major errors and processes affecting the performance of a viable, standalone point positioning technique known as single frequency Precise Point Positioning (PPP).

The meaning of LIFE has been redefined by a new landscape language. Living, infrastructure, traffic, shopping and eating identify the most common scenarios that are an intrinsic part of our daily lives. These are not exempt from the problems and difficulties characteristic of large cities like Shanghai. Landscape no longer focuses only on building parks or squares. In my project it has its own definition that informs about how to create a sustainable space not only for public use but also for private use.   The research into the different ways people live has assisted me in identifying the Longtang morphology -a living system that was very popular and successful in downtown Shanghai in the 30's. Longtang is a fast-disappearing architecture due to the urban expansion in older Shanghai. Nowadays people's living conditions have improved. The buildings are new and mostly high-rise, without the unique Longtang style- easy eating and shopping &#168;C in the past and without the good neighborhood relationships and useful public space. However, Longtang's living style to some extent surpasses the modern high-rise living structure. This research acknowledges the success of LIFE as a balanced schema in Longtang.   The space in a traditional Longtang is neither public nor private. Longtang residents concede and build on its spatial negotiations, as private space is very restricted. Transferring private space into public space is one of the most important rules people learn while living in the Longtang. And my research question concerning how Longtang urban morphology can be used as a tool in the development of Shanghai becomes my key point in studying the Longtang structure, especially the changeability of the Longtang space.   The research also identified a need for public space in various scales. The provision of this space is not easy as Shanghai is a highly dense area. My project proposes the use of public space as private-testing the strategy at different scales.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">landscape architecture</field><field name="subject">Longtang</field><field name="subject">public space</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091105.123653</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Layered Surface Acoustic Wave Based Gas Sensors Utilising Nanostructured Indium Oxide Thin Layer</field><field name="creator">Fechete, Alexandru Constantin</field><field name="description">Planar two-dimensional (2-D) nanostructured indium oxide (InOx) and one-dimensional (1-D) tin oxide (SnO2) semiconductor metal-oxide layers have been utilised for gas sensing applications. Novel layered Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) based sensors were developed consisting of InOx/SiOxNy/36&#176;YXLiTaO3, InOx/SiNx/SiO2/36&#176;YXLiTaO3 and InOx/SiNx/36&#176;YXLiTaO3 The 1 &#181;m intermediate layers of silicon oxynitride (SiOxNy), silicon nitride (SiNx) and SiO2/SiNx matrix were deposited on lithium tantalate (36&#176;YXLiTaO3) substrates by r.f. magnetron sputtering, electron-beam evaporation and plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) techniques, respectively. As a gas sensitive layer, a 100 nm thin layer of InOx was deposited on the intermediate layers by r.f. magnetron sputtering. The targeted gases were ozone (O3) and hydrogen (H2). An intermediate layer has multiple functions: protective role for the interdigital transducers' electrodes as well as an isolating effect from  InOx sensing layer, thereby improving the sensor performance. The developed SAW sensors' exhibited high response magnitudes with repeatable, reversible and stable responses towards O3 and H2. They are capable of sensing concentrations as low as 20 parts-per-billion for O3 and 600 parts-per-million for H2. Additionally a conductometric type novel sensing structure of            SnO2/36&#176;YX LiTaO3 was also developed by depositing a thin layer of SnO2 nanorods by PECVD. The gas sensing performance exhibited repeatable, reversible, stable responses towards NO2 and CO. The surface morphology, crystalline structure and preferred orientation of the deposited layers were investigated by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD). A polycrystalline, oxygen deficient non-stoichiometric InOx with grain sizes of 20-40 nm was revealed. The                     1-D nanostructures were characterised by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) showing nanorods with needle-like shape , diameters of 10-20 nm a t the top and     30-40 nm at the base as well as a  preferential growth orientation of [ ] on the LiTaO3 substrate.

To date, little effort has been dedicated to considering how the structural properties of coupling and cohesion may impact on the maintainability of SO software products. Moreover, due to the unique design characteristics of Service-Oriented Computing (SOC), existing Procedural and Object-Oriented (OO) software metrics are not sufficient for the accurate measurement of service-oriented design structures.      This thesis makes a contribution to the field of SOC, and Software Engineering in general, by proposing and evaluating a suite of design-level coupling and cohesion metrics for predicting the maintainability of service-oriented software products early in the Software Development LifeCycle (SDLC). The proposed metrics can provide the following benefits: i) facilitate design decisions that could lead to the specification of quality SO designs that can be maintained more easily; ii) identify design problems that can potentially have a negative effect on the maintainability of existing service-oriented design structures; and iii) support more effective control of maintainability in the earlier stages of SDLC.      More specifically, the following research was conducted as part of this thesis:   -	A formal mathematical model covering the structural and behavioural properties of service-oriented system design was specified.    -	Software metrics were defined in a precise, unambiguous, and formal manner using the above model.   -	The metrics were theoretically validated and empirically evaluated in order to determine the success of this thesis as follows:   a.	Theoretical validation was based on the property-based software engineering measurement framework. All the proposed metrics were deemed as theoretically valid.   b.	Empirical evaluation employed a controlled experimental study involving ten participants who performed a range of maintenance tasks on two SO systems developed (and measured using the proposed metrics) specifically for this study. The majority of the experimental outcomes compared favourably with our expectations and hypotheses. More specifically, the results indicated that most of the proposed metrics can be used to predict the maintainability of service-oriented software products early in the SDLC, thereby providing evidence for the validity and potential usefulness of the derived metrics. Nevertheless, a broader range of industrial scale experiments and analyses are required to fully demonstrate the practical applicability of the metrics. This has been left to future work.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Service-Oriented Computing (SOC)</field><field name="subject">Maintainability</field><field name="subject">Software design metrics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091105.144445</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of the Atlantic Corridor Project as a Form of Strategic Community of Practice in Facilitating Business Transformations in Latin America.</field><field name="creator">Arroyo, Alejandro C.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the way a change management entity facilitated a deep and lasting business transformation, undertaken as a major program of projects that were engaged in business process re-engineering, logistics supply change management and formation of joint ventures and forms of alliance.

This thesis uses the framework of social work supervision, as defined by Kadushin (1985; 2002), with the administrative, educative and supportive elements. The research focuses closely on the latter two elements. For this purpose, I employ qualitative research methods, via a triangulation of methods, being guided by Participatory Action Research (PAR) and then conducting semi-structured interviews and focus groups as well as acting as a participant observer, to gather the data. The data was analysed using grounded theory.      This research was based upon a clinical supervision project that was fully funded and provided free clinical supervision by external supervisors, providing both individual and group supervision, for a period of 10 months. There were a total of 16 respondents with varied roles and training backgrounds as well as an additional six supervisors, interviewed throughout different stages of the project. The various roles undertaken by me throughout the research process provided essential viewpoints on supervision, as well as the place of boundaries and need for support. The power of such a large scale intervention is discussed and ultimately highlights and identifies the particular benefits of supervision in this research arena.        This thesis places clinical supervision in the context of workforce development in the Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) sector. Thus, while this research elucidates a number of benefits and the factors involved with this experience, the clear separation of other modalities such as training, mentoring and Critical Incident debriefing are seen as integral additional avenues of support and professional development. This research concludes also with what the difficulties and hindrances were for people to continue with regular ongoing clinical supervision, and warrants the argument for interminable supervision in this setting.      This research points to an overall paucity of literature on efficacy studies, especially in the AOD context in Australia. This research significantly adds to this dearth and examines the factors unique to the AOD sector in Australia, as well as what factors make for effective supervision. The particular impact of external supervisors and group supervision are explored, which underwrites the forwarded concept of a customised supervision for this setting. By making explicit in this research what the efficacy is on those new to supervision, it provides greater clarity for future studies.      A number of recommendations are proposed as result of this research. New definitions of the supportive function of supervision and of clinical supervision are forwarded, as is a new look at the evolving history of social work supervision. This thesis highlights the impact of external supervisors and the unique contribution they offer.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Clinical supervision</field><field name="subject">supervision</field><field name="subject">participatory action research</field><field name="subject">grounded theory</field><field name="subject">social work supervision</field><field name="subject">social work</field><field name="subject">supportive supervision</field><field name="subject">external supervision</field><field name="subject">external supervisors</field><field name="subject">alcohol and other drug sector</field><field name="subject">role triangulation</field><field name="subject">ethnography</field><field name="subject">group supervision</field><field name="subject">workforce development</field><field name="subject">customised supervision</field><field name="subject">social work history</field><field name="subject">professional supervision</field><field name="subject">critical incident debriefing</field><field name="subject">alcohol and other drugs</field><field name="subject">supervision impact</field><field name="subject">effective supervision</field><field name="subject">supervision effectiveness</field><field name="subject">efficacy of supervision</field><field name="subject">nursing supervision</field><field name="subject">psychological supervision</field><field name="subject">participatory action research</field><field name="subject">action research</field><field name="subject">PAR</field><field name="subject">participant observer</field><field name="subject">supervision in Australia</field><field name="subject">Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091106.113121</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gleaning potential: practicing design practice through material expression.</field><field name="creator">Lloyd, Simon</field><field name="description">This research project examines the potential of gleaned material fragments to inform a practice of designing artefacts for production.

These factors in turn affect the viability of many small-to-medium sized enterprises (SMEs), which are the primary employers and the engines for economic growth and employment in rural districts.  The combined effect of these processes is that many rural districts struggle to keep young people, maintain economic and social diversity and attract new settlers and investment. This thesis seeks to answer the question as to how large scale retail businesses, rural farm amalgamations and declining rural populations impact on the viability of SME retail businesses in rural areas.  In order to answer this question, this study identifies   the key factors, which affect the future viability of small-to-medium sized retail businesses in sparsely populated rural districts using the South Taranaki District as a case study.  The role of economic development agencies and district councils is also examined using case studies of small towns in rural districts of Australia and the United States of America (USA).    This study found a number of factors affect the future viability of small-to-medium sized retail businesses in sparsely populated rural districts. For the South Taranaki district, these factors include the arrival of large-scale supermarkets, followed by large scale retail chains such as The Warehouse.  These factors, combined with changing rural population structures and economic &#8216;spikes&#8217; relating to sporadic energy development, have significant implications for the long term viability of many SMEs in the district. Case studies of similar rural districts in the USA and Australia provided examples of strategies that could be used to manage these impacts.  This thesis recommends policies, initiatives and strategies that may be considered by territorial local authorities, regional councils and central governments to help address the economic development challenges facing rural districts.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Retail convergence</field><field name="subject">Big box retailers</field><field name="subject">Case study South Taranaki</field><field name="subject">Rural depopulation</field><field name="subject">Economic development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/763</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolving connectionist systems for adaptive decision support with application in ecological data modelling</field><field name="creator">Soltic, Snjezana</field><field name="description">Ecological modelling problems have characteristics both featured in other modelling fields and specific ones, hence, methods developed and tested in other research areas may not be suitable for modelling ecological problems or may perform poorly when used on ecological data. This thesis identifies issues associated with the techniques typically used for solving ecological problems and develops new generic methods for decision support, especially suitable for ecological data modelling, which are characterised by: (1) adaptive learning, (2) knowledge discovery and (3) accurate prediction. These new methods have been successfully applied to challenging real world ecological problems. Despite the fact that the number of possible applications of computational intelligence methods in ecology is vast, this thesis primarily concentrates on two problems: (1) species establishment prediction and (2) environmental monitoring. Our review of recent papers suggests that multi-layer perceptron networks trained using the backpropagation algorithm are most widely used of all artificial neural networks for forecasting pest insect invasions. While the multi-layer perceptron networks are appropriate for modelling complex nonlinear relationships, they have rather limited exploratory capabilities and are difficult to adapt to dynamically changing data. In this thesis an approach that addresses these limitations is proposed. We found that environmental monitoring applications could benefit from having an intelligent taste recognition system possibly embedded in an autonomous robot. Hence, this thesis reviews the current knowledge on taste recognition and proposes a biologically inspired artificial model of taste recognition based on biologically plausible spiking neurons. The model is dynamic and is capable of learning new tastants as they become available. Furthermore, the model builds a knowledge base that can be extracted during or after the learning process in form of IF-THEN fuzzy rules. It also comprises a layer that simulates the influence of taste receptor cells on the activity of their adjacent cells. These features increase the biological relevance of the model compared to other current taste recognition models. The proposed model was implemented in software on a single personal computer and in hardware on an Altera FPGA chip. Both implementations were applied to two real-world taste datasets.In addition, for the first time the applicability of transductive reasoning for forecasting the establishment potential of pest insects into new locations was investigated. For this purpose four types of predictive models, built using inductive and transductive reasoning, were used for predicting the distributions of three pest insects. The models were evaluated in terms of their predictive accuracy and their ability to discover patterns in the modelling data. The results obtained indicate that evolving connectionist systems can be successfully used for building predictive distribution models and environmental monitoring systems. The features available in the proposed dynamic systems, such as on-line learning and knowledge discovery, are needed to improve our knowledge of the species distributions.

It also evaluates whether attitudinal changes are enduring and therefore continue to influence students&#8217; responses to the disabled after a period of time has elapsed. Respondents were students on the Diploma of Hospitality Management at Auckland University of Technology (AUT), enrolled on an Accommodation Operations paper. A compulsory assessment for this paper was a group assignment that considered facilities offered by accommodation providers for guests with disabilities. Respondents were surveyed before (n = 54) and after (n = 24) the assignment to determine any attitude and knowledge changes. Both surveys were undertaken at the end of lectures. The surveys were distributed in class, so the number of respondents relates to the number of students in class during the particular lecture selected for survey distribution. Respondents were then invited to join a focus group to explore their feelings and opinions about disabled people. Another focus group was undertaken with students who had completed the disability assignment the previous year. The focus group was to assess whether or not the awareness of disability issues was still apparent after a period of time had elapsed. These findings would then prove whether or not exposure to such issues still influenced respondents&#8217; attitudes. The second survey responses and comments made during the subsequent focus groups conclude that awareness of disability issues may be heightened with exposure to barriers, both physical and attitudinal, that are experienced by people with impairments. Understanding of disability issues is the first step in the removal of barriers and will help lead to the creation of a more inclusive environment for staff and guests in the hospitality industry. An inclusive environment is particularly desirable as more hotels are required in response to increases in tourist numbers. With increased visitors&#8217; arrivals, it is reasonable to expect that tourists will have varying abilities, and therefore, modification of facilities to suit their needs will benefit a large number of people. The research also concludes that the knowledge gained in the assignment was still influential after the conclusion of the assignment. Students who have studied issues for people with impairments, as future managers, will have the knowledge and understanding to provide a more inclusive environment for guests that meets both social and legal obligations. Such an environment will be beneficial to both guests and potential employees with physical disabilities.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Disabilities</field><field name="subject">Attitudes</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Attitudinal barriers</field><field name="subject">Disability awareness</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/747</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrated feature, neighbourhood, and model optimization for personalised modelling and knowledge discovery</field><field name="creator">Liang, Wen</field><field name="description">&#8220;Machine learning is the process of discovering and interpreting meaningful information, such as new correlations, patterns and trends by sifting through large amounts of data stored in repositories, using pattern recognition technologies as well as statistical and mathematical techniques&#8221;  (Larose, 2005).  From my understanding, machine learning is a process of using different analysis techniques to observe previously unknown, potentially meaningful information, and discover strong patterns and relationships from a large dataset.  Professor Kasabov (2007b) classified computational models into three categories (e.g. global, local, and personalised) which have been widespread and used in the areas of data analysis and decision support in general, and in the areas of medicine and bioinformatics in particular.  Most recently, the concept of personalised modelling has been widely applied to various disciplines such as personalised medicine, personalised drug design for known diseases (e.g. cancer, diabetes, brain disease, etc.) as well as for other modelling problems in ecology, business, finance, crime prevention, and so on.  The philosophy behind the personalised modelling approach is that every person is different from others, thus he/she will benefit from having a personalised model and treatment.  However, personalised modelling is not without issues, such as defining the correct number of neighbours or defining an appropriate number of features.  As a result, the principal goal of this research is to study and address these issues and to create a novel framework and system for personalised modelling.  The framework would allow users to select and optimise the most important features and nearest neighbours for a new input sample in relation to a certain problem based on a weighted variable distance measure in order to obtain more precise prognostic accuracy and personalised knowledge, when compared with global modelling and local modelling approaches.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Personalised modelling</field><field name="subject">Feature selection</field><field name="subject">Nearest neighbour</field><field name="subject">Model optimization</field><field name="subject">Optimisation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/749</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Roles and impacts of accounting and auditing organization for Islamic financial institutions (AAOIFI) in dealing with the accounting and disclosure of Zakah and Interest (Riba)</field><field name="creator">Ahmad Nadzri, Farah Aida</field><field name="description">The issues of zakah and interest for IFIs have been highlighted for several years and attracted many arguments among Islamic scholars and public. The increasing public interest on the Islamic Banking since 1970s has been driven by the increasing sensitivity among Muslims to the relationship between religion and economic activities. With the emergence of IFIs, Muslims community has demanded for an establishment of an accounting body to develop a set of accounting standards that adhere to the Islamic tenets, hence AAOIFI was established. However, the journey of AAOFI in achieving such objective has not been smooth. This paper intended to study the effectiveness of AAOIFI in dealing with the issues of zakah and riba for IFIs by examining the disclosure practice of 25 IFIs worldwide.  Based on the analysis conducted, it is concluded that the extents of disclosure by the IFIs are much lower than the AAOIFI requirements. The study also found that leverage and origin factors might contribute to the level disclosures of zakah and financial products. In addition, the test performed also revealed that the adopters of AAOIFI do provide more disclosure as compared to the non-adopters. However, the mean result is relatively low to suggest full compliance with the AAOIFI standards.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Islamic accounting standards</field><field name="subject">Riba</field><field name="subject">Zakah</field><field name="subject">Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI)</field><field name="subject">Content analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/754</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The acquisition of New Zealand Sign Language as a second language  for students in an interpreting programme: the learners&#8217; perspective</field><field name="creator">Pivac, Lynette</field><field name="description">This research study presents an investigation of interpreter trainees acquiring New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL) as a second language (L2) outside their formal classroom learning. This study was motivated firstly by a concern that a considerable reduction in learner and lecturer contact hours within an NZSL interpreting programme would compromise graduate NZSL competency, necessitating a compensatory approach predominantly in the context of the Deaf community. Secondly, the study attempts to address a marked gap in research related to L2 sign language learning from a socio-cultural perspective. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in a bilingual context (NZSL and English) in order to gain the &#8216;inside&#8217; perspectives of six NZSL learners who had just completed a two-year Diploma in Sign Language Interpreting. The interviews sought to uncover the informal NZSL language learning opportunities used by the participants, especially within the social context of the Deaf community, and the individual learner strategies utilised by &#8216;good learners&#8217; of NZSL. Interview data were transcribed and were analysed by employing qualitative methods. Coding of the data revealed a number of categories which were subsequently examined for salient themes relating to the research questions. The main findings of the study revolved around the significance of L2 learner access to social and material resources, especially within the Deaf socio-cultural context. Of particular significance was the enhancement of learner motivation and confidence as was the frequency and depth of interaction with Deaf people and degree of mediated NZSL learning from NZSL mentors. Of key importance were the social relationships and networks developed with L1 users, which facilitated access to an array of NZSL learning opportunities. Material language learning resources, such as NZSL video samples and equipment were also useful, when interaction with Deaf people was not possible due to heavy study demands, especially in the second year of the programme. Learner involvement in the Deaf community, particularly within Deaf social networks, resulted in significantly improved linguistic, pragmatic and socio-cultural competency. The findings of the study raise two main implications.  Firstly, the study highlights the need for NZSL interpreting curriculum enrichment and the resourcing of the programme to foster learner autonomy.  Secondly, to date there has been little research on adult L2 sign language learning outside the classroom context and the study may stimulate further studies of the acquisition of sign language as a second language. The study may also be of benefit to autonomous L2 sign language learners and stakeholders in sign language interpreting education around the world.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sign language learning</field><field name="subject">Sociocultural perspective</field><field name="subject">Qualitative</field><field name="subject">Autonomous learning</field><field name="subject">Learning strategies</field><field name="subject">NZSL learning opportunities</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/764</field></doc><doc><field name="title">That&#8217;s no way to say goodbye: exit interviews and employee turnover in New Zealand hotels</field><field name="creator">Williamson, David</field><field name="description">The hospitality and tourism industry is an increasingly important part of the New Zealand economy, contributing almost nine percent of the Gross Domestic Product in 2008.  One of the key concerns regarding this part of the economy is the impact of a tight labour market and intense skill shortages on its ability to maximise returns from tourists.  Labour turnover rates have been extremely high in the hospitality sector over the past few years and this has contributed to the intense labour market pressures affecting this industry.  Hotels have suffered particularly high turnover rates in the past few years and exit interviews have been one of the tools that Human Resource Managers used to try and gain data about employee reasons for leaving.  This study looks at exit interviews as a source of data on the causes of labour turnover in two New Zealand hotel chains. The aim of this study was to analyse hotel exit interview data in order to identify significant patterns that might illuminate the causes and potential moderating factors of labour turnover in New Zealand hotels.  In addition, the study aimed to analyse the processes used to gather exit interview data in order to evaluate the efficacy of exit interviews and see if any practical recommendations could be made regarding the use of exit interviews to address labour turnover.  A qualititative, triangulated research methodology was applied in order to analyse the data generated from over 4500 exit interviews, from 17 hotels, in two New Zealand hotel brands.  The interviews cover six years of exit interview gathering.  In addition, in depth semi-structured interviews with six hotel Human Resource Managers were used to gain insight into the practice and perceptions around exit interviews. The study found that despite considerable application of time and resources, hotels gain very little benefit from the exit interview process.  Several issues are identified as bringing the efficacy of exit interviews into question, including power imbalance between interviewees and interviewers, language and cultural concerns, and the impact of psychological contract breaches on the employment relationship.  In addition, the study found that even when opportunities for organisational improvement did arise from exit interviews, little or no action was taken by the hotels in question.  The study concludes that there is insufficient benefit to the hotels given the costs of exit interviews and suggests that other forms of employee feedback, such as engagement surveys may be more efficacious in addressing labour turnover.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hospitality</field><field name="subject">Hotels</field><field name="subject">Exit interviews</field><field name="subject">Turnover</field><field name="subject">Labour</field><field name="subject">Employee</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/765</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural Characterisation, Residual Stress Determination and Degree of Sensitisation of Duplex Stainless Steel Welds</field><field name="creator">Gideon Abdullah, Mohammed Abdul Fatah</field><field name="description">Welding of duplex stainless steel pipeline material for the oil and gas industry is now common practice. To date, research has been conducted primarily on the parent material and heat affected zones in terms of its susceptibility to various forms of corrosion. However, there has been little research conducted on the degree of sensitisation of the various successive weld layers, namely the root, fill and cap layers.   The focus of this research study was to: (i) provide an in-depth microstructural analysis of the various weld passes, (ii) study the mechanical properties of the weld regions; (iii) determine degree of sensitisation of the various weld passes; and (iv) investigate the residual stress levels within the various regions/ phases of the welds.   Four test conditions were prepared using manual Gas Tungsten Arc Welding with 'V' and 'U' bevel configuration. Structural analysis consisted of (i) optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and magnetic force microscopy; (ii) ferrite determination using Magna-Gauge, Fischer Ferrite-scope and Point Count method. Mechanical testing consisted of Vickers hardness measurements, Charpy impact studies and transverse tensile testing. The degree of sensitisation was determined by three test methods: a modified ASTM A262, ASTM A923 and a modified Double Loop Electrochemical Potentiodynamic Reactivation (DL-EPR) test. Residual stress levels were determined using two neutron diffraction techniques: a reactor source and a time of flight spallation source.    Microstructure observed by optical microscopy and magnetic force microscopy shows the formation of both fine and coarse structures within the weld metal. There was no evidence of secondary austenite, being present in any of the weld metal conditions examined. In addition, no detrimental intermetallic phases or carbides were present.     The DL-EPR test results revealed that the fill layer regions for all four conditions and the base material showed the highest values for Ir/Ia and Qr/Qa. All four test conditions passed the ASTM A262 and A923 qualitative type tests, even under restricted and modified conditions.    Residual stress measurements by neutron diffraction conducted at Lucas Heights Hi-Flux Reactor revealed that the ferrite phase stress was tensile in the heat affected zones and weld, and appeared to be balanced by a local compressive austenite phase stresses in the normal and transverse directions.   Residual stress measurements by neutron diffraction conducted at Los Alamos Nuclear Science Centre revealed that in the hoop direction, ferrite (211) and austenite (311) exhibit tensile strains in the weld. In the axial and radial direction, the strains for both phases were more compressive.    Correlations between the degree of sensitization and microstructural changes / ferrite content were observed. Higher degrees of sensitization (Ir/Ia and Qr/Qa) were associated with reduced ferrite (increased austenite) content.     Correlations between the stresses generated, the evolved microstructures and degree of sensitization were evident. Stresses within the cap region were generally shown to be of a tensile nature in the transverse and longitudinal direction.    In summary, the study has shown that correlations exist between the weld microstructure, susceptibility to sensitisation and levels / distribution of internal stresses within the weld regions.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gas Tungsten Arc Welding</field><field name="subject">Residual Stress</field><field name="subject">Sensitisation</field><field name="subject">Intergranular Corrosion</field><field name="subject">Duplex Stainless Steel</field><field name="subject">Optical Microscopy</field><field name="subject">Scanning Electron Microscopy</field><field name="subject">Magnetic Force Microscopy</field><field name="subject">Double Loop Electrochemical Potentiodynamic Reactivation (DL-EPR)</field><field name="subject">Reactor Source</field><field name="subject">Time of Flight Spallation Source</field><field name="subject">Neutron Diffraction</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091110.101453</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multi-spectral remote sensing of native vegetation condition</field><field name="creator">Sheffield, Kathryn Jane</field><field name="description">Native vegetation condition provides an indication of the state of vegetation health or function relative to a stated objective or benchmark.  Measures of vegetation condition provide an indication of the vegetation's capacity to provide habitat for a range of species and ecosystem functions through the assessment of selected vegetation attributes.  Subsets of vegetation attributes are often combined into vegetation condition indices or metrics, which are used to provide information for natural resource management.      Despite their value as surrogates of biota and ecosystem function, measures of vegetation condition are rarely used to inform biodiversity assessments at scales beyond individual stands.  The extension of vegetation condition information across landscapes, and approaches for achieving this, using remote sensing technologies, is a key focus of the work presented in this thesis.        The aim of this research is to assess the utility of multi-spectral remotely sensed data for the recovery of stand-level attributes of native vegetation condition at landscape scales.  The use of remotely sensed data for the assessment of vegetation condition attributes in fragmented landscapes is a focus of this study. The influence of a number of practical issues, such as spatial scale and ground data sampling methodology, are also explored.  This study sets limitations on the use of this technology for vegetation condition assessment and also demonstrates the practical impact of data quality issues that are frequently encountered in these types of applied integrated approaches.      The work presented in this thesis demonstrates that while some measures of vegetation condition, such as vegetation cover and stem density, are readily recoverable from multi-spectral remotely sensed data, others, such as hollow-bearing trees and log length, are not easily derived from this type of data.  The types of information derived from remotely sensed data, such as texture measures and vegetation indices, that are useful for vegetation condition assessments of this nature are also highlighted.      The utility of multi-spectral remotely sensed data for the assessment of stand-level vegetation condition attributes is highly dependent on a number of factors including the type of attribute being measured, the characteristics of the vegetation, the sensor characteristics (i.e. the spatial, spectral, temporal, and radiometric resolution), and other spatial data quality considerations, such as site homogeneity and spatial scale.  A series of case studies are presented in this thesis that explores the effects of these factors.  These case studies demonstrate the importance of different aspects of spatial data and how data manipulation can greatly affect the derived relationships between vegetation attributes and remotely sensed data.      The work documented in this thesis provides an assessment of what can be achieved from two sources of multi-spectral imagery in terms of recovery of individual vegetation attributes from remotely sensed data.  Potential surrogate measures of vegetation condition that can be derived across broad scales are identified.  This information could provide a basis for the development of landscape scale multi-spectral remotely sensed based vegetation condition assessment approaches, supplementing information provided by established site-based vegetation condition assessment approaches.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multi-spectral remote sensing</field><field name="subject">vegetation condition</field><field name="subject">spatial data quality</field><field name="subject">ground data acquisition</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091110.112816</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between special educators in the DEECD Victorian Metropolitan Regions and Vietnamese parents of children with a disability</field><field name="creator">Le, Huong Thu</field><field name="description">The current thesis investigated the relationship between Vietnamese parents of children with a disability and special educators who worked with these parents in both mainstream and special schools in Melbourne Metropolitan Regions of the state of Victoria, Australia. The key objective of the study was to research the role of the parent-educator (interpersonal) relationship and its interrelatedness with the task: two major components of a home-school partnership. The research question that guided this study was 'How does the parent-educator relationship influence the operation of a family-centered home-school partnership?' With partnerships involving parents of diverse cultural backgrounds, investigating cultural influences on the partnership were an integral part of the research process. A qualitative interpretive approach was employed in searching for perceptions of involved parties about their home-school partnerships. The design selected was multiple embedded  case studies with purposeful sampling. Influences on home-school partnership were investigated from a multidimensional perspective and were described and interpreted from the views of both parents and educators. The findings indicated that the relationship played a much more significant role than the task in the successfulness of an intercultural home-school partnership. Without a mutual understanding of home-school communication, the collaboration was far from productive or even did not work out. There was also evidence that a harmonious parent-educator interpersonal relationship did not seem to have any influence on the effectiveness of a home-school partnership without parent-educator mutual understanding and agreement in terms of goals and roles expectations. The need for the educators to be more appropriately equipped with cultural training and family-centered principles also arose from the study findings.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Family-centered home-school partnership</field><field name="subject">parent-teacher interpersonal relationship</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091110.115137</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Television and drug abuse: a cultural studies approach to Thai health communication research</field><field name="creator">Young, Poungchompoo</field><field name="description">The main objective of this thesis is to illustrate the benefits of using a cultural studies approach in the field of health communication research in Thailand. In this thesis I apply a cultural studies approach to examine the construction of meanings involving drug use and abuse in Thai television advertisements and dramas. The thesis has as its focus analyses of television texts and audience responses.      The major arguments advanced in this thesis are that:   (a)	the causes of drug use and abuse are complex;   (b)	drug use and abuse, particularly given the 'risk culture' and 'risk society' of the post-modern world, are products of individual social and cultural contexts;   (c)	cultural studies assist us to better understand the cultural dimension of human behaviour, including the causes of drug use and abuse; and so   (d)	by adopting a cultural studies approach to the design and production of health promotion campaigns, such campaigns may be made more effective.      The thesis argues that in designing health promotion campaigns, health professionals should be concerned to better understand the complexity of their audiences and the manner in which members of those audiences construct meanings and make sense of texts. Should they do so, the designers of health promotion campaigns may, thereby, develop a more sophisticated understanding of what is necessary to contribute to changing audience behaviour. This, in turn, may assist them to improve the design and effectiveness of future health promotion campaigns.      The principal tool drawn from cultural studies used in this thesis is textual analysis. This research method involves making an educated guess at some of the most likely interpretations that might be made of a text. In addition, it demonstrates the complexity of the process of making media texts. The texts analysed in this study are selected from two genres of television: television advertisements and television dramas. I analyse television advertisements used in health promotion / drug prevention campaigns broadcast in Thailand in the period from 1990 to 2004 and two well known Thai television dramas entitled Kam See Than Don: KSTD (1999) and Num Poo: NP (2002).</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cultural studies</field><field name="subject">television</field><field name="subject">drug abuse</field><field name="subject">health communication</field><field name="subject">research methods</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091111.095138</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving internet usability - a framework for domain name policy evaluation.</field><field name="creator">Rowe, Joshua Luke</field><field name="description">A domain name is a unique alphanumeric designation that facilitates reference to sets of numbers which actually locate a particular computer on the Internet.  Domain names are a fundamental part of the Internet's user interface.  Improving the usability of the Internet depends upon effective domain name policy.  This study is intended to contribute to improvement in Internet usability for the end users of domain names.  Benefits of more usable domain names include: higher sales, customer satisfaction and productivity, and reduced support costs.      Domain name policies worldwide vary considerably.  Consequently, end users are inconvenienced by contradictory domain name policies, diminishing the predictability of an entity's domain name, and thus decreasing usability for end users.      The study objective was to develop criteria with which policy makers can evaluate their domain name policies, in order to improve the usability of domain names for end users.  The main research question posed was: What are the criteria for an effective domain name policy?  The research methodology included a literature review, domain name policy examination and an ethnographic narrative.      The literature review found existing research examining either domain names or usability in isolation.  However, research examining the intersection of the two is scarce.  The existing research describes domain names as part of the web user interface.  In practical terms, this is about how people use domain names to access web sites, email addresses and other Internet resources.  It was established that the predictability (and thus usability) of domain names relies on effective domain name policy.  The non-standardised and widely delegated process of domain name policy development leads to unpredictable and inconsistent domain names.      The narrative recollection presented the researcher's inside perspective on the domain name industry, with a focus on domain name usability.  The researcher provided first-hand insights into the evolution of the industry and policy development process, from Australian and international perspectives.      To address the problem of poor domain name usability, a framework for domain name policy evaluation is proposed.  The framework extends the current research that treats domain names as a user interface by proposing criteria which address usability concerns.  The framework allows policy makers to critically assess domain name policies with end users in mind.  Examples of the criteria include: understanding who are its intended and untended users, and whether it's consistent with other domain names.  The framework has the potential to set an international standard for the critical evaluation of domain name policy, and become the basis for further research.      This study was developed from the researcher's perspective as a participant in the domain name industry.  A secondary lens regarding the usability of domain names was then applied.  This study has only scraped the surface in terms of how the research fields of domain names and usability may be considered together.  The research methodology for this study was primarily qualitative and interpretive.  A quantitative study of domain name policies globally could provide further insight into areas including: the differences in second level country code domain names, and language implications of domain names.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Domain name usability</field><field name="subject">domain names</field><field name="subject">usability</field><field name="subject">Internet governanance</field><field name="subject">Internet politics</field><field name="subject">Internet economics</field><field name="subject">electronic identifiers</field><field name="subject">telecommunications</field><field name="subject">Internet standards</field><field name="subject">domain name policy</field><field name="subject">intellectual property</field><field name="subject">trademarks</field><field name="subject">Internet security</field><field name="subject">Internet privacy</field><field name="subject">web site design</field><field name="subject">web site usability</field><field name="subject">human-computer interaction</field><field name="subject">online marketing</field><field name="subject">online brands.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091111.101705</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ankle sprains: an investigation into patient perceptions and performance of physical tasks following acute ankle sprains using a mixed methods approach</field><field name="creator">Larmer, Peter John</field><field name="description">Introduction: Ankle injuries are among the most prevalent acute musculoskeletal injuries, and are a significant burden on any health system. The interaction of the physiotherapist with the patient and their mutual understanding of impairments, function and recovery are important to achieving a satisfactory return to work and leisure activities.  To date, little attention has focused on this interaction.   There is a need for further exploration of differences and associations between outcome questionnaires that investigate similar domains of pain and function, and whether scores from such outcome measures are related to the patient&#8217;s perception of function and recovery.  Of further interest is whether there are relationships between impairment measures and perceived function, and how actual performance of tasks might influence the patients understanding of their capabilities. To provide a more complete picture of these relationships, a &#8216;mixed methods&#8217; approach using qualitative research methods within a quantitative study was thought to be most appropriate. The overall aim of this thesis was to utilise this research approach to investigate patients&#8217; perceptions of their recovery and elucidate factors important to both therapists and patients that ultimately might enhance their understanding of recovery from an ankle injury. Literature reviews: Three literature reviews were undertaken. Firstly a review of systematic reviews investigating ankle sprains identified a wide variety of management strategies. There was a lack of strong evidence to support any particular management strategy. Hence clinicians are likely to have difficulty setting appropriate rehabilitation plans. Secondly a critical review identified a number of different outcome questionnaires that were utilised to gauge recovery level; however, justification for their selection was often lacking. This review also identified that little emphasis was placed on understanding the patients&#8217; perception of their injury and the rehabilitation process. A final critical review investigated impairment and performance measures and identified four specific areas that were focused upon by clinicians during the treatment of ankle sprains: joint position sense, postural control, strength and performance during function. However, only weak evidence was found for there being a deficit in joint position sense, postural control and strength in the injured limb following an ankle sprain, and inconclusive evidence of deficits in physical performance of tasks related to function.  Methods: Forty participants with an acute sprained ankle were recruited along with their treating physiotherapist. The participants completed a Global questionnaire, the Lower Limb Task Questionnaire (LLTQ) and the Short Form -36 (SF-36) Questionnaire at the initial visit, at discharge and at a six week follow up visit where they also undertook impairment testing involving, joint position sense, postural control and strength along with a functional performance test and selected functional activities. Ten participants were purposefully selected to undertake semi-structured interviews. The treating physiotherapists completed global questionnaires at the initial visit and at time of discharge. An interpretive hermeneutic approach was undertaken to examine the participants&#8217; perceptions. Results: There were equal numbers of males and female participants and the average age of participants was 30.5 years. The relationship between questionnaires for the domains of pain and function varied between low and high degrees of association. The global limitations scores between the participants and physiotherapists were similar at the initial visit, whereas on discharge the participants had a significantly lower score (p&lt;0.05) compared to the physiotherapists. With respect to impairment testing, there was a significant difference (p&lt;0.05) between the uninjured limb compared to the injured limb for the joint position sense and performance agility hop test. All other comparisons of impairments were not significant (p&gt;0.05). There was no association between questionnaire scores and impairment measures (p&gt;0.05). Additionally there were no significant associations between previous injury and questionnaire scores and impairment measures. Finally in relation to the performance of specific functional tests there was a significant difference (p&lt;0.05) between the six week follow up LLTQ score and the score following actual performance of the test. The findings of the participants&#8217; interviews identified three key concerns. Firstly, that participants have a limited understanding of questionnaires, and secondly, that there is a difference in understanding of &#8216;recovery&#8217; between the therapist and the patient at time of discharge. Thirdly, there was dissociation between outcome measures and the patient&#8217;s perception of their own recovery. Conclusions: This study revealed a lack of understanding and effective communication concerning physiotherapy practice in relation to ankle sprains. It was apparent that questionnaires purporting to measure similar constructs are at times dissimilar in scores and are not related strongly. Care needs to be taken in selecting and interpreting outcome measures particularly in relation to questionnaires. It was also apparent that caution should be exercised when considering the influence of impairment measures upon function. Physiotherapists should be aware that patients may perceive a lack of confidence in their level of function at the time of discharge. As a result physiotherapists need to incorporate strategies to improve patient confidence in their management plan.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ankle sprain</field><field name="subject">Outcomes</field><field name="subject">Physiotherapy</field><field name="subject">Mixed methods</field><field name="subject">Functional measures</field><field name="subject">Questionnaires</field><field name="subject">Perceived function</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/766</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning professional ethical practice:  The speech pathology experience</field><field name="creator">Smith, Helen Barbara</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT
An ethics curriculum is an integral part of most health profession courses.  This thesis will explore using a qualitative approach to investigate the learning and application of professional ethical practice by Flinders University speech pathology students.  This work will identify factors that may influence students&#146; readiness to learn about ethics.  The knowledge, skills and attitudes that underpin professional ethical practice which speech pathology students were able to demonstrate at the conclusion of their entry level course will be illustrated.  Also described will be the factors, identified by students and academics and field educators, which may influence student learning of this complex area of practice.  
To explore this topic, the results of &#147;The Defining Issues Test&#148; (Rest, 1979b) of moral judgement development, independent and scaffolded case studies, as well as group and individual interviews with students, and individual interviews with academic and field educators have been used.    
Results from this study suggest that a significant number of the undergraduate speech pathology students involved in this study found learning and applying ethical principles difficult, as their ability to reason morally remained conventional and rule bound.  At the point of graduation, the students applied clinical and ethical reasoning skills, whilst emerging, were not yet well developed.  The ability of students to demonstrate the integration of ethical theory and practice appeared limited.  This lack of integration may be influenced by the fact that few field educators could report being exposed to formal ethical theories and ethical reasoning approaches during their own undergraduate education.  Some of the more generic ethical practice skills reported by academics as being embedded throughout the speech pathology course, such as communication, team work and the seeking of professional support, were more clearly demonstrated by students.  
Results of this study suggest that exiting students and newly graduated speech pathologists require ongoing support in the area of professional ethical practice.  More explicit embedding of the theoretical underpinnings of the ethics knowledge base throughout the curriculum may be required.  To be able to support the integration of professional ethical practice in students and new graduates, speech pathologists currently practising in the field who did not receive formal ethics education during their own degree or since, may require ongoing professional development in the formal knowledge base pertaining to professional ethical practice.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ethics curriculum</field><field name="subject">ethics teaching</field><field name="subject">learning ethical practice</field><field name="subject">field education</field><field name="subject">speech pathology ethical practice</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20091110.081021</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The diagnosis of subacromial impingement syndrome and associated pathology in the primary care setting</field><field name="creator">Harvey, Daniel</field><field name="description">Diagnosing shoulder pain conditions is a challenging area of musculoskeletal practice.  Subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) is a clinical syndrome that indicates pain and pathology involving the subacromial bursa and rotator cuff tendons within the subacromial space. The three stages of SIS are subacromial bursitis, partial thickness and full thickness rotator cuff tears. The cause of SIS is believed to be multi-factorial with both extrinsic and intrinsic factors involved in its pathogenesis. Clinicians have traditionally diagnosed SIS using a clinical examination including a subjective history followed by confirmatory clinical tests. A review of the evidence for diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests highlights that individual tests have poor diagnostic accuracy. A combination of clinical tests or a clinical examination per se may be useful at ruling out rotator cuff tears, but is less accurate at detecting rotator cuff tears when it is present. There is consensus in the literature that particular combinations of signs and clinical features may be useful in diagnosing rotator cuff tears but not for diagnosing SIS. The vast majority of research to date examining the clinical diagnosis of SIS has been focused on individual clinical tests carried out by medical practitioners in specialist and tertiary care settings. This review has established that the majority of diagnostic accuracy studies for SIS and rotator cuff tears have had poor methodological design. This exploratory study was conducted with subjects undergoing a standardized clinical examination (index test) by a physiotherapist. The decision as to which specific tests were chosen for this research was based on supporting research within the literature and the test&#8217;s actual use within the New Zealand clinical setting.  This included subjective history questions, active and passive shoulder movement tests and eleven SIS tests. Subjects were referred for a diagnostic ultrasound scan immediately following the clinical examination and results from the scan stood as the criterion reference standard. Thirty eight individuals (males n=23, females n=15) with new onset shoulder pain, who met the inclusion criteria, were assessed by a participating physiotherapist. Sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratios, negative likelihood ratios and respective 95% confidence intervals were calculated for all variables of the examination. Individual variables from the clinical examination were tested for their association with the diagnostic ultrasound scan reference criterion using Pearson Chi-Squared Exact test. Potential predictor variables were retained as potential predictors for use in the logistic regression analysis to determine the most accurate set of clinical examination variables for diagnosing SIS and the individual pathological stages of SIS. The results indicate that no historical, subjective or objective features from the clinical examination are accurate in diagnosing SIS or rotator cuff tears. The presence of night pain demonstrated a significant correlation (P&lt;0.02) with the criterion reference standard for the presence of subacromial bursa fluid/bunching. Night pain and pain with overhead activity has a high sensitivity for subacromial bursa fluid/bunching being present. The absence of night pain and the absence of pain with overhead activity are two subjective phenomena from a clinical examination that are useful in ruling out subacromial bursa fluid/bunching being present. Night pain was also found to be the best predictor of subacromial bursa fluid/bunching being present (P&lt;0.012). Male gender (P&lt;0.034) was the best predictor of partial thickness rotator cuff tears while being 60 years of age or older (P&lt;0.01) significantly correlated with full thickness rotator cuff tears. The Drop Arm Sign (P&lt;0.01) and External Rotation Lag Sign (P&lt;0.01) were significantly correlated with SIS and full thickness rotator cuff tears. Clinical tests for all three pathological stages of SIS and subacromial bursa fluid/bunching being present, had equivalent or if not greater diagnostic accuracy than previous report studies in the literature. The Hawkins-Kennedy Test and Neer Sign can be used in the primary care setting to rule out the presence of subacromial bursa fluid/bunching or SIS if the tests are negative. For mid to end stage SIS (rotator cuff tears) the Empty Can Test and Drop Arm Sign with their high sensitivity can be used to rule out rotator cuff tears especially to the supraspinatus tendon when the tests are negative. Despite the small sample size and other limitations of this study, the findings are an important addition to the current literature surrounding the diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests for SIS and rotator cuff tears. This is the first study to use physiotherapists as examiners and to be set in a primary care setting. The study is also the first to examine the diagnostic accuracy of a range of historical and subjective features from the clinical examination. The results found in the current study could be used by future studies as a starting point in the development of a clinical decision or prediction rule to assist clinicians in the diagnosis of SIS and rotator cuff tears.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Subacromial impingement syndrome</field><field name="subject">Physiotherapy</field><field name="subject">Clinical examination</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/768</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Increasing parental physical activity via children's advocacy: the 'walk your dad' study</field><field name="creator">Anthony, Julie Michelle</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a child-focused, school-delivered physical activity program on daily steps of children and their paternal parent, and to evaluate the acceptability to teachers of the 'Walk your Dad' program.    A pre-test, post-test experimental/control groups design was used.  The sample, recruited from Eltham College of Education, consisted of 60 children aged 10- to 13-years and 48 paternal parents aged 35- to 64-years.  Physical activity levels were assessed over a 6-day period using New Lifestyles pedometers, 1-week prior to and 1-week after the intervention.  The 12-week intervention consisted of two cross curriculum homework activities per week delivered to children by their classroom teacher, focusing on increasing physical activity behaviours of children and their paternal parent.  Following cleaning and imputation, data were analysed using descriptive statistics and repeated measures ANOVA.  Teachers (n=2) of intervention group participants independently completed a survey on the acceptability of the program in the week following its completion.        Mean weekend steps for children in the intervention group increased from 15,436 +/- 7,680 at pre-test to 19,575 +/- 10,537 at post-test, while among control group children steps decreased from 17,981 +/- 6,552 to 17,278 +/- 6,769.  On weekdays (4-days), mean steps for children in the intervention group increased from 46,090 +/- 16,001 to 48,760 +/- 13,648, while among control group children, steps decreased from 46,907 +/- 9,912 to 43,717 +/- 10,255.  Mean weekend steps for paternal parents in the intervention group increased from 15,116 +/- 5,640 to 17,473 +/- 6,836, while among control group paternal parents steps decreased from 18,239 +/- 8,345 to 17,836 +/- 6,855.  On weekdays (four days) mean steps for paternal parents in the intervention group increased from 31,141 +/- 13,246 to 31,507 +/- 13,132 while among control group paternal parents steps decreased from 34,942 +/- 11,109 to 32,502 +/- 12,602.  Repeated measures ANOVA analyses revealed that on weekends for children there were significant differenc es between pre- and post-test (p less than.000), between pre- and post-test for boys and girls (p less than.000), and between boys, girls, intervention and control class (p =.01) at post-test.  On weekdays for children there was a significant difference between intervention and control class at post-test (p =.01).  Results for paternal parents indicated that there was a significant difference on weekends between pre- and post-test (p less than.000) and on weekdays there was a significant difference between intervention and control class at post-test (p =.05).  Both intervention class teachers had consistent views about the program.    	   The findings suggest that during the period of research and among this group, the intervention had a positive effect on weekend step behaviour of girls and weekday step behaviour of girls, boys and their paternal parents.  The process evaluation revealed some aspects of the program may require modification.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physical activity</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Fathers</field><field name="subject">Pedometer</field><field name="subject">School</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091112.113500</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Finding meaning: differentiating the multiple discourses of the Potter farmland plan</field><field name="creator">Wagg, Catherine Anne</field><field name="description">This study explores the meanings that people attributed to their involvement in a participatory on-farm practice change project. Three techniques of discourse analysis were used. The first two identify the diversity among narratives of the participants and explores the origin of these differences. The third technique examined differences and tensions within and across the narratives to identify the discourses that were operating.  Participation was found to be mediated through discourse as agents created and reproduced some discourses through their many social acts. For example, some participants recalled incidences of feeling excluded when they presented an alternative understanding of the project. As a result, these people tended to reduced their involvement rather than explore the differences.  The project's discourses therefore routinised the participatory experience and tended to lock the narrative in time despite over two decades of rapid social change. Thi s meant the project discourse mediated a favoured type of participation, one that met a symbolic character rather than the particular farming practices it promoted.  The discourses reveal different patterns of sense making among participants involved in the same event. Uneven participation is comprehended from the multiple patterns as a consequence of the participants' discursive practices.  Articulating differences in discursive design will assist to create conditions useful for an authentic communication among participants engaged in change programs.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">narrative</field><field name="subject">practice change</field><field name="subject">farm practices</field><field name="subject">beliefs</field><field name="subject">meaning</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091112.121423</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of pulsed electric field processing on microbial, enzymatic and physical attributes of milk and the rennet-induced milk gels</field><field name="creator">Shamsi, Kambiz</field><field name="description">The PEF treatments were conducted at field intensities of 25-37 kV cm-1 (up to 50 kV cm-1)and temperature range of 30&#176;C to 75&#186;C. Native milk enzymes selected for the study included alkaline phosphatase, lipase, xanthine oxidase and plasminand  microbiological study included determining Total Plate Count (TPC) and Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae counts in skim milk.        At 30&#186;C PEF treatment at maximum field intensity inactivated AlP by 42% while at 60oC inactivation was higher (67%).  Under these treatment conditions less than1 log reduction in TPC and Pseudomonas count and 2.1 logs reduction in the Enterobacteriaceae count was achieved at 30oC while at 60&#186;C TPC dropped by 2.4 logs and Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae counts were reduced by 5.9 and 2.1 logs, respectively to below the detection limit of 1 CFU mL-1.       Combining PEF treatment with heat increased the inactivation level of all enzymes which showed an increasing trend with increasing field intensity and temperature.  Treatment time (4.8, 9.6, 19.2, 28.8 and 38.4 &#181;s) was controlled by either changing the pulse frequencies (100-400 Hz) or product flow rate (30-240 mL min-1) at a constant field intensity of 31 kV cm-1 and it was found that changing the flow rate was a more effective way of enzyme inactivation than changing the frequency due to longer exposure time of enzymes to heat and field intensity.       The size of casein micelles and fat globules was not affected by PEF treatment while severe heating of milk at 97oC for 10 min decreased both micelle and fat globule sizes marginally. The coagulation time of rennet-induced gels made from PEF-treated (35 to 50 kV cm-1) milks (whole and skim) increased as the treatment intensity increased, but remained shorter than gels made from pasteurised milk.       The PEF treatment of milk at various field intensities and temperatures adversely affected the G&#8242;, G&#8242;&#8242; and firmness of gels, but the effects were less pronounced than in gels made from pasteurised milks.       This study concludes that for successful application in milk processing the PEF treatment needs to be combined with mild heat treatment. This approach could achieve safer milk with less damage to milk functionality. However, the quest for a suitable quality assurance indicator enzyme will need more extensive studies.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pulsed electric field (PEF)</field><field name="subject">nonthermal processing</field><field name="subject">microbial inactivation</field><field name="subject">enzyme inactivation</field><field name="subject">rheological and textural analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091112.141102</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in the treatment of migraine: A systematic review and a randomised controlled trial.</field><field name="creator">Wang, Yanyi</field><field name="description">Migraine affects 8 -16% of population in different countries resulting in significant economic and social impacts. Current pharmacological treatment provides symptomatic relief, but not without side effects. Hence, an increasing proportion of patients prefer complementary therapies including acupuncture for migraine relief.       Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of acupuncture treatment for migraine have produced conflicting evidence due to methodological and reporting deficiencies, including small sample sizes and inappropriate outcome measures. Furthermore, systematic reviews on acupuncture for headache failed to adequately represent non-English studies such as those conducted in China.      This project aimed to: (1) systematically review studies of acupuncture for migraine; and (2) conduct a RCT addressing key deficiencies identified from the systematic reviews (SRs).       Two SRs were conducted based onfollowing Cochrane review protocols. Major English, Chinese, Japanese and Korean databases were searched. The first SR included 15 English studies and the second SR had 17 Chinese studies. No Japanese or Korean RCTs were identified. Overall, those two SRs supported the value of acupuncture in the treatment and prevention of migraine when compared with western medications. However, conflicting results were found when real acupuncture treatments were compared with sham/placebo procedures. When compared with the studies published in English, Chinese studies had a higher frequency of acupuncture treatment, displayed poor methodological quality, and commonly used pharmacotherapy as a comparator. The SRs revealed that there was limited evaluation of acupuncture for frequent migraine.      In the RCT, fifty participants with a minimum of eight migraine days per four weeks were randomly allocated to receive real (RA, n = 26) and sham (SA, n = 24) acupuncture for a total of 16 sessions over 20 weeks in a gradually decreasing treatment frequency. Fixed and supplementary acupoints were used. Participants were followed up for further assessment at three months and one year. Results showed that at the end of the treatment period, the mean (SD) migraine attack days per four weeks decreased from 11.81 (5.76) to 5.17 (5.02) in the RA group and from 12.41 (6.4) to 10.08 (7.11) in SA (group difference: p = .008). Intensity of migraine assessed using a Six-point Likert scale was lower in the RA (2.18 &#177;1.05) than that in the SA group (2.93 &#177; 0.61, p = 0.004). The percentile changes of pressure pain threshold (PPTs) detected at the bilateral points of TaiYang (Ex-HN5) were significantly higher in the RA group (RA 228.48% vs. SA -0.66 % on the left and 92.69% vs. -2.52% on the right). However, there was no s tatistically significant difference between the two groups with respect to Migraine Specific Quality of Life (MSQOL). At the end of the three-month follow up, medication consumption was less in the RA group, but not at the one-year follow up.       In conclusion, this project demonstrates that acupuncture is a potentially effective and safe option for adult patients with frequent migraine headache with the effects lasting up to three months. Further studies are needed to confirm these therapeutic benefits with adequate sample sizes and the potential mechanism for this action.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">acupuncture</field><field name="subject">migraine</field><field name="subject">systematic review</field><field name="subject">clinical trial</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091113.102639</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aging structure life prediction and reliability assessment</field><field name="creator">Che, Yunxiang</field><field name="description">Confront with the serious aging problem in aircraft structure field, the profession was tasked to unveil the mysterious in the mechanism of aging. In decades, many endeavours were put into different subjects such as, fatigue and crack calculation, corrosion analysis, reliability evaluation, life prediction, structure monitor and protection, structure repair, etc.      In an effort of developing a reasonable model for life prediction and reliability evaluation, a wide range of topics in the field of aging structure reliability are reviewed. Many existing methods and tools are carefully studied to distinguish the advantages, disadvantages and the special application. With consideration of corrosion fatigue life, and based on the data obtained through investigating service status of the aging aircraft, a fuzzy reliability approach is proposed and presented.      Initially, the thesis presents the literature review in the field, introducing the well-established theories and analysis tools of reliability and points out how such these methods can be used to assess the life and reliability of aging structure. Meanwhile, some characteristic parameters and distributions, as well as some crucial calculation formulations, procedures for aging aircraft reliability/risk analysis are given.      Secondly, mathematical models are established to evaluate the initial crack size and to assess both randomness and fuzziness of the variables, which also successfully work out the probability of survival of existing structures over a time period and predict the operation time under specific reliability requirement. As a practical approach to the reliability of aging aircraft structure, example is presented and evaluated.      While conduct the calculation, a few programs based on FORTRAN code are developed to solve the none-linear equation, to work out the multi dimension integration and to simulate the survival probability. The crack life prediction software AFGROW is selected for comparison of the calculation results, which also shows the appropriate accuracy of the established model.      As conclusion, the effects of some variables including fuzzy factors on reliability and life of aging aircraft structure are finally discussed. It is apparent that the confines of the model are existing as fact because of the huge assumption of the parameters input and model uncertainties. Suggestions on further prospective research are proposed respectively.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aging aircraft structure</field><field name="subject">Corrosion and Fatigue analysis</field><field name="subject">Reliability assessment</field><field name="subject">Fatigue crack growth</field><field name="subject">Life prediction</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091113.114541</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tourism industry responses to the rise of sustainable tourism and related environmental policy initiatives: the case of Hue City, Vietnam</field><field name="creator">Bui, Duc Tinh</field><field name="description">Tourism is promoted by the governments of many developing countries because it offers the potential for creating jobs, thus generating income for the country and revenue for the government. However, the tourism industry can also be viewed as a destructive force, associated with negative externalities such as the loss of natural landscapes, congestion, and environmental and cultural degradation. These problems are more likely to be exacerbated where there is a lack of well-designed planning and effective management of tourism development. An essential component of any management of tourism is the ability to engage with, and get a positive response from, the tourism industry. There are a wide range of enterprises involved in providing tourist products and experiences, and in many nations, both developing and developed, a large number of these businesses are small and medium in size and tend to operate at a local scale. The informal nature of tourism enterprises in the developing world can make it difficult to spread awareness of tourism policy and to measure moves towards more sustainable performance on the part of the industry. Using the case study of tourism in the city of Hue, this thesis argues that it is essential to understand both what tourism enterprises know about sustainable tourism practice and policy and also how they respond to its adoption, if we are to more fully understand tourism and its links to sustainable economic development. Located on the central northern coast of Vietnam, Hue is well known for its cultural resources and natural beauty, and the province has become a major tourism centre in Vietnam. The city of Hue itself is recognized as having international heritage value and was listed as a world cultural heritage site by UNESCO in 1993. During the last decade, tourism revenues have increased by nearly 35% per annum, and Hue has made great efforts to both stimulate and cater for increasing demand for its tourism products and services. The Vietnamese government has introduced a number of policies designed to enhance environmental quality generally and, more specifically, to improve the sustainability of enterprises in the tourism sector. This thesis examines the degree to which tourism enterprises in the city of Hue are aware of the broad concept of sustainable tourism and of the specific legislation designed to influence the sustainability of their businesses. I examine the structure and make-up of the industry and then analyse whether characteristics such as size, ownership type and sectoral focus play a role in influencing awareness of, and response to, government policy. The research triangulates data-gathering methods: secondary data, literature reviews, semi-structured interviews and an enterprise survey are all used to gain insights into the core research questions. Each method feeds into and is strengthened by the others, and their combination (including 50 interviews and 180 survey responses) provides a robust data set to work from. The findings reveal that many of the firms operating in the Hue tourism industry are characterized by weak institutional practices, low financial capacity, poor facilities and a lack of broader awareness of policies that influence sustainable tourism practice. The tourism industry&#8217;s awareness of general sustainable development issues is low, and much business practice focuses on short-term rather than long-term perspectives. This limits the use of environmentally friendly practices by firms, especially small- and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs), in their daily business activities.  The study reveals that there is no significant variation in the adoption of sustainable tourism practices according to the size of enterprises, especially if the practices in question are simple and can be introduced with cost savings. However, as the cost and complexity of introducing environmental measures increases, we see a greater ability on the part of larger enterprises to adopt such actions &#8211; partly because they are in a stronger position to bear the short-terms costs of implementing such approaches. There are a wide range of factors that constrain the Hue tourism industry from adopting more sustainable tourism practices. Internal constraints such as limited financial and human resources are combined with external constraints such as increasing cost-based competition, the lack of enforcement of government policies, and limited awareness of sustainable tourism pracitces. All of these factors play a crucial role in shaping the actions of enterprises in relation to sustainable tourism practices and policies. The results of this study also point to the fact that government sustainable tourism initiatives that rely on &#8216;command-and-control&#8217; approaches will have limited effect; instead, a variety of institutional economic instruments offer greater potential to overcome deficiencies in the ability of the market to drive tourism enterprises towards more sustainable business practices. The thesis also argues that it is important to develop approaches that can cope with the special challenges attached to management of sustainable tourism development in destinations that are dominated by SMEs. The thesis contributes to the growing body of theory and literature in sustainable tourism development and tourism-enterprise behaviour. It also makes an important contribution to our understanding of tourism enterprises in the developing world. In particular, the findings add an important layer of understanding to those attempting to develop a more sustainable tourism industry in Vietnam. Specifically, it provides policy-makers with important insights into the ways in which different types of tourism enterprises respond to initiatives that relate to improved business sustainability.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sustainable tourism</field><field name="subject">Triangulation</field><field name="subject">Environmentally friendly practices</field><field name="subject">Tourism industry</field><field name="subject">Responses</field><field name="subject">Environment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/769</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#8216;Sandcastles&#8217; &amp; &#8216;The Postmodern Rules For Family Living&#8217;</field><field name="creator">Fee, Roderick Harold</field><field name="description">The exegesis accompanies a thesis, the latter being the portfolio of work consisting of two parts, each being a completed first draft of a novel written during the Masters of Creative Writing course: Part 1:  &#8216;Sandcastles&#8217; - a 'closed' text novel Part 2:  &#8216;The Postmodern Rules For Family Living&#8217; - an 'open' text novel These two works are separately bound with a thesis cover sheet and numbered.

These include Birch, 1965 p90; Brindle, 2000; Callicott, 1994; Gardner, 2002, 2003, 2006; Gore Jr., 1992; Gottlieb, 2006, 2007; Hallman, 2000; Hamilton, 2006b, a, 2007b; Hessel &amp; Ruether, 2000b; Hitchcock, 1999; King, 2002; Lerner, 2006a; McDonagh, 1987; McFague, 2001; McKenzie, 2005; Nasr, 1996; Oelschlaeger, 1994; Palmer, 1992; Randers, 1972; Tucker &amp; Grim, 2000; and White Jr., 1967. Proponents offer a variety of reasons for this view, including that the majority of the world&#146;s and many nations&#146; people identify themselves as religious, and that there is a large amount of land and infrastructure controlled by religious organisations worldwide. However, the most important reason is that &#145;religion&#146; is said to have one or more exceptional qualities that can drive and sustain dramatic personal and societal change. The underlying or sometimes overt suggestion is that as the ecological crisis is ultimately a moral crisis, religion is best placed to address the problem at its root.
&#182;
Proponents of the above views are often religious, though there are many who are not. Many proponents are from the USA and write in the context of the powerful role of religion in that country. Others write in a global context. Very few write from or about the Australian context where the role of religion in society is variously argued to be virtually non-existent, soon to be non-existent, or conversely, profound but covert.
&#182;
This thesis tests the proposition that religion is the solution to the ecological crisis. It does this using a case study of mainstream religion in Australia, represented by the Catholic, Anglican, and Uniting Churches. The Churches&#146; ecological policies and practices are analysed to determine the extent to which these denominations are fulfilling, or might be able to fulfil, the proposition. The primary research method is an Internet-based search for policy and praxis material. The methodology is Critical Human Ecology.
&#182;
The research finds that: the &#145;greening&#146; of these denominations is evident; it is a recent phenomenon in the older Churches; there is a growing wealth of environmentalist sentiment and ecological policy being produced; but little institutional praxis has occurred. Despite the often-strong rhetoric, there is no evidence to suggest that ecological concerns, even linked to broader social concerns (termed &#145;ecojustice&#146;) are &#145;core business&#146; for the Churches as institutions. Conventional institutional and anthropocentric welfare concerns remain dominant.
&#182;
Overall, the three Churches struggle with organisational, demographic, and cultural problems that impede their ability to convert their official ecological concerns into institutional praxis. Despite these problems, there are some outstanding examples of ecological policy and praxis in institutional and non-institutional forms that at least match those seen in mainstream secular society. 
&#182;
I conclude that in Australia, mainstream religion is a limited part of the solution to the ecological crisis. It is not the solution to the crisis, at least not in its present institutional form. Institutional Christianity is in decline in Australia and is being replaced by non-institutional Christianity, other religions and non-religious spiritualities (Tacey, 2000, 2003; Bouma, 2006; Tacey, 2007). The ecological crisis is a moral crisis, but in Australia, morality is increasingly outside the domain of institutional religion. The growth of the non-institutional religious and the &#145;spiritual but not religious&#146; demographic may, if ecologically informed, offer more of a contribution to addressing the ecological crisis in future. This may occur in combination with some of the more progressive movements seen at the periphery of institutional Christianity such as the &#145;eco-ministry&#146; of Rev. Dr. Jason John in Adelaide, and the &#145;Creation Spirituality&#146; taught, advocated and practiced by the Mercy Sisters&#146; Earth Link project in Queensland.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">religious environmentalism</field><field name="subject">religion and ecology</field><field name="subject">religion and environmentalism</field><field name="subject">political religion</field><field name="subject">Catholicism</field><field name="subject">Anglicanism</field><field name="subject">Uniting Church</field><field name="subject">Australian religion</field><field name="subject">ecological conversion</field><field name="subject">faith and ecology</field><field name="subject">faith and environmentalism</field><field name="subject">the 'greening' of religion</field><field name="subject">the 'greening' of the Church</field><field name="subject">religion and climate change</field><field name="subject">human ecology</field><field name="subject">human ecology religious aspects</field><field name="subject">faith-based environmentalism</field><field name="subject">Christianity and environmentalism</field><field name="subject">Christianity and ecology</field><field name="subject">ecotheology</field><field name="subject">nature conservation religious aspects</field><field name="subject">environmental protection religious aspects</field><field name="subject">ecospirituality</field><field name="subject">ecological spirituality</field><field name="subject">transpersonal ecology</field><field name="subject">ecopsychology</field><field name="subject">ecophilosophy</field><field name="subject">environmental philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20091111.144835</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The magic casements: a survey of school library history from the eighth to the twentieth century</field><field name="creator">Clyde, Laurel A.</field><field name="description">The thesis comprises three major parts. In Part I, existing writing, both published and unpublished, on the history of school libraries, is surveyed, showing that there is available no comprehensive history of school libraries, or even of school libraries in a country or region. In Part II, the development of school libraries is traced from the eighth century library at York to the school library media centres of the present day, with emphasis on British, American, and Australian school libraries. This chronological survey covers medieval English school libraries, the libraries of the grammar schools of sixteenth and seventeenth century Britain, the elementary and Sunday school libraries of the nineteenth century, the libraries of "public", academy, and independent secondary schools in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and the secondary, elementary, and Sunday school libraries of the twentieth century. In Part III, "Concepts of the School Library", the development of school libraries is considered in terms of the reasons for which such libraries have been established and maintained over the centuries. The five types of school library discussed are: the school library established to support the teaching and learning activities of the school; the school library established to provide recreational reading; the library established to serve both the school and the community; the school library established as a scholars' library to serve the needs of a particular group within the school; and the school library established as a memorial. The aim of the thesis has been to show that school library provision is a great deal older than has generally been assumed, and that the reasons for which the school libraries have been established and maintained have changed but little over the centuries.</field><field name="date">1981</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2051/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2051/13/02Chapter1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2051/12/03Chapter2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2051/11/04Chapter3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2051/10/05Chapter4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2051/9/06Chapter5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2051/8/07Chapter6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2051/7/08Chapter7.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2051/6/09Chapter8.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2051/5/10Chapter9.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2051/4/11Conclusion.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2051/3/12Appendices.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2051/2/13Bibliography.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The functional morphology, systematics and behavioural ecology of parrotfishes (family Scaridae)</field><field name="creator">Bellwood , David Roy</field><field name="description">The functional morphology and behavioural ecology of the parrotfishes (family scaridae) were investigated to assess the degree of correlation between them. 
 
 Twenty-two species of parrotfishes from the subfamily Scarinae were examined mainly from reefs around Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia.
 
 Morphological studies of the osteology and myology of the heads of adult parrotfishes revealed two morphological groups within the genus Scarus, viz. the 'sordidus' and 'frenatus' groups. Species in the 'sordidus' group are characterized by: uneven cutting edges on the jaws, an entopterygoid lateral process, a tightly bound interdigitating maxilla and premaxilla, three rows of teeth on the upper pharyngeal bones, well developed adductor mandibulae sections, A2 and A3 and an additional unique muscle, the Awy. Species in the 'frenatus' group are characterized by: even cutting edges on the jaws, a slightly protrusible premaxilla, two rows of teeth on the upper pharyngeal bones, fusion of the abductor muscle section A1 and A2 in some species and a thin strap-like A3 section which inserts only on the articular. The morphology of the heads of species in other genera, namely, Cetoscarus bicolor, Bolbometopon muricatum and Hipposcarus Longiceps was marked by their possession of a quadrato mandibularis internus muscle and the non-articulatory articular-dentary joint in C. bicolor and B. muricatum.
 
 Analyses of the two morphological groups indicated a marked difference in the functional abilities of species in the two groups. The morphological characteristics of 'sordidus' group species enable them to bite the substratum with a large powerful cracking bite. Species in this group are therefore described as 'biters', The morphological characteristics of 'frenatus' group species are consistent with the requirements necessary for scraping substratum with small, weak bites. Species in this group are therefore described as 'scrapers'.
 
 Of the species examined in this study, the following species are functional &#8216;biters&#8217;: S. bleekert, S. gitbbus and S. sordidus, whereas the following are functional 'scrapers': S. brevifilis,, S. dimidiatus, S. ftavipectoralis, S. frenatus, S. ghobban S. globiceps, S. longipinnis, S. niger, S. oviceps, S. psittacus, S. rivulatus, S. rubroviolaceus, S. schlegeli, S. spinus, S. tricolor and Scarus sp. (cf. lunula). Because they lack some specialized morphological features associated with the biting or scraping strategies of species in the genus Scarus, Cetoscarus bicolor and Bolbometopon muricatum are considered 'proto-biters', whilst Hipposcarus longiceps is considered a 'proto-scraper'.
 
 These differences are not apparent in juvenile specimens less than 50 mm standard length. specimens of Scarus smaller than this are extremely similar. Small specimens(&lt; 14 mm S.L.), in particular, differ markedly from the adults in the possession of caniform teeth and a simple, non-sacculated intestine.
 
 Functional interpretations of the anatomy of the head and intestine of juvenile scarids suggest that they progress from an initial carnivorous phase to a selective grazing stage before becoming functional 'scrapers' at about 50 mm S.L.. 'Biting' species only possess the full complement of biting characteristics above 90 mm S.L.
 
 Field observations of adults revealed two feeding guilds within the genus Scarus which correspond with the two functional groups. (1) 'Biting' i.e. 'sordidus' group species are characterized by: i) infrequent, large bites which scar the Substratum, ii) a propensity to feed upon convex substrata, and iii) aggressive interspecific interactions, when displayed, predominantly directed towards other 'sordidus' group species. (2) 'scraping' i.e. 'frenatus' group species are characterized by: i) numerous small bites which rarely scar the substratum, ii) a tendency to feed on a range of substrata, and iii) aggressive interspecific interactions, when displayed, predominantly directed towards other 'frenatus' group species, These feeding strategies strongly influence the roles played by parrotfishes as coral predators and bioeroding agents. The major coral predator is Bolbometopon muricatum. Bioerosion is primarily the result of feeding by 'sordidus' group species, Cetoscarus bicolor and B. muricatum. It is therefore proposed that the distribution of these species within and between reefs may influence the extent and rates of bioerosion, the topography of the substratum and the distribution of various coral morphs.
 
 Field observations of juvenile scarids revealed a wide range of behavioural traits, although these did not correspond with the 'sordidus' and 'frenatus' groupings. S. frenatus in particular, differed from other juvenile 'frenatus' group species in its feeding behaviour. An analysis of the gut contents of the juveniles of several species showed marked changes in the diet, from being initially predominantly carnivorous to herbivorous. These changes were strongly correlated with changes in morphology and behaviour.
 
 In addition to functional considerations, the morphological analyses in this study were used to examine the systematic relationships between genera in the subfamily Scarinae. The present generic status of Cetoscarus, Bolbometopon and Hipposcarus is supported. The genus Scarus contains two distinct groups which may be recognized at the generic level. 
 
 A descriptive account of the ontogeny of the colour patterns of the juvenile phase of 22 species is presented to facilitate the study of juvenile scarids in the field. The colour patterns of juvenile scarids are interpreted in terms of concealment colouration, including crypticism, camouflage and mimicry. In the species examined, there is a strong correlation between schooling behaviour, the range of patterns displayed, and the speed with which the patterns may be changed.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2052/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2052/2/02Chapters1-3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2052/3/03Chapter4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2052/4/04chapter5-6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2052/5/05Appendices-Bibliography.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#8216;Our Way': social space and the geography of land allocation practice on the southern Gulf Lowlands of Cape York Peninsula</field><field name="creator">Monaghan, James</field><field name="description">This thesis reviews the geography of land allocation practice in Pormpuraaw and Kowanyama. The two communities are adjacent to each other on the southern Gulf Lowlands of Cape York Peninsula and their Aboriginal residents share many ties of kinship, though since their establishment in the earlier years of the 20th century they have had differing experiences of church mission and then State administration of their affairs. As with other rural Aboriginal communities in Queensland, their &#8216;Deed of Grant in Trust&#8217; or DOGIT title to community lands was transferred to locally elected Community councils in 1987. This was followed in the 1990s by the establishment of homelands or outstations by kin groups and their families in their traditional homeland country. A number of historically contingent as well as traditional protocols appear to have been used in the selection of these homeland sites.
 Community life is complex and the rationale that underlies decision-making on homeland allocation and land use issues is often difficult to elucidate in community land planning as decision-making can encapsulate criteria that are taken for granted and thus not referred to when people explain either their actions or aspirations. Bourdieu&#8217;s concept of &#8216;habitus&#8217; (1977, 1984) is used as a conceptual framework in this thesis to explore what I propose are the implicit or taken for granted and the explicit or declared properties of landscapes in the southern Gulf Lowlands in order to explain the geography of land allocation practice that prevails there in the early 21st century.
 Specifically, this thesis treats the historical and geographical interactions between the DOGIT tenure and the Aboriginal landscape, and the seasonal proximity of traditional country to the community township as core properties of implicit or unstated space. Explicit space is identified by the landmarks, places and personal geographies that people refer to when describing personal connections to traditional country or when reviewing community land management issues. My thesis is that at the convergence of these geographies there is a praxis which explains a large part of the diversity in land allocation practice on the southern Gulf Lowlands today.
 In order to develop and confirm my thesis I apply concepts of &#8216;social space&#8217; developed by Bourdieu (1977, 1984), Casey (1993, 2001), Lefebvre (1991) and Soja (1996) and their view that geographical space is not just a passive container of social relations but is a generative medium where social practice is actively reproduced. To this end, this thesis develops a series of cartographic models which use kinship models of social organisation and ethno-archaeological models of the spatial organisation of land use to project the properties of social space onto the physical spaces of the townscapes and landscapes of the southern Gulf Lowlands. The topology of social space is reproduced at three levels of emplacement in patterns of household residency in the townscape; in land use and homeland affiliation in the landscape, and in personal space and the daily life of personal relationships and of work and recreation. The relative congruence or disjuncture between these modeled spaces provide direct insights into processes that underlie the geography of land allocation practice in Kowanyama and Pormpuraaw.
 Differences in land allocation practice between Kowanyama and Pormpuraaw, which are identified in both the implicit and explicit properties of social space in each community, are complemented by a marked congruity between their respective mapped landscapes and townscapes. Local variations in practice are also identified in implicit space within each community, in landscape units that have their latency in either the seasonal properties of the Aboriginal landscape, the coincident mainstream DOGIT tenure or their proximity to the township.
 Explicit space is filled with a comprehensive knowledge of the environmental properties of the southern Gulf Lowlands that is referenced to geography of European and Aboriginal places and landmarks in the region. People used differing kinds of landmark knowledge, depending on their clan or tribe affiliation and their age or their life experiences, to describe their homeland country as well as the wider region. Everybody has their own personal suite of person- place &#8211; social space relationships that define their homeland, tribe or community affiliation. As a result of generational differences in landscape knowledge between people, there may be a variety of person-place-space topologies in any homeland group but they all refer to a common geographical space and shared identity. The social spaces which these topologies refer to are stable over time and present day homeland spaces correspond with those clan estates and tribal domains mapped by anthropologists in the 20th century. The underlying geometry of traditional country is immutable, as it is central to indigenous perceptions of social space in the southern Gulf Lowlands. It is only the suite of places or landmarks that people use to map themselves onto the landscape that changes over time. This geography is part of a continuous process of innovation and re-creation in southern Gulf Lowlands society. It is also the core spatial praxis that links implicit space and explicit space and reconciles local and introduced tenures in local land allocation practice.
 The primary motive for the maintenance of person-place-space relationships is the affirmation of Aboriginal identity. Social space is both egocentric and sociocentric. Any person may possess different assemblages of person-place-space relationships at homeland, tribal, community and regional scales of social aggregation. Hence, in principle each person may have their own unique &#8216;private geography&#8217; that enhances individuation and personal as well as social identity across all geographical scales of social space. This spatial praxis is part of a wide repertoire of strategies that is used by Aboriginal people to cope with mainstream Australia and the attendant roles that are occasionally placed on them as objects of academic research or policy-making or as service recipients. It appears, in the early years of the 21st century, that the geographies which were created by Aboriginal people as a result of 20th century colonisation of western Cape York Peninsula are very localised and specialised adaptations to local historical and geographical circumstances, and are unlikely to ever change again: if so, then this diversity and immutability have considerable implications for the future development of land policy in the region. This thesis concludes with a consideration of the unique roles that geography and cartography have in socially inclusive regional and community scale Aboriginal land planning in North Australia.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1284/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1284/2/02chapters1-4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1284/3/03chapters5-7.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1284/4/04references.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A response to the jurisprudence of the High Court in
 the &#8216;implied rights cases&#8217;: an autochthonous Australian
 constitution, popular sovereignty and individual rights?</field><field name="creator">Dillon, Anthony Matthew</field><field name="description">Parliamentary supremacy is a major and important principle of Australian constitutional
 law. Popular sovereignty, on the other hand, has come to occupy a confusing and possibly
 dangerous position in Australia's current constitutional arrangements. In the &#8216;implied rights
 cases&#8217;, popular sovereignty was said to replace (or at least heavily qualify) parliamentary
 supremacy, and was seen as a springboard for the protection of individual rights. This thesis
 argues that the promulgation and enforcement of individual rights chosen by the High
 Court, against a democratically elected parliament, should be seen as a massive
 appropriation of political power from parliaments to judges. This is of course not to say that
 the High Court has no role to play in the development of rights in constitutional law, but it
 is to say that this role should be exercised cautiously and with restraint, and with due
 deference to the expressed will of the people through their elected representatives. As a
 result, any notion of &#8216;extra-constitutional rights&#8217; not discerned from the text and structure of
 the Constitution, that might be said to limit parliamentary supremacy, should not be
 entertained. The broad traditions, including judicial deference to Parliament and separate
 roles of the legislature and the judiciary should be maintained, such that the enunciation of
 rights of general application should be left to parliaments.
 The Founders of the Australian Constitution instituted these broad traditions when they
 envisaged the institutional design and normative scheme of the Constitution. Such traditions
 were based on positivist and utilitarian notions, and also included the embracing of the
 doctrine of parliamentary supremacy and the specific rejection of a bill of rights. For the
 High Court to now show infidelity to the institutional design of the Founders would mean
 that the checks, balances and traditions envisaged by the Founders are subverted,
 potentially leading to a dysfunctional constitutional order. Moreover, it is argued this shift
 in the role of one of the key components of the federation can have a destabilising effect on
 the High Court itself, and no less the federation. For if Australia ever found itself in the
 midst of a constitutional crisis, Australians must be able to have utmost faith in the High
 Court as an apolitical institution to determine the validity of Australian laws.
 Since the passage of the Australia Acts in 1986, some Justices of the High Court have
 sought to imbue the Australian Constitution with a republican form of ideology to search
 for an autochthonous or 'home-grown' Constitution. It is said the traditional view of the
 legal basis of the Constitution being the United Kingdom Parliament, cannot support a
 popular ideological basis to the Constitution and emphasise individual rights. However, the
 fact that the United Kingdom Parliament can no longer legislate for Australia, does not
 necessarily mean the legal basis of the Constitution is now popular sovereignty. Nor does it
 follow that the withdrawal of the British hegemony or Australia&#8217;s lack of a bill of rights
 should sanction any greater role for the High Court.
 It is this discourse in the &#8216;implied rights cases&#8217; surrounding the legal basis of the
 Constitution and individual rights that this thesis takes up in detail. This thesis will
 deconstruct the elements of this discourse to show that it constitutes a pernicious challenge
 to orthodox methods of constitutional interpretation previously based upon the rule of law
 and the separation of powers. It will be argued that in the 'implied rights cases' the High
 Court was less concerned about trespassing upon parliament's traditional and separate role
 than it was in promulgating a new rights discourse for Australia. Whilst doing so, every
 effort has been made to state the law as at November 2004.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1291/4/Thesis_front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1291/3/Thesis_whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aunties in action: speaking louder than words: rural women developing social capital, women raising funds and spirits</field><field name="creator">Horn, Jennifer Frances</field><field name="description">&#8220;Aunties&#8221; are grassroots women who actively develop social capital by encouraging social trust and reciprocity to flourish; unfortunately, the voluntary contributions of aunties are often taken for granted and seldom included in discussions of social capital or community development. This study offers an important alternative perspective to the notion that unpaid social care provided by grassroots women is insignificant, and it counters the discourse of decline in civic participation that is dominant in many Western societies.
 From the data arose three themes to describe the experience of being an &#8220;auntie.&#8221; Specifically, aunties are particularly active in formal and informal aspects of society, aunties build relationships, connections, and networks; and they do this by creating common understandings amongst families, community members, and the professionals who serve them. In addition, aunties actively resist the social construction of women&#8217;s social caring as trivial, and they persist in countering discourses that diminish the capacities of rural people, their families, and communities. Some aunties perform small, individual, local acts of living and giving, such as helping a sick neighbour, while others are active in large, collective movements, at a national level, such as through Girl Guides or Country Women&#8217;s Associations.
 This hermeneutic phenomenological study is based on interviews conducted with ten selected women in Western Canada and Northeastern Australia, as well as on material and cultural artefacts, on photographic evidence I gathered of aunties in the vernacular, and on my own experiences as an auntie in several rural communities. Interpretation of the data was informed by social constructivist, feminist, heuristic, and response-base theories, through which I endeavoured to establish the locus of expertise with the participants as well as with the researcher.
 The actions of aunties are significant to the development of social capital because they build relationships and trust within the community, which in turn, can promote the development of social and economic capital. If local, grassroots community members have the opportunity to contribute to both formal and informal community development, then the capacity to create shared goals may lead to increased trust amongst locals and professional developers, and therefore enhance the community development process. When grassroots people and professionals arrive at a common understanding of the value of informal networks and activities to the survival of small communities, then the gap that divides public from private needs and desires may be more readily bridged. In addition, if those who reside in small, rural, or remote community contexts have the opportunity to build safe and trusting relationships with other locals and with the professionals that serve them, then misunderstandings may be avoided and the community development process may be more successful.
 Aunties contribute significantly to the development of informal networks and reciprocal relationships, and they engender social trust and warmth, which in turn increases the capacity of families, neighbourhoods, and communities to generate and accumulate social capital. Therefore, it is important to study the words and actions of aunties to learn who they are, what they do, and how they do it in order to support and encourage other people to likewise become active and engaged citizens.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1298/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1298/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation into long-range wireless sensor networks</field><field name="creator">Willis, Simon L.</field><field name="description">Advances in technology have allowed for the development of wireless sensor
 networks consisting of small autonomous sensor nodes that communicate with one
 another via wireless technology. Most designs of wireless sensor networks
 concentrate on miniaturisation where sensor nodes can only communicate over a short
 distance and must be closely positioned to monitor an area. In contrast, this thesis
 presents a long-range wireless sensor network where nodes are separated by large
 distances, giving the advantage of being able to monitor a large geographic area.
 
 The long-range communications capability allows the sensor network to monitor
 environmental conditions over a large area. This technology has practical agricultural
 applications such as monitoring the level of water in cattle feeding troughs or
 monitoring soil moisture to ensure that irrigation is conducted efficiently. The sensor
 network can also be deployed on the Great Barrier Reef to constantly monitor the
 water quality.
 
 The design of the long-range wireless sensor network emerged from a long-range
 radio propagation model developed particularly for this application. This model was
 used to develop the specification for the radio transceiver hardware which was later
 developed and integrated with a commonly-used node called the Mote. A CSMA/CA
 (carrier-sense, multiple access with collision avoidance) MAC (Medium Access
 Control) protocol and a routing protocol were then selected for use on a four-node
 prototype network which was deployed across Townsville for field-testing.
 
 The results of field-testing showed that a long-range ad-hoc network was formed and
 the maximum operational wireless link was 13.2 km long. This project shows that it is

The response of scleractinian corals to damage is dependent on the nature and extent of damage, the characteristics of the injury, the life-histories of the coral, and the prevailing abiotic and biotic conditions. In this thesis I have examined several aspects of injury including (1) the nature and extent of natural injury, (2) the response of corals to injuries with different characteristics and (3) the influence of morphology and life-history in response to damage.
 
 The spatial and temporal patterns of coral injury were recorded to determine the nature and extent of damage in common reef-crest corals at Lizard Island. The total amount of partial mortality on reef-crest corals was low (&lt;2%) although there was a three-fold difference among sites. Sites with low partial mortality had reef-crest assemblages dominated (both numerically and in cover) by tabular and bushy corals. These corals have low levels of partial mortality, and on average, fewer small colonies with injuries. Conversely, the site where the partial mortality was three times higher had a lower abundance and cover of tabular corals, and an increase in the number and cover of massive and digitate corals. Massive and digitate corals, on average, have a higher amount of partial mortality and more small colonies with injuries.
 
 
 The amount of injury present on a colony at a particular time is a balance between vulnerability (i.e. frequency of injury and resilience to damage) and recovery rate. An investigation into the patterns of injury over time showed that vulnerability to damage and recovery of injuries was species specific. In general Goniastrea retiformis had a high number of old injuries, a slow regeneration rate, and was injured infrequently, suggesting that injuries tended to accumulate on colonies over time. The addition of new injuries was also low for Acropora gemmifera, however colonies had few pre-existing injuries and faster recovery rates, reducing the accumulation of injuries on colonies. The injury dynamics for A. hyacinthus differed between censuses because of a change in injury regimes from routine to catastrophic, the latter regime caused by an outbreak of Acanthaster planci. Under routine conditions, there were few pre-existing injuries on colonies, a moderate addition of new injuries, and rapid regeneration, suggesting a fast turn-over of injuries. Under catastrophic conditions, there were many more pre-existing injuries, a high number of new injuries, and more injuries increasing in size than recovering, resulting in an accumulation of injuries.
 
 
 The regeneration of injuries was influenced by the characteristics of the injury including initial size, type, and position within the colony The complete regeneration of an injury was more probable for small injuries (0 - 4 cm2) than larger injuries. However, recovery rates were also dependent on the type of injury as scraping injuries had a much faster regeneration rate than tissue mortality or breakage. Additionally, recovery was influenced by the position of injuries within colonies for one species Porites mayeri where the rate of regeneration of central injuries was greater than edge injuries. Conversely, the recovery of central and edge injuries was similar for A. robusta, A. hyacinthus, A. palifera, Pocillopora damicornis, and Porites lichen. Variations in levels of partial mortality, zones of tissue from which regeneration can take place, degrees of settlement by other organisms, intensities of damage, and amounts of resources available for regeneration all contributed to the differences in recovery rates found between injuries with varying characteristics.
 
 
 The regeneration of injuries requires resources that are in limited supply. In this study, there was a marked effect of injury on reproduction for A. hyacinthus, A. gemmifera and G. retiformis, inferring a trade-off between reproduction and regeneration. Presumably the resources usually available for gamete production are being reallocated towards polyp regrowth and defence against fouling organisms. In contrast, injury had no effect on the survival or growth of colonies over nine months for the three species. This result suggests that future reproduction is being preserved through the iteration of new polyps but at the expense of current reproduction. It also suggests that these species are resistant to damage since their survival was unaltered by damage in the short-term.
 
 
 Species resistant to damage have evolved two alternative, but not mutually exclusive, strategies in response to injury. Corals can invest resources in defensive mechanisms to avoid damage (avoidance strategies) or regrow lost parts after injury has occurred (tolerance strategies). Both strategies were utilised by corals in this study, although the amount of investment in either strategy varied. Generally, the longer-lived species, G. retiformis and A. gemmifera, seemed to invest more resources towards defence than the shorter-lived A. hyacinthus since the number of new injuries present on colonies was higher for the latter species. Conversely, the shorter-lived coral invested more in tolerance strategies by responding to infrequent damage events or minimal tissue losses with rapid regrowth. The cost of such a strategy is that shorter-lived species are more vulnerable to repetitive injury.
 
 
 Experimental studies showed that branching species had more regrowth potential than massive and semi-massive species supporting the hypothesis by Jackson (1979) that morphology plays a role in the pattern of investment in regeneration and defence. The morphology of a coral influences its longevity, reproductive output, growth rate, and other life-history processes including regeneration. Consequently, the morphological strategy of an organism has evolved over time in response to a large number of biotic and abiotic processes including partial mortality.
 
 
 In conclusion, this study on injury and regeneration of scleractinian corals has increased our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms that affect the recovery of corals from damage, and has provided a basis for understanding the consequences of different injury regimes on coral reefs. This is important because injury can adversely affect corals at the individual, population and community level and thus impact on the general ecology of coral reefs.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/8/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/8/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tectonic, magmatic and metallogenic evolution of the Cajamarca mining district, Northern Peru</field><field name="creator">Davies, Richard C I</field><field name="description">In the Cajamarca region of northern Peru periods of peak Tertiary magmatism
 had a close association with orogenic episodes and high plate convergence rates. New
 40Ar/39Ar dates show magmatism in the region had commenced by late Palaeocene
 times, some 15 m.y. earlier than suggested by previous geochronological studies.
 Palaeogene (57-43 Ma) intrusive and volcanic rocks are intermediate in composition
 with flat REE profiles and primitive isotope compositions. These magmas were derived
 from an immature sub-Andean mantle dominated by pyroxene and olivine. This
 magmatic interval coincided with development of an early fold-thrust fabric in
 deformed sedimentary rocks.
 Early Miocene onset of high plate convergence rates triggered the generation of
 oxidised hydrous melts from the breakdown of a sub-Andean amphibole-rich upper
 mantle to lower crust. These melts rose into large magma ponds deep within the crust.
 Sr, Nd and Pb isotope compositions indicate synmineralisation magmas and metals
 were derived from a common deep source and that magmas underwent minimal upper
 crustal contamination. During brief changes in the tectonic stress, primitive hydrousrich
 magmas were released from these chambers and ascended rapidly along deeply
 tapping faults. Dioritic intrusions with HREE-depleted profiles were emplaced during
 periods of extension in a highly fractured upper crust. New 40Ar/39Ar dates indicate this
 occurred from 23.2 to 16.5 Ma. Mineralised stocks are commonly located in the
 hanging wall of a regional thrust fault and situated at structural intersections, such as
 oblique secondary structures superimposed on pre-existing regional-scale faults.
 Mineralisation-controlling structures, e.g. fault, vein and fracture arrays, at the porphyry
 deposits have subparallel NNW and NE-NNE trends that suggest they were directly
 controlled by a regionally extensive stress regime. The physiochemical conditions that
 prevailed during early stage hypogene mineralisation strongly influenced the Au
 enrichment at the various porphyry deposits. Au-rich deposits are typically hosted in
 carbonates, tend to have well-developed potassic alteration zones, high temperature and
 oxygen fugacity hypogene sulphide mineral assemblages (bornite + chalcopyrite) and
 abundant hydrothermal magnetite. In contrast, mineralised stocks in contact with
 fractured quartzites &#177; carbonates are Cu-Au-Mo deposits with lower temperature hypogene sulphide assemblages of chalcopyrite and pyrite, and potassic alteration zones
 overprinted by low-grade pyritic phyllic alteration.
 Late Miocene high-sulphidation deposits (~11 Ma) near Cajamarca formed
 during the cessation of intense crustal thickening and uplift that was associated with
 shallowing of the slab dip angle. Location of ore bodies at the Yanacocha mine was
 largely controlled by WNW structures, indicating rotation of the dominant fault
 orientation from NNE-NNW to WNW with time. A mineralised dioritic-tonalitic
 intrusion beneath the Yanacocha high-sulphidation system has a steep HREE-depleted
 profile and more evolved radiogenic Sr-Nd isotope compositions than the early Miocene
 intrusions. However, a pyrite Pb isotope composition from this intrusion is significantly
 less radiogenic than sulphides from early Miocene deposits. These features indicate late
 Miocene magmas were formed beneath a thickened crust, similar to that at the present
 day, and require a higher garnet content in the source.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/10/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/10/2/02sectionA.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/10/3/03sectionB.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/10/4/04sectionC.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/10/5/05sectionD.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/10/6/06sectionE.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/10/7/07bibliography.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/10/8/08appendicesA-C.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/10/9/09appendixD.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Graffiti on the wall: reading history through news media: the role of news media in historical crises, in the case of the collapse of the Eastern bloc in Europe 1989.</field><field name="creator">Duffield, Lee R.</field><field name="description">The thesis reviews the engagement of news media in the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe in 1989, most vividly represented by the opening of the Berlin Wall.

 feminism in the contemporary socio-political context. It brings a feminist analysis to new
 social theories about late modernity by exploring the particular relationship that young
 women have to the social and psychological processes that are associated with this
 reconfigured climate and the prevailing ideology of neo-liberalism.
 A feminist theoretical framework informs all features of the research. It underpins the
 justification and context for the area of inquiry, the choice of methodology, the use of
 methods and the analytical lens for the interpretation of literature and data. The research
 employs a qualitative methodology. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews
 with fifty five young women aged between eighteen and twenty five. The participants all
 resided in the Townsville/Thuringowa area and represented diversity in terms of race, class,
 sexuality, parenting status and education.
 The growing influence of neo-liberalism and its dovetailing with feminism has ushered in the
 concept of a modernised, assertive and liberated femininity which celebrates the democratic
 opening up of choices and unprecedented options for girls and women, particularly in the
 areas of education and employment. The findings presented in this thesis identify that being
 female in these conditions is not to experience a simple and unproblematic expansion of
 choice or liberation from previous constraint, rather that they entail &#8216;difficult freedoms&#8217;.
 Whilst the vast majority of participants report the benefits of these changes and a belief in
 meritocracy, their experiences and opportunities are strongly mediated by race, class and
 educational experience, and significantly complicated by primary responsibility for parenting
 and domestic work. The research found the continuation of many material barriers and
 circumscriptions in the areas of education, occupational preference, mothering and
 domesticity and a high incidence of male violence in intimate relationships and family
 backgrounds. Inequalities that are generated socially are overwhelmingly understood by
 young women through a &#8216;politics of choice&#8217;. A punitive interpretive framework of
 individualism is strongly endorsed and this is reflected in their assessment of feminism. This
 study identifies subjective adjustments to this epistemological leaning which include
 techniques of discounting or distancing themselves from negative interpretations of their own
 disadvantage or adversity and the relational consequences of resentment and a chilling of
 empathy towards others in hardship.
 The thesis concludes that young women are located in a changed context of power. The
 hegemonic operation of neo-liberalism allows subordination to occur covertly within a
 framework of ostensible commitment to equality, the valorisation of choice and through
 seductive incitements to individual responsibility and self-management. Liberating processes
 which are supposed to be freeing for women are actually involved in re-inscribing their
 subordinate status. The research contributes to contemporary feminist theory and activism
 and to social policy and welfare practice by restating the relevance of structural perspectives
 and signalling the necessity of incorporating knowledge of the epistemological and subjective
 dispositions outlined in this research.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/12/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/12/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fundamentalism and structural development: A conceptual synthesis and discussion of implications for religious education</field><field name="creator">Adam, Raoul J.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines religious fundamentalism in light of structural-developmental theory. Reciprocally, it provides a critique of the structural-developmental approach in light of its application to religious fundamentalism. The product is a conceptual synthesis between observed fundamentalist characteristics and the evolving tradition of developmentalism. The findings of this conceptual synthesis are used to generate principles for developmentally sensitive religious education. The thesis focusses on Protestant Christian Fundamentalism while utilising illustrative examples from diverse faith traditions described in current literature as fundamentalist.Findings revealed general congruency between early developmental structures and elements of fundamentalism. The contents and dynamics of fundamentalism resist the development of later stage structures. Hence, ontogenetic development is affected by the phylogenetic structure of the fundamentalist discourse; cultures can reflect stage-specific structuring tendencies and therefore affect individual development. Stage crises and transitions provide a powerful interpretive model for the dynamics of interaction between fundamentalism and other discourses. The analysis revealed the potential for a form of recapitulated fundamentalism prompted by dissonance between convergent epistemologies and emerging divergent epistemologies of later development. This suggests that purely content-based assessments of fundamentalism may not account for its developmental range.
 The recapitulation of fundamentalism and its appearance in phylogenetic forms challenges traditional developmental assumptions concerning stage progression. It provides a rationale for further investigation of the structuring powers of contents within the developmental discourse. This investigation necessitates the integration of concepts including compartmentalisation, cognitive dissonance and consonance into the structural developmental model.
 The thesis offers a theoretical defense of facilitated development beyond fundamentalism as a structural developmental representation. It proposes broad principles for the facilitation of such development in the context of schooled religious education. These principles of a developmentally sensitive religious education are holistic, dynamic, progressive, experiential, interpersonal, intrapersonal, meta-contextual, objectified and critically reflective.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/13/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/13/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The population genetic structure of coral reef fishes on the
 Great Barrier Reef</field><field name="creator">Bay, Line Kolind</field><field name="description">The population genetic structure of species may be determined by complex interactions
 among many ecological, evolutionary and genetic processes. I investigated the
 population genetic structure of coral reef fishes on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR),
 Australia to better understand how these various processes may interact in a natural
 system. I firstly examined the spatial genetic structure of a low dispersal species to
 determine if its genetic structure varied among spatial scales and among regions located
 in the centre and on the periphery of its distributional range. I then examined the
 population genetic structure of species with different dispersal potentials and among
 species sampled at central and peripheral locations in their species range.
 Using mtDNA control region sequences and three microsatellite loci, I examined
 the spatial genetic structure of a direct developing coral reef fish, Acanthochromis
 polyacanthus, with comparatively low dispersal rates. The spatial genetic structure of
 this species was scale-dependent with evidence of isolation-by-distance among regions,
 but not within regions. Very strong genetic structure was detected among reefs within
 regions consistent with a metapopulation model. Pairwise genetic distances increased
 from offshore and older populations, to inshore and younger ones, supporting a
 metapopulation propagule-pool model of colonisation. Genetic diversities, mismatch,
 and coalescence analyses all identified large variation in the demographic history of this
 species among populations and regions. Evidence of genetic bottlenecks was detected
 by mismatch analysis in the majority of populations sampled, but in most populations
 these bottlenecks appeared to be older since genetic diversities and coalescence based
 population growth estimates did not indicate recent genetic bottlenecks. In contrast,
 three populations displayed low genetic diversities and large population growth rates
 indicating a more recent genetic bottleneck. Reductions in genetic diversities of local
 populations resulted in overall lower genetic diversity and a higher regional expansion
 rate in the southern region located towards the distributional margin of this species. In
 all, these results suggest that A. polyacanthus exists as a metapopulation within regions
 on the GBR and that metapopulation dynamics may differ among regions located in the
 centre and on the periphery of this species.
 The pelagic larval duration (PLD) can both affect and record the ecology and
 evolution of coral reef fishes and emerging evidence suggests that this trait displays
 considerable intraspecific variation. Here I present new estimates of PLD for ten species
 of Pomacentridae and two species of Gobiidae, and coupled with previously published
 estimates, examine spatial and temporal variation of PLDs within and among these
 species. In eight of the twelve species examined here, within-population mean PLDs
 differed between sampling times, locations within regions, and among regions. In
 contrast, the range of these same PLD estimates overlapped at all spatial and temporal
 scales examined in eleven of the twelve species, but not between regions in one species
 (Amphiprion melanopus). Therefore, despite tight error estimates typically associated
 with estimates of PLD taken from a particular population at a particular time in some
 taxa, the overlapping ranges in PLD reported here indicate that the length of the pelagic
 larval phase is a much more plastic trait than previously appreciated.
 Pelagic larval duration (PLD) is a commonly used proxy for dispersal potential
 in coral reef fishes. Here I examine the relationship between PLD, genetic structure and
 genetic variability in coral reef fishes from one family (Pomacentridae) that differ in
 mean larval duration by more than a month. Genetic structure was estimated in eight
 species using a mitochondrial molecular marker (control region) and in a sub-set of five
 species using nuclear molecular markers (ISSRs). Estimates of genetic differentiation
 were similar among species with pelagic larvae, but differed between molecular
 markers. The mtDNA indicated no structure while the ISSR indicated some structure
 between the sampling locations. I detected a relationship between PLD and genetic
 structure using both markers. These relationships, however, were caused by a single
 species, Acanthochromis polyacanthus, which differs from all the other species
 examined here in lacking a larval phase. With this species excluded, there was no
 relationship between PLD and genetic structure using either marker. Genetic diversities
 were generally high in all species and did not differ significantly among species and
 locations. Nucleotide diversity and total heterozygosity were negatively related to
 maximum PLD, but again, these relationships were caused by A. polyacanthus and
 disappeared when this species was excluded from these analyses. These genetic patterns
 are consistent with moderate gene flow among well-connected locations and indicate
 that at this phylogenetic level (i.e., within family) the duration of the pelagic larval
 phase is not the primary factor affecting patterns of genetic differentiation.
 Using mtDNA (control region) and nuclear (ISSR) markers, I investigated the
 population genetic structure of three congeneric species pairs of pomacentrid coral reef
 fishes (Pomacentridae) in the context of species&#8217; borders theory. This theory predicts that population located on the periphery of the species&#8217; range should be smaller and
 more fragmented and hence, display stronger genetic structure and lower genetic
 diversities compared to more centrally located populations. Each species pair consisted
 of one species sampled at two central locations within its geographic range, and another
 species sampled at the same locations but which constituted one location toward the
 centre of its range and another close to its edge. Contrary to expectations from theory, I
 did not find the predicted border effects in the population genetic structure of the
 species examined. Gene flow estimates did not differ among central and peripheral
 species. Genetic diversities were not lower in peripheral populations compared to
 central populations or in species sampled towards the periphery compared to those
 sampled in the centre of their ranges. Indeed, genetic diversities were much greater in
 the peripheral species compared to their central counterparts. The distribution of genetic
 variation indicated that secondary contact among differentiated lineages may, in part, be
 responsible for the high genetic diversity in these peripheral species. Elevated mutation
 rates mediated by environmental stress on the species&#8217; margin may have contributed
 further genetic variability in these species.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/14/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/14/2/02chapter1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/14/3/03chapter2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/14/4/04chapter3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/14/5/05chapter4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/14/6/06chapter5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/14/7/07chapter6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/14/8/08chapter7.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/14/9/09bibliography.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/14/10/10appendix.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling sub-reef thermodynamics to predict coral bleaching: a case study at Scott Reef, WA</field><field name="creator">Bird, James C.</field><field name="description">Coral bleaching occurs when corals become stressed, which typically occurs during periods of elevated water temperatures. If water temperatures remain elevated for a
 sufficient length of time, the corals often die. Coral bleaching affects reefs around the world and the recent increase in the frequency and severity of bleaching episodes has raised considerable concern. A clear understanding of the physics that elevate water temperatures may improve coral bleaching predictions and lead to more effective reef management. Currently, the best
 method to detect bleaching-like conditions is through a time integration of sea surface temperatures observed by satellite. Unfortunately, these observations only reveal the thermal structure for the top millimetre of water averaged over large areas (presently 2500 km2). The aim of this study is to use environmental physics to predict water
 temperatures at the reef and sub-reef scales. The study then goes a step further and translates these thermodynamic models into bleaching predictions.
 Simulations are run using atmospheric and oceanographic data from Scott Reef, a 40 km-wide atoll 300 km off the northwest coast of Australia. Scott Reef presents an ideal
 test site as it experienced a severe bleaching event in 1998 that was well documented. Averaged coral cover in exposed sites dropped from 54% to less than 10% over the top 30 metres. Additionally, the bathymetry around Scott Reef has been thoroughly surveyed and in 2003 an extensive array of oceanographic instruments was deployed for
 three months at strategic locations. A one-dimensional turbulence model is used to determine the vertical temperature structure of the water column around Scott Reef. Scott Reef is in a data-sparse region
 so that all of the heat fluxes have to be estimated from atmospheric conditions recorded at distant weather stations. The model results are verified with the 2003 field data. By driving the model with the appropriate atmospheric conditions, the simulated temperature profiles match the field observations. The model is next used to hindcast the temperature profiles during the 1998 bleaching event. Simulations indicate that anomalously-warm water most likely reached depths of 30 metres, a result that supports the claim that the deep bleaching was due to thermal stress. Field observations confirm that water currents around Scott Reef are predominantly
 tidal. Additionally, the observations demonstrate that the upper layers of certain regions within Scott Reef cool during strong tides. This finding is characteristic of tidal cooling, a common phenomenon where tides mix cooler, deeper water with warmer surface water.
 A map of sub-reef regions at Scott Reef that might experience tidal cooling is revealed by the numerical modelling. In a novel approach, stratified waters from the vertical model can be well-mixed in zones identified by a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model. There is a strong correlation between areas where bleached corals survived and locations that are predicted to have access to cooler well-mixed deep waters. The techniques used in this work are applicable to other reef systems. Therefore the
 results in this thesis are significant as they improve two aspects of coral bleaching prediction. First, the methods can determine if coral at different depths are at risk of
 bleaching. Second, the methods can distinguish regions within individual reefs that are more susceptible to coral bleaching.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/19/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/19/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Challenging the orthodoxy : an alternative strategy for the tertiary teaching of piano.</field><field name="creator">Daniel, Ryan J.</field><field name="description">This thesis outlines the rationale for and development of a small group piano teaching model for application in the Australian higher education environment.

Alternatively, the study of extragalactic SNRs offers a unique opportunity to examine them at a relatively known distance without Galactic plane interference. Here, I present multi-frequency identification and analysis of radio SNRs and their local environments in the direction of NGC 300 and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Using both Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) and Very Long Array observations, 18 radio SNRs (with 3 radio candidate SNRs and one microquasar candidate) were identified in NGC 300 based on selection criteria including spectral index and cross identification with optical and X-ray sources. X-ray co-identifications include those found in newly reduced data from the XMM-Newton archive and use of X-ray spectral models and hardness ratios. Five of these 18 radio remnants are associated with reported optical remnants, 3 have X-ray counterparts and 12 are found in archived [S ii] images. The 1.374 GHz luminosity function suggests that only the brightest SNRs are seen and correlations with OB associations or H ii regions suggest they originate within star forming regions. In the SMC, multi-wavelength identification criteria identified a total of 21 radio SNRs (16 known and 5 new candidates). Out of a total of 717 SMC radio sources found using the ATCA, 71 are classified as H ii regions, 616 as background objects, 2 as microquasar candidates and 2 as planetary nebulae. Follow-up optical spectra also confirmed one of the radio candidates as an SNR. Statistics for SNRs, H ii regions and background objects are presented for both galaxies; extensively for the SMC. These statistics suggest that for this mature population of remnants, radio brightness and density/abundance-sensitive optical spectral line intensities are not directly related to diameter, but rather reflect the local interstellar environment. An average of their 'metal&#8217;abundances (10&#8722;4.1), based on these optical line intensities, agree with those previously reported for the SMC, obtained by other methods. Observations of extragalactic SNRs reflect both their nature (progenitor) and their nurture (environment) since in the evolution of their life cycle, the two cannot be separated.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2106/3/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2106/4/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Copper electrodeposition in the presence of guar or activated polyacrylamide</field><field name="creator">Fabian, Cesimiro P.</field><field name="description">In the copper electrodeposition industry, it is essential to dose very small
 concentrations of additives including chloride ions to control the physical and chemical
 properties of the copper deposit. It is also widely recognized in the industry that the
 adsorption of these additives at electrode surfaces significantly influences the currentpotential
 relationships. This thesis presents the development of a new organic additive
 for copper electrowinning and electrorefining. This thesis also presents the comparison
 between the new organic additive &#8216;activated polyacrylamide&#8217; and Guartec (Guar), the
 industry-standard organic additive for electrowinning under industrial conditions.
 The first half of the thesis presents the results of bulk electrolysis experiments
 using either a rotating cylinder electrode (RCE) or parallel plate electrodes. The RCE
 was selected since it yields an uniform current distribution. In these experiments, the
 effectiveness of both organic additives in the presence of chloride ions was determined
 by directly measuring the surface roughness of the copper deposit. The second half
 presents Cyclic Voltammetry and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy data using
 a rotating cylinder electrode to measure and quantify the behaviour of Guar and APAM
 at the electrolyte/electrode interface also in the presence of chloride ions.
 It has been found from the literature review that polyacrylamide hydrolysis in
 weakly acidic solutions produces block copolymers. The diffusion layer thickness was
 determined from experimental limiting current density data. In this thesis/work, a 15million Dalton molecular weight polyacrylamide was dissolved in full-strength
 electrolyte (Cu, 36g/L; H2SO4, 160 g/L and chloride ions, 25mg/L) and in solutions
 with systematically halved concentrations, and in water and alkaline solutions at 50oC
 for two hours under stirring. The effect of the preparation media of polyacrylamide was
 tested by measuring the surface roughness of the copper deposits obtained after 6-hours
 electrowinning at 50oC using a rotating cylinder electrode. The statistically significant
 lowest surface roughness (6.59&#956;m &#177; 0.49) was obtained when polyacrylamide was
 prepared in 16-fold diluted electrolyte (10g/L sulfuric acid and 2.25g/L cupric ions and
 1.56mg/L chloride ions). The chemical structure of the polyacrylamide was examined
 after the preparation in 16-fold electrolyte using NMR. The NMR indicated that less
 than 10% of the non-ionic polyacrylamide was hydrolysed and it appears to consist of a
 block copolymer of polyacrylamide and polyacrylic acid. The new organic additive was
 named activated polyacrylamide (APAM)1.
 A comprehensive study on the effect of Guarfloc66 (Guar), the 40-year-old
 industry-standard organic additive, on copper electrowinning was lacking prior to this
 thesis. Guar was used as a basis against which to compare the effectiveness of APAM.
 This study provides an industrial-relevant baseline against which the new
 additive was compared. Therefore, the fundamental processes occurring at the stainless
 steel/copper metal-electrolyte interface in the presence and absence of Guar and APAM
 were investigated. Fractional factorial experimental designs for copper electrowinning
 (EW) were conducted in which the effect of current density, temperature, diffusion layer
 thickness, Guar and APAM on surface roughness was studied. The evolution of
 dendrite formation was evaluated using Peaks-per-Centimeter and surface roughness.
 These above tests were verified by experimental design tests up to 12-hours EW time.
 The overall results indicated that a more uniform surface and lower roughness was
 obtained using APAM than Guar.
 Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to understand the polarization behaviour of
 Guar and APAM at the interface of the copper electrolyte/copper cathode. Cyclic voltammetry tests on the ageing of 2mg/L Guar in the electrolyte at 45oC indicated that
 Guar depolarized the electrode. At 300A/m2 current density about 14mV maximum
 depolarization was obtained at 2-3 hours residence time whether the working electrode
 was stainless steel or freshly pre-plated copper metal. In contrast, CV tests showed that
 the presence of 2mg/L APAM polarized the electrode at 45oC and 65oC. At 300A/m2
 current density and 45oC the presence of APAM resulted in a significant polarization of
 the electrode on pre-plated copper over a 5-hour period, i.e., 13 mV at 5-hours residence
 time. This polarization value at 65oC was achieved after 1-hour residence time and the
 electrode remains significantly polarized over a 7-hour period.
 Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) tests were also conducted to
 characterize the electrode processes in the presence and absence of Guar and APAM.
 The electrochemical kinetics of the process was evaluated in terms of the chargetransfer
 resistance (or polarization resistance) and the double-layer capacitance. The
 electrochemical system of copper deposition in the presence and absence of Guar and
 APAM is described theoretically in terms of an equivalent circuit. The EIS
 experimental data was fitted to the equivalent circuit using complex nonlinear leastsquares
 (CNLS) technique with LEVM and ZSimpWin&#8482; software packages. The
 electrode process in the presence of Guar or APAM was quantitatively characterized
 using the high frequency loop only since it represents the kinetic control of the process.
 The low frequency loop that represents the mass-transfer control was used qualitatively
 only.
 EIS tests indicate that Guar decreased the charge-transfer resistance values
 obtained from equivalent circuit modelling from about 0.83ohm.cm2 in its absence to
 0.74ohm.cm2 at 2mg/L, -490mV versus the Hg/Hg2SO4 saturated in K2SO4, (MSE) for
 about 5-hours therefore increasing the electrochemical kinetics. The maximum
 reduction was determined to be 0.086ohm.cm2 at 2-3hours residence time of Guar in the
 electrolyte. Therefore, electrowinning using the RCE, CV and EIS indicated that the
 role of Guar during the deposition process is to act as a depolarizer.
 The presence of APAM in the electrolyte, in contrast, indicated that the chargetransfer
 resistance increased from about 0.79-ohm.cm2 to 1-ohm.cm2 for over 7-hours at
 45oC and -490mV vs. MSE. The maximum increase in the charge-transfer resistance value was 0.23-ohm.cm2 at 3-5hours residence time. These set of tests with APAM
 were also repeated at -470mV vs. MSE and 45oC, the results also indicated that APAM
 increased the charge-transfer resistance under these conditions. At this potential, a
 maximum increase of 0.42-ohm.cm2 was determined at 3-5hours. When these tests
 were also repeated at electrorefining temperature (65oC) and -445mV vs. MSE, the
 presence of APAM in the electrolyte also increased the charge-transfer resistance from
 about 0.39 up to 0.69-ohm.cm2 for over 5-hours. The maximum increase of 0.34-
 ohm.cm2 was at 2-hours for 65oC. Electrowinning tests using the RCE, CV and EIS
 overall results with APAM were found to be consistent. In summary, APAM was found
 to decrease the electrochemical kinetics and that the role of APAM is as a levelling
 agent during the deposition process.
 Guar and APAM decreased the double-layer capacitance but the equivalent
 circuit simulation data indicated that while the maximum reduction for Guar was 0.46 x
 10-5 &#956;F/cm2, the maximum reduction for APAM was 1.2 x 10-5 &#956;F/cm2 at 45oC and 6.8
 x 10-5 &#956;F/cm2 at 65oC. The overall EIS results may indicate that APAM is adsorbed
 more specifically than Guar.
 It was also shown that the effect of temperature on the ageing sequence of
 APAM is consistent with reaction kinetics, i.e., it is faster at 65oC than at 45oC as would
 be expected. Results were presented for the rotating disc electrode (RDE) also. The
 EIS data at 65oC and 45oC are consistent with the CV data whether the RCE or RDE
 was used. However, the EIS data with the RDE was not amenable to being modelled
 using the most commonly referred equivalent circuit for electrochemical systems.
 Bench-scale continuous electrowinning tests using parallel plate electrodes
 where APAM and Guar were also dosed continuously and independently also indicated
 that APAM produces smoother deposits than Guar. The cross sections of the copper
 deposits were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and showed that
 Guar produced porous deposits and APAM produced slightly columnar deposits.
 It is therefore concluded that the results of electrowinning, CV and EIS tests
 correlate: Guar depolarizes the electrode enhancing depolarization of the electrode by
 chloride ions and therefore increasing the growth rate with simultaneous formation of voids and porosity. APAM polarizes the electrode or decreases the rate of the
 deposition process and therefore assists the nucleation rate and produces purer copper
 deposits. Voids and porosity are probably reduced by the continuous formation of
 crystallites and their coalescence as indicated by x-ray diffraction data. The overall
 results indicate that APAM is more specifically adsorbed than Guar at the
 electrolyte/copper-metal interface and APAM acts as a levelling agent.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/29/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/29/2/02chapters1-3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/29/3/03chapter4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/29/4/04chapters5-7.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/29/5/05appendices.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shade tolerance of tropical forage legumes for use in agroforestry systems</field><field name="creator">Addison, H.J.</field><field name="description">The benefits of raising livestock in conjunction with tree plantations include the better use of land resources, an increased and diversified income, soil stabilisation and the potential for higher plantation yields through better weed control, nutrient cycling and nitrogen accretion. However, the significant acceptance of tree-pasture (silvopastoral) systems has been impeded by the belief that productive pasture cannot be maintained under tree canopies.
 The aims of this project were to identify forage legume species suitable for use in silvopastoral systems in order to improve pasture quality under differing rainfall regimes in the tropics. A total of 35 species and cultivars of tropical pasture legumes were tested for shade tolerance beneath four levels of shade under shadehouse conditions, with a range of agronomic and ecophysiological parameters measured, including biomass production, root:shoot ratio, root nodulation, foliar nutrient content, time to flowering, seed production and light response curves.
 Production of both above and below-ground biomass was strongly depressed by shading, although the extent of this varied between species. Many of the most promising species yielded well under both the control and the shaded treatments, indicating that they may be suitable for use in both younger, less shaded plantations and older, heavily shaded plantations. Concentrations of leaf N were affected by shading with increased N found under shade treatments compared to the control. There were no similar effects on leaf P concentrations. Root nodulation was strongly affected by shading and was greatly reduced or entirely absent under shaded treatments, suggesting that fixation of atmospheric nitrogen may be lower under shade than in the open. Shading prolonged the vegetative growth in many species, delaying flowering and greatly reducing seed production, although the size of individual seeds was maintained at the expense of seed numbers. An increase in the fraction of readily germinable seed and a decrease in the fraction of hard seed were found in several species when the seed was produced under shade under shade. Light curves were not always correlated, with the production of dry matter with several species that appear shade-tolerant from dry matter production producing light response curves suggesting otherwise.Field trials were conducted in both the wet and seasonally dry tropics to examine the growth of selected legume species under timber plantations that were already established for a number of years, and under a relatively young Nelder wheel plantation of African Mahogany (Khaya senegalensis). Field trials, particularly the Nelder wheel trial, demonstrated the dynamic nature of pasture growth, particularly in the seasonally dry tropics, and the need for continuous monitoring of such trials to form a more complete picture. Arachis pintoi was clearly the best performing species unde a five-year-old mixed rainforest species/Eucalyptus pellita plantation in the wet tropics. In the seasonally dry tropics Clitoria ternatea and Centrosema brasilianum proved to be the best performing cultivars beneath both a conventional, 12-year-old African Mahogany stand and the Nelder wheel, with pasture production depressed by increasing tree densities. Pasture production was found to decrease exponentially with increasing tree density in the Nelder wheel plantation. Both Clitoria ternatea and Centrosema brasilianum were observed to climb trees during the trial, indicating the potential of vigorous climbing species to smother young or small trees. Soil moisture content was also found to decrease as tree density increased, suggesting that in the seasonally dry tropics light may not always be the limiting factor for growth.
 Sixteen species were identified which are potentially useful, shade tolerant or shade adapted, pasture species for use beneath tree plantations in both the wet and the seasonally dry tropics. The most promising species suited to the wet tropics were Arachis pintoi, Centrosema acutifolium, C. macrocarpum, C. pubescens, Calopogonium mucunoides, Desmodium intortum, D. ovalifolium, D. canum, D. heterophyllum, D. uncinatum and Pueraria phaseoloides. The most promising species suited to the seasonally dry tropics were Arachis stenosperma, Centrosema brasilianum, Clitoria ternatea, Macroptilium atropurpureum and M. lathyroides.
 Many of the species identified as being shade tolerant, or relatively productive under shade have a climbing habit which can cause concern due to the potential smothering of young or small trees. When climbing species are removed the remaining species suited to the wet tropics are A. pintoi, D. canum, D. heterophyllum, D. intortum and D. ovalifolium, and those to the seasonally dry tropics are A. stenosperma and M. lathyroides. However climbing species may still be of use beneath older plantations or where a higher level of pasture management is acceptable to prevent the smothering of trees through a greater control of the intensity and frequency of grazing or cutting.
 Additional research is required to examine the long-term persistence and performance of the species identified in this study as plantations age and shade levels increase. The compatibility of suitable legume species with shade tolerant grasses is an important aspect, which will affect the production and persistence of the legume species, that has seen relatively little research in the past.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/32/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/32/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of ideological decision making on the materiality of women's lives : a comparative study of child care subsidy policies and services in Australia and California</field><field name="creator">Harris, Nonie</field><field name="description">The intention of this thesis is to use a critical feminist theoretical framework to explore the
 relationship between government ideology, child care subsidy policies and services and the
 materialities of women&#8217;s lives. This exploration is undertaken by:
 &#8226; Comparing child care subsidy policies and services in California and Australia.
 &#8226; Focusing on the experiences and accounts of women service users in California and
 Australia.
 These aims are consistent with feminist literature that encourages researchers to look for
 emerging representations of child care, and also to position child care issues in a range of
 gender equity and social justice discourses.
 Critical feminist theory informs all aspects of the study. It provides the context for framing the
 topic, choosing the methodology, and the analytical lens used for the interpretation of the
 literature and the data. The methodology is micro-level, cross-national comparative and
 qualitative. This study relies on in-depth interviewing as the primary data gathering method.
 Qualitative, cross-national comparative research that values feminist theorising provides a
 unique opportunity to explore child care policy. This study demonstrated that the ideologies that
 benefit patriarchy are embedded in subsidised child care policies and are active cross-nationally.
 In this study the impact of these ideologies differed only in degree, not in the patriarchal intent
 of the policies.
 The women&#8217;s material lives were shaped in different ways by their respective subsidy contexts.
 For the Californian women, accessing a scarce residual service required them to be highly
 resourceful. They were not able to choose the child care they preferred, change their child care
 arrangements if dissatisfied with the quality, or pursue employment advancement because the
 additional income would preclude subsidy access. The Australian women saw their semiuniversal
 subsidy service as an entitlement. The higher levels of subsidy meant they were more
 able than the Californian women to choose the care arrangement they preferred. In reality,
 though, infant and community based child care were difficult to access, the cost of care was a
 significant issue for middle-income women, and the women spent a substantial amount of time
 and effort locating quality care they could afford.
 The women&#8217;s lives were also shaped by their experiences of poverty, racism, individualism and
 sexism. Their vulnerability to these forms of oppression was increased by the use of subsidy
 services. The Californian women recognised their disadvantage due to class and race and actively resisted the construction of themselves implicit in these forms of oppression. The
 Australian women did not identify class and race as forms of oppression related to their use of
 subsidy. However, the semi-universal nature of child care subsidy provided the Australian
 women with the illusion of choice and obscured aspects of the system that reinforced
 conservative roles for women. Whilst the residual Californian subsidy service foregrounded
 oppression based on race and class, it obscured the respondents&#8217; ability to conceptualise their
 experiences as gendered. For both groups of women their gendered disadvantage was rendered
 invisible by neo-liberal individualism and therefore difficult to identify and actively resist.
 Nevertheless and despite these barriers, both groups of women recognised that child care
 subsidy services were not provided to meet the needs of women. They believed policy makers
 were selfishly motivated and concerned with maintaining their own positions of power and
 privilege.
 This study reinforces the value of critical feminist theorising that identifies the ideologies
 embedded in social policies. Placing women&#8217;s experience at the centre of this policy analysis
 revealed the effects of ideological decision making on the materiality of women&#8217;s lives. This
 thesis provides a strong endorsement for the engagement of feminist policy makers and
 members of the women&#8217;s movement with child care policy. Without this feminist engagement
 the mechanisms of patriarchal power, implicit in social policy, will remain obscured and
 unchallenged.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/33/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/33/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The social and discursive construction of itinerant farm workers' children as literacy learners.</field><field name="creator">Henderson, Robyn Wendy</field><field name="description">Using a case study approach, this study examined the social and discursive
 construction of itinerant farm workers&#8217; children as literacy learners within a North
 Queensland primary school. By focusing on six case study families who enrolled at
 the school during two winter harvesting seasons, the study analysed the narratives
 of teachers and of families in order to yield insights into the fields of educational
 itinerancy and literacy.
 Defining literacy as a social practice, the study was framed within cultural-critical
 understandings of literacy, and critical discourse and poststructuralist theories. By
 using these to theorise the social world and literacy learning within it, the research
 examined the social and discursive constructions of the itinerant farm workers&#8217;
 children within the sociocultural contexts of the school and its local community.
 Drawing on Fairclough&#8217;s (1989, 2001c) text- interaction-context model, the study
 used critical discourse analysis to conduct textual and social analyses of interview
 transcripts and selected documents.
 The study found that teachers&#8217; narratives about itinerant farm workers&#8217; children
 were predominantly negative, constructing itinerant children, their families and
 their lifestyles in deficit and stereotypical terms. The taken- for-granted assumption
 that an itinerant lifestyle impacted negatively on children&#8217;s literacy learning meant
 that teachers had low academic expectations of the children. In addition, the
 children&#8217;s families were frequently viewed as culpable for the difficulties that their
 children experienced. Many of the teachers&#8217; narratives reflected community stories
 about farm workers and wider societal stories about families of low socio-economic
 status. Although there were some positive stories in circulation within both the
 school and community contexts, these were very much in the minority.
 The families&#8217; narratives provided "another take" on the events and practices that
 were so often read as negative by those more permanently located in the school and
 community. In providing insights into what it meant to be itinerant, the families
 highlighted their attempts to balance education with lifestyle and to fit into the town where they were residing temporarily. These stories demonstrated that the families&#8217;
 practices were often very different from the commonsense assumptions of teachers
 and community members.
 The study concludes that a reconceptualisation of the literacy learning needs of
 itinerant farm workers&#8217; children should look beyond the school and take account of
 the social and cultural contexts of the children and their families. Such an approach
 should help to shift the focus away from deficits and stories of blame, towards an
 exploration of the literacy strengths that itinerant children bring to school. By
 disrupting deficit views, teachers should be better placed to focus on responsive and
 flexible pedagogies for enabling children to achieve demonstrable and sustainable
 learning outcomes in school literacy learning.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/34/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/34/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology and utilisation of Lumholtz's tree kangaroos Dendrolagus lumholtzi (Marsupialia: Macropodidae), on the Atherton Tablelands, far north Queensland.</field><field name="creator">Coombes, Karen Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Lumholtz&#8217;s tree-kangaroo (Dendrolagus Iumholtzi), one of Australia&#8217;s largest folivores and one of only two tree-kangaroo species endemic to Australia and far north Queensland&#8217;s Wet Tropics. D. Iumholtzi are most commonly found in the fragmented rainforests that remain within an agricultural matrix in a relatively small area on the Atherton Tablelands. Unfortunately the majority of these fragments are on privately owned land and are not totally protected from clearing, therefore their long-term persistence is threatened by land clearing, further habitat fragmentation and mortality from dogs and cars.
 Although there have been a few studies on the ecology and habitat use of D. Iumholtzi, our current knowledge is limited. A more comprehensive understanding of spatial and floristic habitat use is essential for the conservation and management of D. Iumholtzi.
 This study examined the spatial organisation and habitat utilisation of Lumholtz&#8217;s tree-kangaroos in a Type lb rainforest fragment on the Atherton Tablelands and compared this to earlier studies (Procter-Gray 1985, Newell 1999). The two previous studies were both undertaken on the same spatially restricted rainforest type (Type Sb) only a couple of hundred metres apart, so this study has provided an important expansion of our understanding of D. Iumholtzi ecology across space and rainforest types.
 There were no significant effects of rainforest type on the home range sizes of D. Iumholtzi (Procter-Gray 1985, Newell 1999, This study). Male D. Iumholtziin this study held home ranges of 2.1 &#177; 0.7 ha (90% HM) overlapping that of several females but not other males, and females had exclusive home ranges of 2.1 &#177; 0.8 ha (90% HM) of a similar size to males. However, there was a large amount of variation in female home range sizes (0.1 &#8212;4.9 ha). Body weight did not explain this variation in home range sizes.
 This study also examined structural and floristic characteristics of the habitat and investigated if these could be used to model D. Iumholtzi habitat usage. The structural and floristic characters measured in this study could not be used to determine the focus of habitat usage. This study has shown that there is a more complex association between D. Iumholtzi and its use of habitat other than the structural characters of the habitat. D. Iumholtzi do select specific tree species, but there are strongly expressed individual preferences, similar to other arboreal folivores. The reasons for these specific choices are currently unclear but D. Iumholtzi are likely to choose trees for foliage characters, such as the levels of nutrients or plant defences, rather than for the species at a taxonomic level. This is also consistent with other arboreal folivores such as koalas and leaf-eating monkeys. The determination of which foliar characters are driving tree species or individual tree choice will require further research.
 This study tested and rejected a number of previous hypotheses regarding the characteristics determining D. Iumholtzi habitat use. They are not edge specialists, do not prefer regrowth or areas with a large variation in canopy height, or areas with high species diversity or density.
 The gastrointestinal morphology of D. Iumholtzi shares a number of features with other foregut fermenting folivores. Compared to other macropodids, D. Iumholtzi has a large sacciform forestomach and a large overall stomach capacity, and more similar in size and morphology to that of other arboreal foregut fermenting folivores, such as colobine monkeys. It is likely that these characteristics are adaptive for its diet of rainforest leaves.
 Lumholtz&#8217;s tree-kangaroos can be simply aged using a tooth wear index developed during this study. Aging is essential for establishing demographics, such as age specific mortality and fecundity of populations, currently unknown in D. Iumholtzi. Without the ability to age populations we cannot reliably undertake valuable estimations such as population viability analysis, which require these parameters.
 Additionally, this study has highlighted that not only one rainforest type is important to D. Iumholtzi and that more emphasis should be made on the preservation and restoration of all rainforest types. Furthermore, it is vital that all rainforest fragments including riparian zones, regrowth and corridors and stepping stones, should be conserved, rehabilitated and areas replanted as D. Iumholtzi habitat, as they are crucial to the species long term survival.

 the three-dimensional geometry of these features is shown as an animation, a stereo pair, a

 approximately 10 &#956;m, is high enough to resolve inclusions, and finer resolutions are possible.
 Comparisons of scan imagery to thin section and microprobe data demonstrate that many typical

 Pomacanthidae: the implications of functional
 innovations on prey-dislodgement in biting reef fishes</field><field name="creator">Konow, Nicolai</field><field name="description">On coral reefs, biting teleosts form a major component of reef fish assemblages.
 Nevertheless, they have been largely overlooked in functional research, while their ramsuction
 feeding counterparts have received considerable attention over the past few
 decades. This thesis therefore examines the functional basis of biting in coral reef fishes,
 with a focus on the marine angelfishes (f. Pomacanthidae), and other deep-bodied
 squamipinnid fishes.
 To evaluate the magnitude and role of functional specialisation associated with
 prey-capture in angelfishes, a basal species, Pomacanthus semicirculatus (Cuvier, 1931)
 was selected as a model taxon for comprehensive functional analysis. The feeding
 apparatus of Pomacanthus contains two biomechanical mechanisms of particular interest:
 an intramandibular joint, and a suspensorial linkage with two novel points of flexion. Preycapture
 kinematics were quantified using motion analysis of high-speed video, generating
 performance profiles to illustrate timing of onset, duration and magnitude of movement in
 the novel mechanisms. Mandible depression and suspensorial rotation coincide during jaw
 protrusion, and augment mandible protrusion to increase head length typically by 30%.
 Jaw closure at peak jaw protrusion appears to result from contraction of the adductor
 mandibulae segment A2, the only segment with insertions facilitating rotation of the
 dentary by approx. 30&#186; relative to the articular. Feeding events are concluded by a highvelocity
 jaw retraction typically lasting 20-50 ms, and completed in 450-750 msec.
 Pomacanthus feeding morphology and kinematics differ from other biting teleosts, and more closely resemble some long-jawed ram-suction feeders, with the novel feeding
 kinematics matching an unusual diet of structurally resilient and firmly attached prey.
 Ten angelfish species representing all phylogenetic lineages were chosen from the
 GBR fauna, in order to analyse morphological and kinematic disparity in the angelfish
 feeding apparatus. Angelfish cranial architecture exhibits remarkable evolutionary stability
 with constructional changes restricted to key suspensorial specialisations governing
 increased jaw protrusibility, differential jaw protrusion angles and variations in alimentary
 tract morphology. Whilst it was previously suggested that intramandibular joints increase
 mechanical complexity and expand jaw-gape, in angelfishes the joint is a synapomorphy
 with novel gape-restricting kinematics. Individual means of the 32 most informative
 kinematics variables in Pomacanthus were extracted from high-speed video of feeding
 events. Concordant with phylogenetic evidence, the derived pygmy-angel subgenera,
 Centropyge [Centropyge] and C. [Xiphypops] differ significantly in several traits, whereas
 the basal Pomacanthus subgenera are largely indistinguishable. The monotypic Pygoplites
 exhibits the most pronounced flexion and Genicanthus consistently demonstrate the most
 restricted flexion in most variables measured.
 Mapping of informative alimentary traits to a phylogeny delineated divergent
 angelfish feeding guilds. Grab-and-tearing omnivory on sponges and other sturdy prey is
 utilised by several large and robust taxa and constitutes the basal trophic guild. More
 gracile, biting omnivory is commonly utilised in derived pygmy-angel taxa, while
 dislodging herbivory arose both in the basal large-bodied P. [Euxiphipops] and in the
 derived C. [Xiphypops]; planktivory in Genicanthus is atavistic. Gape-restricting
 intramandibular flexion, suspensorial rotation augmenting lower jaw protrusion and a high-velocity jaw retraction are important functional innovations with major implications for
 angelfish feeding morphology and kinematics. Coupled with distinct size differences
 amongst taxa, these traits form the functional basis for a considerable ecological
 diversification in angelfishes.
 The functional basis of biting in reef fishes was investigated in 11 deep-bodied
 families, to examine the relationships between novel intramandibular joints and associated
 trophic ecology. The results suggest convergent intramandibular joint evolution leading to
 biting strategies in at least five families. Restricted flexion repeatedly coincides with
 functional reversion to zoo-planktivory while basal ram-suction feeders generally lack
 flexion. In angelfishes, intramandibular joints are symplesiomorphic and evolutionarily
 stable, exhibiting limited kinematic divergence, averaging flexion of 27&#177;11.1&#186; and causing
 jaw occlusion at peak protrusion. Angelfish kinematics contrast with all other
 intramandibular joint bearers, in which gape-expanding flexion concludes prior to jawclosure.
 Intramandibular flexion and transition from ram-suction to biting in butterflyfishes
 coincide, with flexion magnitude, culminating in the crown-group of Corallochaetodon
 (16&#177;6.6&#186;) and Citharoedus (49&#177;2.7&#186;).
 Character mapping and optimisation revealed that up to seven intramandibular
 flexion transitions/reversals consistently correspond with trophic transitions from freeliving
 to attached prey. Whilst functional patterns reflect convergence of this joint, the
 evolutionary origin of intramandibular flexion in the squamipinnid fishes remains
 ambiguous. Nevertheless, a complex evolutionary history appears to have led to
 widespread intramandibular joint occurrence in extant biting groups, suggesting that this is
 a major functional innovation, and a functional prerequisite to biting in many reef fish taxa. In summary, the functional innovations of the angelfish feeding apparatus allow
 these fishes to pass ecological thresholds and exploit novel trophic strategies, using graband-
 tearing for herbivory and spongivory. Intramandibular joints appear to have been an
 important functional innovation, playing a similar role in driving the ecological
 diversification of the squamipinnes as the pharyngeal jaw apparatus in the Labroidei.
 However, an emerging trend of reduced feeding apparatus disparity in biters, when
 compared to ram-suction feeding taxa, supports the theory that novel traits can pose
 constraints on functional diversification. The results herein illustrate the utility of direct
 performance testing in quantifying disparity patterns at the organismal and assemblagelevel
 and emphasise the potential for combining ecomorphological and biomechanical
 techniques in elucidating the functional basis of the biting feeding mode.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/56/3/Apol.mpg</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/56/4/CCen.mpg</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/56/5/Chae.mpg</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/56/6/Cxip.mpg</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/56/7/Geni.mpg</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/56/8/Paru.mpg</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/56/9/Peux.mpg</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/56/10/Pygo.mpg</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/56/11/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/56/12/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Operator compliance and attitudinal compliance to aspects of
 Australian whale watch management conditions</field><field name="creator">Lalime, Joline Michelle</field><field name="description">Whale watching is a rapidly growing industry worldwide, involving vulnerable species,
 with few data on impacts and no data on success of enforcement of regulations.
 Because of this, the extent to which whale watching may impact on focal species is
 increasingly becoming an international concern. In early 1998, an international whalewatching
 research workshop in Monaco identified "problems of enforcement of
 regulations" as one of the four major problems with the management of whale
 watching. In 2000, Australia implemented the ANZECC Guidelines for Cetacean
 Observation in Commonwealth waters, while individual states are responsible for
 developing their own guidelines or regulations.
 Effective management of the whale-watch industry is dependent on operators'
 compliance to the appropriate management regimes. Operators' compliance with
 existing regulations and guidelines has not been studied in detail. The study aimed to
 test whether existing distance and approach conditions for whale watch vessels are an
 effective regulatory tool by: 1) observing whale watch operations that target humpback
 whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in Queensland and New South Wales' waters and 2)
 conducting a questionnaire survey of whale watch operators&#8217; attitudes towards
 compliance. Movements of whale watch vessels in relation to focal humpback whale
 pods were tracked using a handheld GPS, a Laser Range Finder and a Digital
 Compass at the two field sites. This provided an indication of operators' compliance
 with distance and approach guidelines and regulations. Questionnaire surveys were
 used to elicit the potential influence of operators' beliefs and perceptions concerning
 the whale watch guidelines on compliance.
 Management differences between the states of Australia even for the same species of
 cetacean, is a management issue that needs resolution. I found that there are now a
 total of 35 legislative documents across Australia that provide general or specific
 protection to whales during general public or commercial vessel observation. Although
 the legislation is fairly consistent, the inconsistencies across jurisdictions regarding
 distances of approach and explanations of terms can lead to confusion and the
 perception that legislation has no basis, increasing the chance of non-compliance. I used qualitative research methodology to understand the factors that influence the
 attitudinal compliance of whale watch operators. The whale watch operators&#8217;
 perceptions regarding the level of certainty or level of threat of legal sanctions, the level
 of monitoring, and endorsement of operators of non-compliance all had a positive
 relationship with attitudinal compliance of whale watch operators. Attitudinal
 compliance had a negative relationship with sole owner-operator status, the voluntary
 nature of guidelines, and the belief in the fairness of guidelines.
 Compliance by operators to whale watch guidelines or regulations is influenced by the
 behaviour of the whale(s) being observed. There is a proportion of the migrating whale
 population that actively approaches vessels and although operators may encourage
 this behaviour, it is uncontrollable. Therefore, although there are instances of noncompliance
 by whale watch operators, it is the active approach by a whale pod that
 leads to the perception of higher rates of non-compliance by whale watch operators.
 There was no correlation between operators&#8217; level of vessel experience or
 environmental factors with actual compliance. Furthermore, operators&#8217; attitudinal
 compliance and actual compliance were not correlated.
 Recommendations from this study include: 1) improving consistency in legislation to
 reduce confusion; 2) progressing guidelines to regulations to increase enforceability; 3)
 increasing person to person consultation between regulators and whale watch
 operators to increase the understanding of legislation and the perception of fairness
 and 4) investigating the proportion of migrating whales that are more likely to approach
 vessels to determine the actual percentage of the population on which the whale watch
 industry is based as a basis for evaluating the risk of possible detrimental impacts from
 whale watching.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/57/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/57/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Species boundaries in scleractinian corals: a case study of the Acropora humilis species group</field><field name="creator">Wolstenholme, Jackie</field><field name="description">Accurate identification of species is critical for studies of biological systems, including biodiversity analyses, understanding evolutionary processes and ecological dynamics, and for effective conservation and management of the environment. However, defining species boundaries in scleractinian corals is impeded by the difficulties of distinguishing between ecological and evolutionary influences on the appearance of colony morphology. In this study, I used three criteria, i.e. reproductive, morphometric and molecular evidence to determine the extent to which intraspecific and interspecific morphological variation is indicative of evolutionary relationships in species of the Acropora humilis species group. Reproductive criteria, including relative timing of spawning and potential to interbreed in fertilization experiments, provided the greatest level of taxonomic resolution. Discriminant analysis of morphometric data provided a moderate level of resolution. Molecular phylogenetic analysis of two markers, the 28S rDNA unit (domains 1 and 2) and the mtDNA intergenic region, provided the lowest level of resolution of the three criteria.
 Twenty-one morphs were recognized in field surveys, conducted in seven regions in the western and central Pacific, and these were used as sampling units throughout this study. The morphs were defined using morphological characters that are traditionally used to identify species of the genus Acropora and included the eight currently recognized species of the A. humilis group, seven intermediate morphs and six sub-morphs. The intermediate morphs were characterized by intermediate morphologies that prevented colonies from being confidently assigned to a single species, and the sub-morphs formed recognizable units within the range of morphological variation of one species. Differentiation between species and morphs greatly enhanced the interpretation of evolutionary relationships in this species group, with consistent patterns being found throughout the geographic scale of this project. Colonies identified as A. humilis, A. samoensis, A. gemmifera, A. monticulosa and A. digitifera were shown to be valid species on the basis of reproductive data. Although these species showed no potential to interbreed, it is possible that indirect introgression, through interbreeding between some members of these species and morphs may be retarding divergence of these species. Reproductive data were not obtained for A. globiceps, A. retusa and A. multiacuta. The taxonomic status of A. globiceps is therefore unresolved, due to its lack of morphological and genetic differentiation from A. humilis. Acropora retusa and A. multiacuta appear to be valid species, on the basis of morphological and molecular differentiation. Acropora humilis, A. samoensis, A. globiceps and morphs of these species share the greatest evolutionary affinity, on the basis of morphological overlap and lack of genetic differentiation. The most closely related to these three species appears to be A. gemmifera, with this species and morphs common to these four species also being genetically undifferentiated. Acropora digitifera was morphologically and genetically distinct from all other species of the A. humilis group, although an intermediate morph between this species and A. gemmifera was genetically undifferentiated but reproductively isolated from A. digitifera. On the basis of morphological affinity, this morph is proposed as a possible hybrid between these species. Acropora monticulosa was morphologically distinct from all other species, although it appears to share evolutionary connections on two fronts. Firstly, low levels of genetic differentiation for the mitochondrial marker, between this species and A. humilis, A. samoensis, A. globiceps and A. gemmifera, suggest recent divergence from these species. Secondly, A. monticulosa also appears to share evolutionary affinities with A. digitifera on the basis of morphological similarities between morphs of each of these species, with one of these morphs grouping with A. monticulosa for the 28S marker and with A. digitifera for the mitochondrial marker.
 This study demonstrates that examining intraspecific and interspecific patterns of polymorphism are valuable for interpreting evolutionary relationships in corals. Evidence derived from these criteria suggest that the morphs are at various stages of divergence from the species with which they share morphological characters and that the morphs may indicate possible zones of speciation and hybridization. Recognition of morphs also avoided the possibility of taxonomic error as a result of &#8216;forcing&#8217; colonies into incorrect or inappropriate species categories and was therefore essential for accurate interpretation of evolutionary boundaries. Using multiple criteria and samples collected across a broad biogeographic scale facilitated the clarification of relationships within and between species.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/58/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/58/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Psychological wellbeing as a consequence of situational elements in the new labour market</field><field name="creator">McIntyre, Duncan</field><field name="description">Approximately four thousand call centres employ more than 160,000 people in Australia, yet relatively little attention has been paid to how this type of work influences the wellbeing of those who do it &#8211; despite substantially higher absence frequencies and turnover rates relative to other industries.

 buffaloes have not been extensively investigated. Designing of future approaches for
 the control of tropical fasciolosis requires an understanding of the host-parasite
 relationships. This study was therefore undertaken to look at and compare the hostparasite
 interactions of F. gigantica infection between cattle (Bos indicus) and swamp
 buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis). This study compared the prevalence of infection, clinicopathological
 and parasitological manifestations, sequential production of antibody
 isotypes and of Th1 and Th2 cytokines, local immune responses, and the
 histopathology of the infection between cattle and swamp buffaloes during infection
 with F. gigantica.
 The study shows that cattle and buffaloes are both susceptible to infection with F.
 gigantica in the Philippines with the infection affecting young and old animals.
 However, there are indications that these animals differ in their responses to infection.
 The red blood cell (RBC) count was significantly higher in infected than in noninfected
 swamp buffaloes (P&lt;0.05) while there was no significant difference in
 packed cell volume (PCV) and haemoglobin values between infected and non-infected
 buffaloes (P&gt;0.05). Red blood cell count was significantly higher in buffaloes with
 high fluke burdens (&gt;70 flukes) than those with no flukes or with medium fluke
 burden (21-70 flukes) (P&lt;0.05). Significantly higher PCV value was also observed in
 buffaloes with high fluke burdens compared with those with low or medium worm
 loads (P&lt;0.05). Haemoglobin values did not differ significantly between buffaloes
 with low, medium, high or no fluke burdens (P&gt;0.05). On the other hand, infected
 cattle showed significantly lower RBC counts than non-infected cattle (P&lt;0.05) and
 these counts were negatively related to fluke burden. Packed cell volume was also
 significantly lower in cattle with high fluke burden than those with fewer flukes
 (P&lt;0.05). These findings showed that swamp buffaloes were not as severely affected
 by F. gigantica compared with cattle suggesting that they can cope with infection
 much better than cattle. From these observations, it was concluded that swamp
 buffaloes are more resilient to F. gigantica infection than cattle. There was a trend of a lower fluke burden and faecal egg counts in naturally infected
 swamp buffaloes than in cattle. Fluke burdens were also lower in buffaloes than cattle
 at 3, 7, 12 and 16 weeks post- experimental infection with 1000 metacercariae.
 Sixteen weeks after the experimental infection, eggs were already seen in cattle but
 none in buffaloes and only immature flukes were present in buffaloes at this time,
 indicating that the prepatent period of F. gigantica in cattle is shorter than in swamp
 buffaloes. These findings support a conclusion that swamp buffaloes are more
 resistant than cattle to F. gigantica.
 An indirect ELISA was done to assess the sequential production of antibody isotypes
 IgG1, IgG2 and IgE reacting to F. gigantica. Infected cattle and buffaloes showed
 increased levels of these isotypes relative to the controls. No marked increase in IgG1
 and IgG2 occurred in cattle except during the later part of infection. In buffaloes, the
 elevations of these two isotypes showed a pattern of increasing trend. IgG1 and IgG2
 values in buffaloes were higher than in cattle. It is proposed that IgG2 may be
 associated with resistance against F. gigantica in these species, higher IgG2 in
 buffaloes being related to the higher resistance observed in these animals compared
 with that in cattle.
 The levels of IFN-&#947;, IL-6 and IL-8 in serum of cattle and buffaloes were assessed by a
 sandwich ELISA. IFN-&#947; was not present in detectable levels in the serum of these
 animals suggesting that this cytokine may not be important in the immune response
 against F. gigantica in cattle and swamp buffaloes. Serum IL-6 levels were higher in
 infected than in non-infected animals from one to 16 weeks post-infection and higher
 in cattle than in buffaloes. This suggests that IL-6 is not important in resistance
 against F. gigantica in these animals. Higher serum IL-8 levels were observed in
 infected buffaloes than in cattle suggesting that this cytokine is associated with the
 higher degree of resistance against F. gigantica in swamp buffaloes than in cattle.
 The local immune response in the liver of infected animals was assessed by
 immunohistochemistry and histology. T and B lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils
 and mast cells were present in hepatic lesions. A progressive increase in T cell
 numbers occurred after infection in buffaloes whereas these continuously declined in cattle after a sharp rise at three weeks post-infection. The numbers of B lymphocytes
 and plasma cells increased from 3-16 weeks post-infection in both species.
 Eosinophils were also present in hepatic lesions, which may be partly a consequence
 of the degranulation of mast cells in hepatic lesions as a result of antigenic stimulation
 from the flukes. It is concluded that both cellular and humoral responses are induced
 in the liver of cattle and swamp buffaloes infected with F. gigantica. The T cell
 response in cattle was apparently suppressed after week 3 of infection which may be
 due partly to the rapid migration of flukes or to a suppression of the local immune
 response in the liver of cattle by F. gigantica. The increasing responsiveness in
 buffaloes represented by the gradually increasing numbers of T lymphocytes may
 have contributed to the suppression of development of flukes or delayed their
 migration in these animals. This difference in the expression of the hepatic T cell
 response between cattle and swamp buffaloes may be related to the observed
 differences in their level of resistance against F. gigantica.
 The percentage of eosinophils in the blood increased in infected animals. The
 eosinophilia observed may have resulted from the generalized inflammation following
 liver fluke infection and may not be protective as migrating flukes or dead flukes with
 surrounding eosinophils were not seen in the liver. Eosinophilia also indicates a
 stimulation of a Th2-type of immune response in these animals during infection with
 F. gigantica. The kinetics of eosinophilia differed between hosts. A rapid
 eosinophilia was observed within 1-3 weeks post-infection in cattle whereas this was
 considerably delayed in buffaloes to weeks 6-11. The slower eosinophil response in
 buffaloes may be associated with the increased resistance to F. gigantica in this host,
 i.e eosinophils are not an effector cell involved in killing immature F. gigantica
 during the first five weeks of infection.
 Histopathology of liver and hepatic lymph nodes revealed some differences in the
 extent of lesions between cattle and swamp buffaloes at different periods of infection.
 At three weeks post-infection, focal necrosis was present in cattle but not in buffaloes.
 The hepatic lymph node (HLN) of cattle showed stronger follicular and parafollicular
 hyperplasia compared with buffaloes. Lymphocytic infiltration in portal areas was
 more marked in cattle than buffaloes at seven weeks post-infection and more plasma cells were present in the medullary cords of HLN of cattle than buffaloes. Marked
 portal reaction, bile duct hyperplasia and severe cirrhosis were seen in cattle at 12
 weeks post-infection. Only moderate cirrhosis was observed in buffaloes at the same
 time post-infection. At 16 weeks post-infection in cattle necrosis of bile ducts was
 seen with mostly eosinophils in the inflammatory infiltrate. In buffaloes, most of the
 inflammatory cells were lymphocytes. These results imply that there was milder
 damage and inflammatory response in the liver and milder stimulation of the HLN at
 some stages of infection in buffaloes compared with cattle which could be due to their
 lower fluke burden or to the delayed migration or suppressed development of flukes in
 buffaloes.
 Results of this study showed that there were similarities and differences in the immune
 responses of cattle and buffaloes during infection with F. gigantica. These varying
 responses to F. gigantica infection represent differences in host-parasite relationships
 of F. gigantica infection between cattle and swamp buffaloes and may be linked to the
 observed varying levels of resistance and resilience to infection between these hosts.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/61/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/61/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mothering and attention deficit disorder: the impact of professional power</field><field name="creator">Rogers, Dianne</field><field name="description">In this country and overseas the debate on what causes Attention Deficit Disorder
 (ADD) and the interventions necessary is conducted fiercely along with claims and
 counterclaims as to the validity of the disorder. It appears that everyone has an
 opinion on the real-ness or otherwise of ADD. What is missing from this debate,
 which takes place in the media, in academic circles and in the general community, is
 the day to day reality of living with ADD, as a woman or as a mother. This thesis
 explores the relationship between power and knowledge in the competing discourses
 on Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). It also examines the ideology of motherhood
 and the construct of difference.
 The research for this thesis took place in North Queensland and tells the stories of
 women affected by ADD, primarily the mothers of children with ADD. In telling
 their stories, the women identify their children as different, in that they learn and
 experience the world differently. They articulate that their child&#8217;s difference attracts
 stigma and blame, not so much to the child, but to the mother of the child, as she is
 seen by many in the general community and by professionals as causing her child&#8217;s
 difference. The women also report that their families are different and that they live
 different lives from commonly accepted norms.
 This thesis demonstrates that these women struggle, usually unsupported, to parent
 their children and that some women are also supporting husbands who may have
 ADD, thus revealing that they endure enormous physical and emotional workloads.
 These workloads and the isolation and marginalisation that occur within their
 families and in the general community affect their physical and mental health. This
 thesis also reveals that some mothers are subjected to verbal and physical abuse from
 their children. This research demonstrates that abuse is not confined to the home as
 women experience abuse from by both professionals and governments which seek to
 normalise the mothers and their children.
 Not content to be labelled as bad mothers, the women challenge professional
 discourses which hold them responsible for having different children and different families. These women create their own discourse on ADD which is based on their
 experience of having ADD or parenting children with ADD. Their knowledge is
 used to advocate for families and individuals and to provide, where possible,
 practical strategies or support.
 This thesis recommends that a strengths based focus needs to be implemented,
 especially within the education system and professional practices to prevent abuse. It
 also calls for professionals to work alongside families to implement programs and
 strategies that support family members. Additional research is called for to explore
 what it means to be different and how difference impacts on all members of the
 family. Another area of crucial further research would be to determine how fathers
 can contribute more fully to raising their children and supporting their partners. In
 conclusion this thesis argues that difference is a currency that runs through our
 society and that society has choices to make regarding difference. It can choose to
 pathologise difference, or it can embrace difference as a vital part of humanity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/63/2/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/63/3/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geographic variation in size at age of the coral reef fish, Thalassoma lunare (family: Labridae) : a contribution to life history theory.</field><field name="creator">Ackerman, J. L.</field><field name="description">Key life history traits such as age at maturity, longevity and mortality have all shown correlations with body size. However, the relationship between age and size is particularly important as growth rates (size per time) can have a profound influence on reproductive capabilities and survival. This is especially so in the context of trade-offs between traits, where fast growth may reduce survivability. One way to test trade-offs between life history traits such as growth, reproduction and survival is to examine phenotypic correlations between distinct populations. Life history attributes of populations have been shown to vary over large geographical ranges, in particular those involving a latitudinal or altitudinal gradient. Temperature is likely to be a particularly important factor influencing life histories at these scales, especially for those animals that rely on external sources for body heat. Numerous studies of terrestrial ectotherms have shown that at higher latitudes (or altitudes) body size is often larger than that of lower latitudes. Furthermore, life history theory predicts that at higher latitudes (lower temperatures) individuals should exhibit larger final body sizes but smaller size at age (i.e. slower growth). With slower growth there is likely to be a trend towards later maturation, but greater longevity. With later maturation (at larger sizes) reproductive effort is delayed, however there is the potential for greater fecundity (assuming fecundity increases with body size). However, these theoretical predictions were yet to be tested in coral reef fish. Therefore, the objective of this project was to examine age-based parameters in discrete populations of Thalassoma lunare, a widespread and opportunistic wrasse, to evaluate whether reef fish fit predictions of traditional life history theory. Addressing this question is fundamental to our understanding of reef fish populations, the dynamics of interactions and the diversity of coral reef fish. Thalassoma lunare is widely distributed, found along much of the East Australian coastline, surrounding Pacific Islands and Indian Ocean. Thalassoma lunare is found throughout both inshore, midshelf and outer shelf reefs on the Great Barrier Reef, temperate rocky reef systems and exposed, sheltered and lagoonal sites. Therefore, it was an ideal study organism to look at regional scales for the determination of life history trade-offs in coral reef fishes. The broad aims of this project, therefore, were to 1) describe the age-based biology of T. lunare, and 2) determine whether life history trade-offs exist between growth, reproduction and longevity in this species by comparing populations along a latitudinal gradient within two oceanic basins. Specifically, the variables to be studied were size at age, lifetime growth trajectories, initial growth rates, age and size at maturity, age and size specific sex distributions, mortality and life span. To describe the age-based biology of T. lunare, samples were collected at temporal intervals for a period of two years from the Palm Group of islands, including Pelorus and Orpheus Islands. Age estimates were determined from otolith samples and reproductive parameters were gathered from both macroscopic and histological techniques. To determine whether life history trade-offs exist, geographically separate populations along two latitudinal gradients were examined, one each in the Indian and Pacific Basins, ranging from 4oS to 32oS. Otolith samples for age estimation and gonads for reproductive variables were collected in the East Indian Ocean from Scott Reef (14oS), Tantabiddi, Ningaloo Reef North (22oS), Coral Bay, Ningaloo Reef South (23oS), Beacon Island, the Houtman Abrolhos Islands (29oS) and Rottnest Island (32oS). In the West Pacific Basin samples were collected from Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea (PNG; 5oS), Roviana Lagoon, Solomon Islands (8oS), Lizard Island (14oS), the Palm Group of islands (19oS), One tree Island (23oS) and Cabbage Tree Island, Port Stephens (32oS). In addition, two exposed outer shelf reefs were sampled along this latitudinal gradient to account for habitat variation, one at 14oS (approximately 30km east of Lizard Island) and the other at 23oS (exposed outer shelf reef surrounding the One Tree Island Lagoon). Coral reef fish have been shown to exhibit variation in life history traits due to habitat variation. This can be caused by environmental differences in biotic factors such as predation or competition or abiotic factors such as wave action or habitat structure. Therefore, it was imperative that local scale variation (habitat) in life history parameters was examined in conjunction with the large geographic scale study. A gradient of increasing size, survivability and longevity and decreasing mortality was expected from exposed habitats through sheltered to lagoonal habitats. Therefore, three regional sites were chosen along the latitudinal gradients, two located within the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) and one in the Indian Ocean for the examination of local scale life history differences. These included the Lizard Island Region and the Palm Group of Islands within the GBR and Scott Reef in the Indian Ocean. At Lizard Island, 3 habitat types were identified, exposed reef, sheltered reefs and a lagoon. The Palm Group of islands consisted of 4 sheltered locations and Scott Reef consisted of an outer exposed reef habitat, and two sheltered habitats, an inner reef and the leeward side of a sandy cay. Otolith increments in T. lunare were found to be yearly in formation with no evidence of fish living beyond that of 7 years of age. The plot of size against age showed similar patterns of initial rapid increases followed by a tapering growth trajectory similar to those of other labroid fishes. Whilst mature females were evident in the population at the age and size of 1 year and 70mm Standard Length (SL) respectively, 50% maturity did not occur for females until approximately 2 years of age and 90mm SL. Furthermore, no females were found beyond 5 years of age and 130mm SL, whilst males were only evident in the population after 2 years of age and 90mm SL. This is typical of a protogynous hermaphrodite, where individuals change sex from females to males. Whilst no running ripe gonads were found in the winter months, they were found in April, October and November. In addition, spawning aggregations were observed in July and ripe gonads were found in August. It appears, therefore, that spawning events may occur throughout the year at the Palm Group of islands. Variations in age-based parameters of T. lunare populations across latitudinal gradients throughout the West Pacific Basin and East Indian Ocean were in stark contrast to the predictions. The expected gradient of increasing size and longevity and decreasing mortality was not always observed from lower to higher latitudes. Instead, reef exposure played a significant role in shaping life history parameters of these coral reef fish populations. Gradients from exposed reefs through to sheltered reefs were more likely to cause an increase in size and longevity and a decrease in initial growth rates and mortality. A general pattern of increasing longevity with increasing latitude was evident in the Indian Ocean but not in the Pacific Basin. Mean 20% longevity estimates from regions in the Indian Ocean were highest at Rottnest Is and the Abrolhos Is, in the south, being significantly greater than those estimates from Ningaloo South and Scott Reef. In the Pacific Basin, mean 20% longevity estimates followed a habitat cline more so than a latitudinal one. With the exception of One Tree Island Outer Reef, which exhibited large variation due to small sample sizes, the majority of regions with high estimates of longevity were those with relatively sheltered environments, such as the One Tree Island Lagoon and the inshore Palm Group. Growth at all regions showed similar patterns of initial rapid increases followed by a tapering growth trajectory as those found at the Palm Group of islands. However, both the Indian Ocean and Pacific Basins exhibited little evidence of predicted latitudinal gradients in growth trajectories. There was no evidence of differences in growth parameters between PNG and Port Stephens, two regions separated by the greatest distance. In addition, the Outer Shelf Reef at Lizard Island and the One Tree Island Outer Reef were similar to these two regions, indicative of a habitat difference rather than a large latitudinal gradient. Instantaneous growth rates revealed patterns inconsistent with the theory that higher latitudes (colder waters; 18&#8211;25oC) would exhibit slower initial growth rates compared with lower latitudes (warmer waters; 26&#8211;31oC). In both oceanic basins the slowest rates were found in the mid-latitudinal regions. Additionally, mortality estimates were also highest at the mid-latitudinal regions. In general, female fish were mature by 1 year of age, and few mature females remained in the population beyond 4 years of age, with the majority of regions exhibiting substantial numbers of males in the 2-year-old age class. Maturity ogives for the regions in the Indian Ocean show that 50% female maturity was at the lowest ages for the midlatitudinal regions and highest for the most southern region sampled. One Tree Island Outer Reef and Port Stephens, in the Pacific Basin revealed the lowest age at which 50% female maturity occurred, whilst the highest value occurred at the Palm Group. There was little evidence of a latitudinal pattern regarding sex change in the Indian Ocean; however, a pattern was evident in the Pacific. Populations at the PNG and Solomon Is regions showed the earliest age at sex change, whilst the population at Port Stephens showed a later age of 50% sex change. In general, 50% female maturity occurred at approximately 40% of a population&#8217;s maximum size and 10 to 20% of a population&#8217;s maximum age, whilst 50% sex change occurred at approximately 70% of a population&#8217;s maximum size and 30 to 50% of a population&#8217;s maximum age. For most populations, size and age at maturity was generally related to their final body size and size and age at sex change was generally related to size and age at maturity. However, in areas of relatively high densities, e.g. Ningaloo South, OTI lagoon, Solomon Is and PNG, there appeared to be a significantly shorter period between the age at which 50% female maturity occurred and the age at which 50% sex change occurred. There was significant variation in age-based demographic parameters between habitats, within regions. However, this variation was often not consistent with the predictions that a gradient would exist from the exposed through sheltered to lagoonal habitats of increasing size and age and reduced estimates of mortality, as observed habitat parameters differed between regions. Longevity estimates between habitats, within regions, were only evident at the Palm Group and Scott Reef regions. This is surprising, as these two regions were less heterogeneous in exposure compared with the surrounding habitats of Lizard Island. However, growth trajectories exhibited differences between sheltered and exposed locations of Lizard Island with little difference found between habitats within the other two regions. Mortality, whilst fitting predictions at one region, was generally not consistent between regions. Differences in mortality estimates were only evident between the exposed and sheltered reefs of Lizard Island. Whilst a gradient of slower growth, later maturation, larger final body sizes and increasing longevities have been shown to exist in terrestrial ectotherms, for coral reef fish this may not always be the case. Age-based parameters of T. lunare appear to be more susceptible to habitat variation than large regional scales and/or large temperature differences. Therefore, exposed outer reef habitats are more likely to impose smaller final body sizes, potentially reduced longevities and increased mortality in contrast to the more sheltered inshore environments. Further work is now necessary to determine the biotic and abiotic factors that affect populations of coral reef fish across these habitat scales, especially traits such as age at maturity, longevity and mortality. Additionally, research is needed to link these life history attributes with phylogenetic information. Finally, modelling the extent to which phenotypic flexibility exists amongst traits between genetically similar populations will increase our understanding of evolved strategies to account for habitat heterogeneity.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/66/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/66/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parental and environmental effects on the early life history of a tropical reef fish, Amphiprion melanopus</field><field name="creator">Green, Bridget Siobhan</field><field name="description">Tropical coral reef fish larvae are characterised by high mortality, which is predominantly driven by size- and growth- selective processes. While recent studies of environmental correlates have explained 7 - 36 % of the variation in larval growth rate in wild populations, the majority of the variation in growth rate and recruitment remains unexplained. This thesis used a series of laboratory experiments to assess the contribution of environmental and parental influences on embryonic, larval and juvenile growth and development in a tropical marine fish species, Amphiprion melanopus (Pomacentridae).
 Maternally determined egg size coupled with clutch micro-environment was important in determining initial offspring size. By sampling embryos and larvae for morphometric measurement and metabolic rate, we found that size differences between offspring within a clutch were related to the clutch design. Eggs on the periphery of newly laid clutches were 2% smaller than eggs from the centre, and this size difference increased throughout embryonic development. Larvae hatched from the clutch periphery were 6 &#8211; 8 % smaller than larvae hatched from the clutch centre. Embryos on the clutch periphery had 63 % lower rates of oxygen consumption. Changes in oxygen consumption throughout development were related to developmental changes within the embryo.
 Given that the study species, like many demersal spawning fishes, has parental care of the eggs, we explored whether parental tending modified the oxygen microenvironment of the embryos, and subsequently, whether tending was modified according to ambient dissolved oxygen (DO), increasing metabolic demands of developing embryos and water temperature. There was a time lag of 1 second between fanning and increases in the amount of oxygen within the nest, demonstrating that DO is directly affected by parental tending. Males invested more time tending nests (40 % initially) than did females (20 &#8211; 30 %), and male investment increased to 70 % as embryo development progressed. Additionally, male fish adjusted fanning effort on a diel cycle as ambient DO fluctuated. The female&#8217;s investment in nest tending was minor in comparison to the males and did not change with ontogeny, with the exception of a small increase in activity just prior to hatching. Nest tending appears to be an important mechanism whereby males can invest in the survival of their offspring.
 To determine the relative importance of maternal, paternal and environmental (specifically temperature) influences on early life history traits, we experimentally examined their interactive influences on larval growth, swimming ability and developmental rate using a full factorial (diallel) breeding design. There were strong paternal and maternal influences in size at hatching and metamorphosis, and surprisingly, paternal affects were responsible for 52 % of the variation in growth rate, while 30 % was attributable to the combination of temperature*female*male. We speculate this was due to the significant male contribution through their key role in nest tending. Pre-hatch egg size, post-hatching larvae size and size at metamorphosis all showed significant influences from male and female, and the interaction of these, while temperature had minimal influences on size at particular development stages. Temperature did, however, reduce developmental rate, increasing the time taken to reach metamorphosis by 50%. Larvae reared in water 25 &#186;C (3 &#186;C below ambient) were smaller than larvae reared at ambient temperature (28 &#186;C) at the same age (7 days after hatching, dah), and had slower critical swimming performance but took longer to metamorphose (mean: 8.9 &#177; 0.06 days at 28 &#186;C and 11.6 &#177; 0.09 days at 25&#186;C). When this slower developmental time was factored in to size and swimming, fish reared at 25 &#186;C were larger at similar developmental age (11dah, pre-metamorphosis). This stage-specific size increase did not result in better performance as there was no difference in swimming ability immediately prior to settlement (11dah), despite slower swimming for larvae raised at 25 &#176;C, 7dah.
 This thesis shows that position of an embryo within a clutch, maternally- determined egg size and subsequent parental care were important in influencing the condition and performance of marine fish embryos and larvae. Size advantages began in the embryonic stage due to maternal investment through gametogenesis and the allocation of endogenous reserves to the egg, and were enhanced throughout development. This thesis suggests that parental contributions to the embryo were important to size, growth and performance of larvae, and may be the source of previously unexplained variation in larval growth and survival.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/68/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/68/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular phylogenetics and the evolutionary history of reproductive strategies in benthic shallow-water octopuses
 (Cephalopoda: Octopodinae)</field><field name="creator">Guzik, Michelle Tanya</field><field name="description">The adaptive nature of egg size and juvenile types is of fundamental interest to the life history theory of benthic marine invertebrates. One tenet of life history theory for these organisms predicts that the evolution and maintenance of dichotomous reproductive strategies is a fecundity-survival trade-off and environmental factors strongly influence the evolutionary history of these strategies. In this thesis I aimed to examine the evolutionary relationships among the benthic shallow-water octopuses (subfamily Octopodinae) using a molecular phylogenetic approach. The best phylogenetic hypothesis was then used in a comparative phylogenetic analysis to examine the evolutionary history of reproductive strategies. I was interested in examining whether evolutionary transitions in egg size have been influenced by macro-environmental variation during their evolutionary history.
 A molecular phylogenetic analysis was used to reconstruct a broad-scale phylogeny of the benthic shallow-water octopuses from the amino acid sequences of two mitochondrial DNA genes: Cytochrome oxidase subunit III and Cytochrome b apoenzyme and, the nuclear DNA gene, Elongation Factor-1&#945;. Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian approaches were implemented to estimate the phylogeny and non-parametric bootstrap was used to verify confidence intervals for Bayesian topologies. Overall the genes used in this study were better suited to the examination of recent phylogenetic relationships, which has helped to resolve the relationships among closely related taxa, rather than deeper divergences among genera and species groups. The phylogenies revealed strong evidence that the genus Octopus is not a monophyletic group. Interestingly, a number of monophyletic sub-groups comprising closely related terminal taxa exist within the genus. Based on these findings it is clear that the systematics of the subfamily Octopodinae requires major revision. Deep relationships within this group remain only partially resolved and to improve resolution among distantly related species sequence data from conserved genes should be examined.
 The dichotomous reproductive strategies that exist among species of the benthic shallow-water octopuses are an exceptional life history feature as they are only one of two groups within the Cephalopoda that maintain such a dichotomy. The reconstructed pattern of evolution in inferred juvenile types showed that the planktonic juvenile type was ancestral among 22 species and three independent evolutionary transitions to the benthic juvenile type were observed with no subsequent reversals among taxa. The comparative phylogenetic analysis revealed that egg size covaries with variation in latitudinal gradient and more weakly with body size. These findings suggest that, evolutionarily, egg size is an adaptive trait that responds to a number of selection pressures including those associated with macro-environmental variation. Based on these results it is suggested that the dichotomy in egg sizes may be maintained by a fecundity-survival trade-off that responds to natural selection associated with the environmental conditions that a species inhabits.
 Under the assumption that egg size and juvenile type are tightly correlated traits I propose a number of hypotheses regarding the evolution of reproductive strategies in octopuses. Small eggs and planktonic juvenile types are likely to be the ancestral states for shallow-water octopuses in general. Based on the covariation of egg size with latitudinal variation, inter-specific evolution in both egg size and juvenile type is likely to reflect adaptations to natural selection resulting from large-scale ecological factors; a finding that is consistent with benthic marine invertebrate life history theory. Large eggs and benthic juveniles may be an adaptation to high-risk conditions such as deep-sea and/or cold environments as supported by the tendency for transitions in reproductive strategy to occur most frequently in the direction of small egg size - planktonic juvenile type to large egg - benthic juvenile type. Evidence that egg sizes are constrained by phylogeny was observed, which may also indicate a constraint on reproductive strategies such that transitions in strategy are rare.
 The dichotomous reproductive strategies that exist among species of the benthic shallow-water octopuses are an exceptional life history feature that is only observed in one other cephalopod family, the Idiosepiidae. Many other benthic marine invertebrates also maintain dual reproductive strategies between species and a large body of theory exists regarding how these traits have evolved and been maintained throughout evolutionary history. Using a comparative phylogenetic approach it was possible to investigate hypotheses generated by optimality models and experimental observations in an historical context and to examine the patterns of evolution in traits.

However, the reality for many Indigenous families is that policies have not translated into practices that fit within the cultural context of family and community, and parents have few opportunities to gain knowledge of the education process and how it affects their children.
 The Parents and Learning program views parent participation in education in Indigenous communities as home-based. It is a two year program that actively engages parents in educational activities with their children outside the constraints of the school. Development of the program was in response to Napranum parents&#8217; requests for help in preparing their children for the rigours of formal schooling. This thesis presents a process evaluation of the Parents and Learning program in Napranum. It examines how and why things happened, in addition to exploring the impact of the program in the community.
 Qualitative methodology was chosen as the most appropriate methodology for the context as it enabled me to capture both the essence of the program and the participants&#8217; perspectives. In an effort to determine the effectiveness of the program I focussed on the perceptions of the Indigenous parent participants and personnel as the main stakeholders and key informants. The research shows that the PaL program was effective in translating concern into action. By providing practical, structured support and concrete, fun activities, the PaL program has begun to unlock some of the mysteries of schooling for parents and children in Napranum. Children and parents are actively engaging in Western literacy and numeracy experiences in their own environment, using their own frameworks of interaction with the support of people they know and trust. These processes are enabling bridges to be built for their children between the culture of home and the culture of school. The identification of the core elements of the PaL program also highlights some of the processes critical in supporting and strengthening families, particularly during the early childhood years.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/70/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/70/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#8216;Being here&#8217;: heritage, belonging and place making:
 a study of community and identity formation at Avebury (England), Magnetic Island (Australia) and Ayutthaya (Thailand)</field><field name="creator">Harrington, Jane Therese</field><field name="description">This thesis looks at the way cultural heritage can be more broadly considered to include
 intangible aspects of our lives. Such intangible heritage encompasses the general values
 and worldviews of a community and enshrines a community&#8217;s character and identity.
 Through meanings, associations, values and ways of life, people individually and
 collectively create a meaningful relationship with place. Place and community are
 mutually constituted through social action and practice and the attribution of meaning in a
 process of &#8216;place making&#8217; and of reasserting belonging.
 It is recognised that communities are fluid categories that can be &#8216;re-sited&#8217; in relation to
 new questions or different places and times. Both individual and community identity are a
 form of production, and consist as a process that is never complete. That is, identity is not
 only a matter of &#8216;being&#8217; but also a process of &#8216;becoming&#8217;. By addressing case studies in
 three World Heritage listed locations &#8211; Magnetic Island (Australia), Avebury (England)
 and Ayutthaya (Thailand) &#8211; the thesis considers the dissonance between heritage as
 defined and practised through hegemonic instruments and discourses (including
 international organisations, bureaucratic structures and the Academy), and heritage as
 conceived by contemporary communities as being the aspects of their lived existence that
 they desire to retain for future generations.
 Through discussion of emplaced communities and a series of case studies, consideration
 is given to the hegemonic dominance of sanctioned determinations of heritage that
 attribute significance and in the process can mute local values and narratives. The thesis
 challenges the ongoing emphasis on tangible aspects of heritage and reviews the
 natural/cultural heritage dichotomy, demonstrating that attachments to nature are
 predicated on experiences, practices and engagements with the environment that are
 grounded in social and cultural processes. I further explore the way in which the voicing
 of opinions in a struggle over place can be regulated by prevailing scientific discourses
 and discursive fields, placing a reliance on arguments about conservation that are
 ancillary to more specific but less articulatable concerns to do with place and identity.
 Finally, I illustrate the significance of the lived traditions, rituals, ceremonies, skills and
 practices of the contemporary communities to a holistic understanding of heritage at both
 the local and broader levels.
 I conclude that it is by understanding what it is that communities find important, and how
 such attachments and values are formed, transmitted and retained to create a &#8216;sense of
 place&#8217;, that community participation in heritage can be meaningfully achieved.
 Community assertions of the aspects of their lives that can be considered important to
 pass on to their children are not enshrined in the monuments, structures and archaeology
 that heritage professionals are more likely to identify, but in the sense of belonging that
 arises through the mutual construction of community and place, reinforced through social
 practices, memories and local narratives.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/71/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/71/2/02chapter1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/71/3/03chapter2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/71/4/04chapter3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/71/5/05chapter4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/71/6/06chapter5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/71/7/07chapter6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/71/8/08chapter7.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/71/9/09chapter8.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/71/10/10chapter9.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/71/11/11chapter10.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/71/12/12references.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/71/13/13appendices.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The reproduction and recruitment of the sand dollar
 Arachnoides placenta (L.) (Echinoidea: Echinodermata)
 from differing habitats on the North Queensland coast</field><field name="creator">Haycock, Lucy Jessica</field><field name="description">The reproductive periodicity, recruitment and population studies of the intertidal
 Indo-Pacific echinoid, Arachnoides placenta (Linnaeus), were investigated from April
 2001 to September 2002 at sites along 650km of the north Queensland coast, Australia.
 Three locations were sampled, comprising Mission Beach; Pallarenda Beach
 Townsville; and the Mackay region. A. placenta is a dominant macro-organism at all
 sites sampled, individuals of all sizes are found across the entire stretch of the beach
 terrace but are rarely evenly distributed, displaying a preference for pools and ripples
 containing wet sand. Despite patchiness a significant decrease in density downshore was
 observed in 11 / 17 transects laid at Pallarenda Beach, 2001 (p = &lt;0.05). Significant
 differences in density were observed between all sites (p = 0.000) and even over
 distances of metres (p = 0.006). A maximum density of 88 individuals m-2 was recorded
 at Mackay in 2002.
 There was also clear temporal and spatial variation in the size-frequency of the
 population at Pallarenda Beach and significant differences in test diameter between sites
 (p = 0.000) which clearly shows no effect of latitude on test diameter. At Pallarenda
 Beach test diameter was observed to increase with distance downshore in 13 / 17
 transects. Test diameter at Bucasia Beach, Mackay on the contrary decreased with
 distance downshore. No relationship between test diameter and population size was
 observed.
 Significant differences in population density and size-frequency data even over scales of
 just metres suggest that discrete differences in abiotic or biotic factors, particularly
 sediment grain size, moisture and protection from wave action, between sites are
 enough to produce significant variations between populations.
 Growth of A. placenta from settlement demonstrates an s-shaped growth curve
 that is typical of a number of echinoid species. From a size of approximately 10mm
 growth assumes a linear phase which slows at a size of 25mm, at which size individuals
 are estimated to be 3 or 4 years old.
 The reproductive periodicity of Arachnoides placenta exhibited an overall
 seasonal cycle with a period of gamete growth and accumulation from December to
 February culminating in a March to May main spawning period. Gametogenic patterns
 at Pallarenda Beach indicate the breeding season of A. placenta coincides with the start
 of a decline in sea water temperatures that occurs from March (26 &#8211; 28 oC) which reaches a minimum over the months of June &#8211; August (22 &#8211; 24 oC). Partial spawning
 was observed in some individuals to June/July with a few spawning until September at
 Pallarenda Beach, indicating the continuation of spawning until temperatures reached a
 minimum. Over the range studied, A. placenta experienced similar annual air/sea water
 cycles and relatively comparable rainfall cycles. Air temperatures varied a maximum of
 &#177;8 oC from those of Townsville, possibly accounting for minimal differences in
 gametogenesis between sites. Spawning was only synchronous between males and
 females during months of the major spawning period (March to July), during which
 female gonads returned to the recovering condition within a month or less of spawning.
 From July to November no female gonads were in the late mature stage and a very slow
 rate of gametogenesis was observed. In males, 30-100% of individuals in all populations
 had ripe gonads throughout both years except June and September 2002 in Mackay. A
 percentage of all male gonads were always in the spent stage, indicating recovery takes
 longer than a month.
 Significant numbers of newly settled recruits occur within the sediment from
 March &#8211; May at all sites, which strongly correlates with the timing of the annual
 gametogenic cycle of adults. The density of recruits downshore at Pallarenda Beach in
 2001 demonstrate a clear patchy distribution, however a significant decrease in
 individuals downshore was observed in three out of six months of sampling (p = &lt;0.05).
 Newly settled recruits prefer the middle to lower section of the beach terrace until a size
 of around 10mm is reached, when these individuals show a preference for the inhabiting
 the upper &#8211;middle section of the beach terrace. Such size-related positions on the beach
 terrace point to optimal grain-size preference possibly related to feeding and movement.
 There does not appear to be an adult-larval attraction during settlement.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/72/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/72/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dugong behaviour and responses to human influences</field><field name="creator">Hodgson, Amanda Jane</field><field name="description">Knowledge of the behavioural ecology of a species is important for the development of
 conservation initiatives. With an understanding of how behaviour has evolved under
 given environmental and phylogenic constraints, it is possible to predict the response of
 a population to novel circumstances such as anthropogenic disturbance. Little is known
 about many aspects of the behaviour of dugongs (Dugong dugon). This species is
 difficult to observe as dugongs are benthic feeders, usually occurring in turbid waters.
 They tend to be wary of boats or divers and individuals cannot easily be distinguished.
 As dugongs occur in shallow, coastal waters, they are particularly vulnerable to human
 impacts; however, these impacts have not previously been quantified through direct
 observations of dugong behaviour.
 To overcome the difficulties in observing dugongs, I developed a blimp-cam, which
 allowed me to video dugongs from a blimp tethered to my research vessel. The use of
 the blimp-cam was facilitated by selecting Moreton Bay, Queensland, as my study site,
 where dugongs are readily located in clear, shallow waters. I used this technology to
 obtain baseline information about dugong behaviour, and investigated the function of
 the large herds persistently formed by dugongs in Moreton Bay. I then observed the
 response of dugongs to boats and pingers (acoustic alarms used on fishing nets to
 reduce marine mammal bycatch) to determine the risk of boat strikes and effects of
 disturbance from these two sound sources.
 At a height of 50m the blimp-cam provided an overhead view of dugongs at water
 depths of up to 4m, and distances of up to 200 m via a monitor on board the research
 vessel. Using a remote control, I could scan large herds of dugongs or continually
 observe individuals. Through focal follows of individual dugongs I developed an
 ethogram and a daily time budget for dugongs in Moreton Bay.
 Dugongs spent most of their time feeding (41%), travelling (32%), and surfacing
 (ascending to, and descending from, surface, 18%), and relatively little time resting
 (7%), socialising (6%) or rolling (1%). Environmental variables accounted for little of
 the variability in the proportion of time dugongs spent in each behavioural category.
 Time budgets did not differ significantly between single individuals and mothers with calves. However, mothers spent significantly more time feeding and surfacing, and less
 time travelling than their calves. Calves were observed suckling for mean bout lengths
 of 87 s. The mean submergence time for all individuals was 75 s, but was significantly
 shorter for calves (72 s) in comparison to their mothers (82 s). Submergence times were
 not affected by depth (&lt; or &#8805; 1.5 m), but were affected by behaviour.
 Dugongs spent 3.5% of the day resting at the surface of the water, during which time
 they are particularly vulnerable to boat strike. Mother-calf pairs appear most vulnerable
 to boat strike because they spend more time near the surface than single individuals.
 Calves are especially vulnerable as they rise or submerge by crossing onto their
 mother&#8217;s back during a quarter of their dives, and spent 13% of their time travelling and
 resting over their mothers&#8217; back.
 I found that individual dugongs spent significantly more time feeding while in large,
 dense herds than when in smaller groups or scattered, suggesting that these herds are
 formed primarily to facilitate feeding. Dugongs did not seek large herds for resting, and
 calves were less likely to be surrounded by dugongs other than their mothers, than
 single individuals. These observations suggest that dugongs do not shelter in herds
 when most vulnerable to shark attack, and that herds are unlikely to have a predatory
 defence function. Herd structure was fluid, with individuals changing nearest
 neighbours after an average of 1 min, and showing no obvious preference for nearest
 neighbour type (single individual or mother-calf pair). Thus there was no evidence of a
 social function for these herds. My results support the theory that seagrass distribution
 and seasonality, sediment type, a lack of other disturbance of seagrass beds, and a yearround
 presence of dugongs on the Moreton Banks facilitate cultivation grazing.
 Observations of the response of dugongs to boats passing opportunistically provided
 information on the risk of boat strikes. Unlike controlled passes which were restricted to
 the below-planing speed limit of the study area, independent boats were often travelling
 above this limit. Only boats travelling above planing speed were observed passing
 directly over the top of dugongs. I hypothesise that the distance of the flight threshold
 for dugongs remains constant regardless of boat speed. Thus the speed of an
 approaching boat determines the time dugongs have to evade the boat, and speed is the
 main factor affecting the risk of boat strikes. Controlled experiments were conducted to determine the effects of boats on dugong
 behaviour. The behaviour of focal dugongs during a 4.5 min time sample was not
 significantly affected by whether there was a boat passing, the number of consecutive
 passes made (1 to 5 passes), or whether the pass was continuous or included a stop and
 restart during the pass. During the subsurface interval of the focal dugong that
 corresponded with the control boat&#8217;s closest approach time, the travel distance, travel
 direction and subsurface time were not correlated with the boat&#8217;s approach distance.
 However, during this subsurface interval dugongs were less likely to remain feeding if
 the boat passed within 50 m than if it passed at a greater distance. Mass movements of
 dugong feeding herds in response to boats were obvious but only lasted an average of
 122 sec. These movements occurred in response to boats passing at all speeds, and at
 distances of less than 50 m to over 500 m. Relatively low levels of boat traffic in
 Moreton Bay in winter mean that a maximum 0.8 &#8211; 6% of feeding time may be
 interrupted by boats. However, if the number of boats registered in Queensland
 continues to increase at the current rate, the rate of disturbance is likely to increase.
 The response of dugongs to pingers was tested to determine whether these alarms may
 prevent dugongs from using important habitat areas. An array of two 10kHz &#8216;BASA&#8217;
 pingers did not cause an observable response by dugongs. There was no significant
 difference in the rate of dugong movement away from the focal arena surrounding the
 pingers, orientation of the dugongs, or the presence or absence of feeding plumes, while
 the pingers were active compared to when inactive.
 The observed responses suggest that boat strikes are currently a bigger threat to dugongs
 than disturbance from boats or pingers, and support speed restrictions for boats in areas
 commonly used by dugongs. My results also reflect the need for detailed risk
 assessments to be conducted in areas where dugong habitat overlaps with areas of high
 boat traffic, and prior to future developments that will increase boat traffic. Further
 studies that build on the fundamental knowledge of dugong behaviour gained through
 this research will provide an understanding of human impacts in a wide range of
 habitats and aid in developing appropriate anthropogenic mortality targets for dugongs.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/73/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/73/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Life history variation and reproductive success in the common brushtail possum, Trichosurus vulpecula</field><field name="creator">Isaac, Joanne</field><field name="description">Life history theory aims to describe and explain patterns in the life cycles of organisms and relate these patterns to intrinsic and extrinsic influences.

This thesis investigates life history variation, and the influence of this variation on reproductive strategy and success, among individuals in an arboreal marsupial, the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula).
 A population of T. vulpecula was studied from 2001-2004 on Magnetic Island, north Queensland; the population was censused each month by live-trapping. Demographic changes in the population were modelled using capture-mark-recapture data. The population size remained stable over the study period and there was little temporal variation in recruitment or survival. T. vulpecula on Magnetic Island displayed life history traits similar to those reported for other populations of the species. The majority (&gt;80%) of females began to reproduce at the age of two and the main birth period occurred in the autumn months of April and May. Some females went on to produce a second young in the spring, after successfully raising a first. Males became sexually mature at the age of three. Survival, body mass and body condition declined in both males and females after the age of six, although the declines were more pronounced in males.
 Variation in life history was strongly related to differences in female reproductive strategy and success. In terms of somatic investment, older females invested significantly more into individual offspring than younger females; older females also gave birth earlier in the season and were more likely to produce a second offspring in the spring birth cohort. Maternal age also influenced the birth sex ratio; young, primiparous females gave birth to significantly more male offspring than older females, regardless of their condition while older, multiparous females were more likely to give birth to a male offspring when in good condition.
 The extent of male biased sexual dimorphism in T. vulpecula was extremely variable among 11 populations in northern Australia. Dimorphism was related to seasonality of breeding, being greatest in populations where births occurred all year round. Mean body mass of male possums also decreased with increasing population density, while there was no effect of density on female mass. There was also some evidence that population density influenced the degree of breeding synchrony within populations, particularly in locations with a more seasonal climate.
 In the Magnetic Island population, mating effort also varied considerably among male possums and young males lost more mass during the mating period than did older males. There was also some indication that males demonstrated age-specific variation in mating behaviour, which may be related to their size and experience.
 The results of my study show that life history traits in both male and female T. vulpecula are phenotypically plastic. Age-specific variation in reproductive strategy was found in both male and female possums and is likely associated with the trade-off between current and future reproduction. Increased reproductive effort in older females also appears to entail significant costs in terms of an associated decline in survival, condition and body mass. Variation in body condition also influenced offspring sex allocation in females and is most probably an adaptation to maximise LRS. Male possums displayed a more pronounced decline in survival and condition after the age of five compared to females and this may be a direct cost of increasing mating effort as a young adult.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/74/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/74/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Valuing ecosystem services in a green economy
</field><field name="creator">Curtis, Ian Arthur</field><field name="description">SCOPE: Ecosystems are being degraded and destroyed worldwide at a rate unprecedented in human history. Accordingly a great deal of interest is currently being focussed on ecosystems, the role they play in planetary life support, and the need for a market mechanism to conserve these formerly regarded 'free' goods and services. This research project is concerned with the various divisions or branches within economics dealing with environmental valuation, including applied economics in the form of valuation practice, environmental science, and ecology. It is thus both multi-disciplinary and interdisciplinary and has as its central theme the use of a surrogate market to establish shadow prices for ecosystem services. 
 METHODOLOGY: Twenty ecosystem attributes were identified as being common to all ecosystems depending on the level of integrity, and ranked in order of importance on the basis of a range of criteria. This was achieved by a systematic analysis, namely a multiple criteria analysis, and a social study, in the form of a Delphi philosophical inquiry. These two methods incorporated many different perspectives: namely anthropocentric, utilitarian (economic), ecological, aesthetics, equity, risk and uncertainty. The weightings provided by the panellists were non-pecuniary, and as such were not subject to any bias or odium that may have been associated with putting monetary values on nature&#8217;s gifts. The non-pecuniary weightings assigned by the panellists were converted to dollar values by empirically linking them to the surrogate market, namely the property market in the region, and calculating the value of a flow of benefits emanating from them (the economic rent). A valuation table was devised to assess the ecosystem integrity of individual ecosystems on private or public land and a conceptual model devised for landscapes. The case study area was the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area of northeast Queensland.
 RESULTS: The Delphi panel reached consensus in all three rounds of questionnaires, and the weights provided for the twenty attributes for all three models in the multiple criteria analysis showed a significant level of agreement between the disciplines represented on the panel. The ten ecosystem services ranked most important were: biodiversity; refugia; erosion control/soil and sediment retention; genetic resources; gas regulation; climate regulation; biological control; purification (clean air, water); disturbance regulation; and aesthetics, in that order. The total value of ecosystem goods and services in all the tenure categories in the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area (8,944 km2) was determined to be in the range AUD$188 to $211 million year-1, or AUD$210 to $236 ha-1yr-1 across tenure categories. The individual ecosystem services mentioned above ranged from AUD$18.6 to $20.9 million year-1 for biodiversity down to AUD$10.2 to $11.4 million year-1 for aesthetics. The value of individual ecosystem services constrained within a fully intact suite of ecosystem goods and services was found to be consistent with the value of all other uses to which land is put in a bioregion and with other avenues of investment in the economic system, and will increase proportionate to the human population density, and hence scarcity of ecosystem services.
 CONCLUSION: The combination of revealed preferences in a surrogate market as the empirical baseline for the whole suite of ecosystem services in a bioregion or Local Government Area, along with the expressed preferences of a group of experts as to the importance of each individual good or service, provides the theoretical and practical justification for the acceptance of the technique as a means of establishing opening prices in a future trading market. Being linked to the value of real property and hence population density in a region, it provides a key insight into the status and thus value of ecosystems services provided by public and private land, including scarcity. The most critical recommendation to policy and decision-makers emanating from this research is the requirement that environmental impacts arising from development projects, policies or proposals be properly identified, the magnitude of the impact properly assessed, and mitigation of the impacts strictly enforced. The same applies for environmental pollution, damage and degradation with legal liability apparent. Legislation is required to be enacted which will lead to the need for rigorous environmental valuation procedures that have empirical verification and will stand scrutiny in a court of law. The technique expounded in this thesis is such a procedure.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/76/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/76/2/02chapter1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/76/3/03section1chapters2-6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/76/4/04section2chapters7-12.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/76/5/05section3chapters13-14.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/76/6/06referencelist.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/76/7/07appendices.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conilurine Rodent Evolution: The role of ecology in modifying evolutionary consequences of environmental change</field><field name="creator">Ford, Frederick David</field><field name="description">Conilurine rodents are the most speciose and ecologically diverse rodent group within Australia. Previous research has demonstrated that conilurines are members of a larger Australasian Murid tribe, the Hydromyini, and are generally thought to be an endemic Australian radiation with a fossil history dating to the mid Pliocene. However, monophyly of conilurines is not well established due to the distant placement of some genera in recent systematic studies. I investigated the evolution of conilurine rodents using a combination of molecular and ecological techniques. I examined phylogenetic relationships among all Australian rodent genera using the mitochondrial control region and a nuclear intron (DHFR 1). These results suggested that conilurines are monophyletic, and that unresolved generic relationships within the group are the product of an early savannah radiation. Building on the results of systematic studies, I examined patterns of speciation and population divergence in model species and species groups. Bioclimatic range modelling and some ecological studies were performed to aid interpretation of molecular evolution within these groups. The overall goal of this thesis is to provide a detailed account of some evolutionary processes affecting an interesting group for which such information is lacking, and to highlight the potential of conilurines for evolutionary study in an Australian context. A more specific goal is to investigate the effect that species ecology has on altering the evolutionary response of different species to the same environmental stimuli.
 Molecular studies identified a number of taxonomic issues within the group. The genera Notomys, Mastacomys and Pseudomys formed a monophyletic group identified by previous studies. Mastacomys was placed within Pseudomys, with which it was recently synonymised, and Notomys was not clearly separable from Pseudomys. Both Notomys and Mastacomys should be recognised as genera. As a result, Pseudomys was split into several smaller genera. These included resurrection of the genus Thetomys for P. gracilicaudatus and P. nanus, and creation of a new genus Phorolithomys for the recently described pebble-mound mice. A further three groups are apparent within Pseudomys, but splitting of these at the generic level is contingent on further resolving the placement of several species among them. Some individuals previously described as P. delicatulus from north-western Australia appear to be a morphologically cryptic species, and were placed outside the P. delicatulus/ novaehollandiae group in phylogenetic trees. The subspecies P. delicatulus mimulus has no genetic basis. Pseudomys laborifex is probably a subspecies of P. johnsoni, which is an unexpected result given the distribution of P. laborifex in the Kimberley, a region anticipated to contain the sib-taxon to the Top End P. calabyi.
 Phylogeographic studies of variation in the mitochondrial control region revealed significant differences in the evolution of species groups as result of their differing ecologies. This contrast centres on the morphologically similar pebble-mound mice and delicate mouse group. These are the largest species groups within the current genus Pseudomys. Pebble-mound mice are characterised by the fact that they require pebbly habitat for breeding, and have therefore speciated in allopatry due to erosion and fragmentation of that habitat. Climatic change has also affected pebble-mound mice, and has driven recurrent extinction processes, in part re-enforced by the inability of pebble-mound mice to track climatic change across pebble-free habitats.
 The delicate mouse group have distributions primarily determined by climate. This means they are periodically isolated and bottlenecked, but also experience secondary contact when conditions permit range expansion. A major finding was that there is no taxon corresponding to Pseudomys pilligaensis, and that individuals of both P. delicatulus and P. novaehollandiae have been included within that species. The genetic distinctness of P. novaehollandiae from P. delicatulus was no greater than that among individuals of P. delicatulus. Whether P. delicatulus and P. novaehollandiae represent sib-species or subspecies was not resolved, but evidence of clinal morphology and probable interbreeding suggests that they have not yet speciated. Pseudomys hermannsburgensis, an arid zone member of the delicate mice, showed little genetic variability, and no geographical structuring across a very large distribution. This result is consistent with ecological studies that show the species possesses morphological adaptations to aridity and exists in relatively mobile populations. A similar result was found for the co-distributed P. desertor. Patterns of genetic structuring are not predictable based on crude habitat preference. It was thought a priori that Zyzomys argurus was a taxon with a similar habitat preference to pebble-mound mice and that it would also exhibit deep genetic structuring between allopatric populations found in rocky habitats across northern Australia. Previous isozyme studies did not find such a relationship, and this was confirmed by mtDNA sequencing. Unlike most other study species, there was no signal from the last glacial maximum, despite the fact that Z. argurus would not have been able to track climate change as many species did. A broad climatic tolerance and good dispersal ability seem to explain the lack of population structuring.
 Amplification of nuclear copies of the mitochondrial control region hampered efforts to study the chestnut mice, P. gracilicaudatus and P. nanus. However, three clean control region sequences were obtained that apparently confirmed currently recognised species boundaries. Nuclear copies were also amplified from the pebble-mound mice, but primers were designed that prevented their hindrance of phylogeographic studies.
 The characterisation of evolution among conilurine rodents presented here reveals that species ecology clearly accounts for many differences in patterns of population divergence and speciation. I suggest that ecological interpretation of evolutionary pattern can be extended to a general contrast between the entire conilurine assemblage and marsupials.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/77/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/77/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Protectors and interpreters of the outback: A study of the emerging occupation of the Savannah Guide</field><field name="creator">Hillman, Wendy</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the emergence of the occupation of the ecotour guide as part of an expanding service economy. Qualitative methods, using participant observation and open ended, in-depth interviewing techniques, were used for the generation of insights and theory from the data.
 From a sociological perspective, it is apparent that these tour guides provide an informed, interpretive guided ecotourism experience in the Australian outback. Their interpretive &#8216;facts&#8217; are acquired from life experience in the bush. They are workers in an industry that, in some instances, offers little reward or return for extreme working conditions.
 This study explores salient issues related to the perceived professionalisation of a collective group of tourism business individuals called Savannah Guides. The guides&#8217; philosophy is based on a collective sense of identity and recognition as an exclusive ecotourism organisation. This has been used as a means of positioning themselves in the competitive ecotourism market. Exclusivity and elitism are practiced by the guides to exclude individuals who do not conform to their organisational standards and codes of conduct. The organisation has regimented levels of attainment and can be considered as quasi-militaristic in its orientation. The guides have implemented various forms of assessment and training that serve as a measurement of competency and uniformity.
 The guides present themselves to the public mainly through their individual tourism businesses. Emotional labour is one of the ways they interact with the public on their tours. They incorporate the emotional side of their interpretive work into their tourist products and tours, through the ways they impart both education and knowledge to the tourists. Their educative and cultural expertise is also informed by usage of emotional labour.
 Concern for, and an extensive knowledge of the environment, are also components of their specialised form of guiding. Many of the guides see work in the ecotourism industry as a form of alternative employment, and as an option to the decline in rural employment. Others perceive a niche for this type of tourism and exploit the opportunity. This thesis details the guides&#8217; way of life as individuals within the Savannah Guides organisation and the ecotourist industry.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/79/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/79/2/02chapter1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/79/3/03chapter2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/79/4/04chapter3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/79/5/05chapter4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/79/6/06chaper5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/79/7/07chapter6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/79/8/08chapter7.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/79/9/09chapter8.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/79/10/10references.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/79/11/11appendicesA-F.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/79/12/12appendicesG-H.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/79/13/13appendixI.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/79/14/14glossary.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of anterior patterning genes in the staghorn coral, Acropora millepora(Cnidaria; Anthozoa; Scleractinia)</field><field name="creator">Hislop, Nikki Rochelle</field><field name="description">To a surprising extent, molecular mechanisms underlying many aspects of development
 are conserved across the higher (bilateral and triploblastic) Metazoa, but the degree to
 which similar mechanisms apply to non-bilateral and diploblastic animals such as
 cnidarians is unclear. The aim of this thesis was to characterise genes homologous to
 those that play key roles in anterior patterning in bilaterians, in the basal cnidarian
 Acropora millepora.
 In Acropora, a gene clearly related to the ems/Emx family was shown to be expressed in
 a subset of presumed neurons, restricted along the oral-aboral (O/A) axis to the aboral
 end of the planula larva, in a pattern overlapping that of cnox2-Am, the Acropora
 ind/Gsx homolog. Hence, key components of both anterior-posterior (A/P) and dorsalventral
 (D/V) patterning systems of higher animals are differentially expressed along
 the single (O/A) overt body axis of the Acropora planula. During metamorphosis, emx-
 Am expression is significantly reduced, corresponding to the degeneration of the
 nervous system observed prior to settlement (Ball et al., unpublished). After settlement,
 expression of emx-Am is again detected in a subset of neurons, although an axis-related
 pattern of distribution is not apparent. Yeast-one hybrid and electrophoretic mobility
 shift assays (EMSA) were used to identify candidate target sites for the Emx-Am
 homeodomain and to examine its DNA-binding behaviour in vitro. Yeast-one hybrid
 experiments identified three regions within the Acropora genome containing putative
 Emx-Am binding sites, and further characterisation of these regions attempted to
 identify potential downstream targets of the Emx-Am homeodomain. Data regarding
 downstream targets of Ems/Emx proteins is limited, but EMSA provided novel
 evidence that Ems/Emx homeodomains may be able dimerise on TAAT half sites, a
 characteristic feature of many ANTP-related proteins.
 In Drosophila, the Tailless nuclear receptor is a direct regulator of ems; for this reason
 the expression of tlx-Am, an Acropora gene encoding a protein clearly related to
 Tailless, was studied. In addition to its patterns of expression, the tlx-Am locus was also
 characterised, but this analysis revealed that a similar regulatory relationship with ems
 is unlikely to exist in the coral. Attempts to clone the Acropora homolog of a Hydra prdl-a gene led to the fortuitous
 identification of four paired-like genes. Although none of these appears to be strictly
 orthologous with prdl-a, the sequences and expression patterns of these genes provided
 some novel insights into the evolution of the Paired superfamily of homeodomain
 proteins. One of these genes (hbn-Am) is orthologous with Drosophila homeobrain,
 and appears to be a very early ectodermal marker during coral development. hbn-Am is
 expressed in a region corresponding to the presumptive ectoderm, in a pattern that is
 complimentary and mutually exclusive to that of the coral snail homolog (snail-Am),
 suggesting that these genes interact.
 Two of the paired-like genes identified are clearly related and were shown to be
 organised in tandem in the Acropora genome. Two other cases of tightly linked pairs of
 related genes were also identified, suggesting that a high proportion of coral genes may
 be organised in this way.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/80/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/80/2/02chapter1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/80/3/03chapter2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/80/4/04chapter3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/80/5/05chapter4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/80/6/06chapter5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/80/7/07chapter6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/80/8/08References.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/80/9/09Appendix.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecological significance of body size in tropical wrasses(Pisces : Labridae)</field><field name="creator">Hubble, Marc</field><field name="description">Among terrestrial organisms, body size exhibits predictable relationships with many characteristics including growth rate, mortality rate, longevity, reproductive traits, abundance, species richness and habitat use. However, the majority of studies
 identifying such relationships have looked at a limited range of terrestrial taxa, in particular mammals, birds and beetles. These patterns have received much less attention among marine organisms and consequently their generality is questionable. Factors influencing growth of organisms in terrestrial and marine environments may be
 fundamentally different. This variation could result in considerable differences in growth processes among marine and terrestrial organisms and influence constraints on
 body size among species in these environments. The principal aim of this study was to identify whether numerous body size-related patterns observed in terrestrial taxa were repeated in a group of coral reef fishes, and assess reasons for differences when
 predicted relationships were not detected.
 This study employed a multispecific comparative approach to examine life history and ecological correlates of body size in coral reef fishes of the wrasse family (Pisces:
 Labridae), a group in which species range in length from 4cm to over 2m. To account for the influence of evolutionary history of species on the patterns observed, a working hypothesis for a wrasse phylogeny was derived for the sampled species. This phylogeny was integrated into the analyses for Chapters 2 and 3 of this thesis.
 The study comprised four main data chapters examining relationships between body size and a range of life history traits and other ecological characteristics. In
 Chapter 2, the relationships between maximum body size of species and growth rate, mortality rate and longevity were examined among ten species of wrasses which
 encompassed a ten-fold size range. Based on current theory it was predicted that there should be a positive relationship between maximum size of species and maximum age and a corresponding negative relationship between maximum species size and mortality rate. Both of these relationships were detected for the wrasses studied here. Conceptual models indicating ways in which differences among body sizes of fish species can arise
 were developed and tested. It was found that in some species larger size was simply attained by growing at the same rate as smaller species but for a longer period of time. In other species faster growth enabled the attainment of larger body size but at the cost iiof
 shortened life-span. There was limited evidence that by growing faster individuals became larger and less susceptible to predation sooner, resulting in larger body sizes and longer life spans. A further idea was that smaller species are smaller because they have determinate growth and stop growing sooner than larger species. Wrasse species studied here exhibited the range from indeterminate to determinate growth but there was
 no apparent relationship between maximum body size of species and growth strategy.
 In Chapter 3 covariation between maximum size of species and reproductive characteristics was explored. It was predicted that smaller species should mature and
 change sex at a smaller proportion of maximum size and proportionally earlier in life than larger species. They were also expected to have greater reproductive effort than
 larger species. Despite this, none of these relationships between maximum species size and reproductive traits were evident. Relationships between maximum size and size at
 maturity and sex change were in fact opposite to those expected as smaller species matured and changed sex at a greater proportion of maximum size than larger species.
 Similarly, short-lived species matured and changed sex proportionally later in life than long-lived species. In general, body size appeared more important than age in
 determining when maturation and sex change occurred both among and within species. Energy invested per reproductive episode was not significantly related to species body size.
 In Chapter 4, covariation among body size, growth rate, longevity, reproductive effort and size/age at maturity and size/age at sex change was examined in the wrasse
 Halichoeres melanurus. Individuals were sampled at four locations along a latitudinal cline. Consistent with patterns identified to date it was predicted that with an increase in latitude there should be a decrease in growth rate, and an increase in body size and longevity. Initial growth rate was slightly slower at the two higher latitude locations and the maximum body size and maximum age of individuals within populations did tend to increase with an increase in latitude. It was also considered that an increase in latitude should be associated with an increase in the proportion of adult size and age attained
 before maturation and sex change, and an increase in reproductive effort. However, there was no consistent relationship between the latitude at which individuals were
 sampled and the proportion of maximum size/age attained at maturity or sex change. In addition reproductive effort of individuals did not vary predictably as latitude increased.
 Individuals collected at the Palm Islands matured relatively earlier, exhibited greater iiireproductive
 effort and changed sex proportionally earlier in life than those collected at Kimbe Bay, Lizard Island and Heron Island.
 In Chapter 5, relationships between body size and ecological characteristics including local abundance, species richness, habitat use and depth range, were
 investigated among all wrasse species present at a range of locations. Based on patterns identified within both marine and terrestrial taxa it was predicted that the smallest species would not be the most abundant with abundances peaking in species of small to intermediate size. Very large species were expected to have low abundances. This relationship was expressed for the wrasse species examined here. In addition, the body size-species richness distribution of wrasses at a number of locations was log normal, with many species of small to intermediate size and low numbers of very small or very large species. Smaller reef fish species were expected to be associated with a smaller range of microhabitats than larger species, be more habitat specific and have smaller depth ranges than larger species. The small wrasse species examined here were found to use a small, intermediate or large diversity of available microhabitats, whereas the
 larger species consistently used a wide diversity of microhabitats. Depth ranges of small species lay on a continuum from very small to very large, whereas larger species consistently had large depth ranges.
 Variation between some of the patterns observed in this study and those described in previous studies, demonstrates the need to replicate similar studies in a wide range of organisms inhabiting a wide range of habitats before their generality can be assessed.
 Repeating similar studies among species within a large range of reef fish families is crucial to determine the utility of species body size as a predictor of life history
 characteristics and other ecological variables in reef fishes.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/81/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/81/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular phylogeny, temporal patterns of lineage
 diversification and phylogeography of the surgeonfish genus
 Naso (Acanthuridae)</field><field name="creator">Klanten, Selma O.</field><field name="description">A species-level phylogeny was constructed for all described (19) Naso species (Family:
 Acanthuridae) using three markers in combination, one nuclear (ETS2) and two
 mitochondrial (16S rRNA and cytochrome b). A number of taxa representing species
 from all acanthurid genera were included to generate a genus-level (total of 38 species)
 phylogeny of the order Acanthuroidei (surgeonfishes). Maximum likelihood, maximum
 parsimony and Bayesian inference analyses produced similar tree topologies, which
 confirmed the previously proposed genus-level relationships and resolved for the first
 time inter-specific relationships of all species of the monophyletic genus Naso. Species
 of the genus Naso segregated into four major sub-clades, with members of the subgenus
 Axinurus appearing basal. This molecular phylogeny was then used to examine
 hypotheses about the evolutionary relationships among species of Naso. This study
 demonstrates that distinct foraging modes and specialised body shapes arose
 independently at different times in the evolutionary history of the genus. Members of
 the subgenus Axinurus, characterised by a scombriform morphology, caudal fin
 structure and pelagic foraging mode, were consistently placed basal to the remaining
 Naso species, suggesting that pelagic foraging is plesiomorphic and benthic foraging
 derived in this genus.
 The genus-level phylogeny (nuclear marker, ETS2) was used to obtain a range of age
 estimates for the most recent common ancestor of the genus Naso. These age estimates
 (range of 52MY to 43.3MY) were then used to estimate divergence times (by
 nonparametric rate smoothing method) of the nodes, giving rise to extant Naso species
 using the combined sequence data (from all loci). The reconstruction of the pattern of
 divergence of extant species indicates two sequences of events. The basal species
 characterised by pelagic foraging modes arose during the Eocene and Oligocene. Most
 of the remaining Naso species, including those characterised by benthic foraging, arose
 over a period of 20MY during the Miocene. Diversification during this period was
 associated with major plate tectonic and glaciation events, resulting in changes in sea
 level, ocean temperature and productivity regimes.
 To examine further speciation events and the underlying processes, several comparative
 phylogeographic studies were undertaken. For this purpose, a Naso-specific fast evolving mitochondrial marker was designed from the control region (d-loop). Firstly, a
 widely distributed species N. vlamingii, was selected to examine genetic connectivity
 and diversity throughout its distribution in the Indo-Pacific Ocean. Although very weak
 (overall Fst 0.005) genetic differentiation was obtained for this species over its sampled
 range, suggesting gene flow, there was some evidence of isolation by distance at the
 largest spatial scale (between Seychelles and the Philippines). This however, may be
 due to lack of samples from the Indian Ocean. There was no subdivision into distinct
 geographic regions, hence no evidence of cryptic speciation across the range sampled in
 this study, despite the presence of the central Indian Ocean barrier in its distribution
 range. Diversity indices (haplotype, h and nucleotide, p) were extremely high (h = 1.0
 and p = 15.1%), indicating that this species has had a long, but unstable evolutionary
 history, which has repeatedly allowed populations to diverge in isolation and to make
 secondary contact subsequently. A haplotype tree identified deep divergences for this
 species, suggesting that isolated populations diverged at times of low sea level. The lack
 of geographic partitioning in this species suggests that secondary contact was made
 between previously isolated and divergent populations at times of elevated sea level.
 The high dispersive capacity of the species is what allows secondary contact to occur
 between temporarily isolated populations.
 Additionally, two sister species pairs were selected for comparative phylogeographic
 studies. One pair (N. lituratus&#8211; N. elegans) spanned the same distribution range as N.
 vlamingii, but the species pair was partitioned by ocean basins across this range (Indian-
 /Pacific Ocean). The second pair (N. tuberosus &#8211; N. tonganus) has an even more
 restricted distribution range (west Indian-/west Pacific Ocean) and was also partitioned
 by ocean basins. The two sister species diverged allopatrically, and species of both
 sister pairs (N. lituratus&#8211; N. elegans and N. tuberosus &#8211; N. tonganus) segregated into
 distinct clades. There was no distinct geographic subdivision throughout the sampling
 range for any of these species. Instead, low levels of genetic differentiation were
 recorded among populations of each species (overall Fst values ranged from 0.005 to -
 0.001) suggesting high levels of gene flow. Despite the presence of gene flow among
 populations there was some indication of reduced gene flow across the Indian Ocean
 (between Amirante of Seychelles and Cocos Keeling Island) for N. elegans. There was no indication of gene flow between species in either of the sister pairs (N.
 lituratus &#8211; N. elegans Fst =0.75 and N. tuberosus &#8211; N. tonganus Fst =0.71), despite the
 fact that each pair was considered a single species as recently as 2001 and 2002
 respectively. This indicates reproductive isolation, despite the potential for extensive
 dispersal in these species. The diversity indices were high for all of the species (h = 0.90
 &#8211; 1.00, p = 9.0 &#8211; 11.6%; h = 1.00, p = 4.2 &#8211; 6.4% respectively), indicating deep
 divergences between haplotypes, as was the case for N. vlamingii. Several factors
 probably contribute to the population genetic structure of all five species: certain life
 history traits such as an extensive pelagic larval duration (up to 3 months) in
 combination with the ability of larvae to swim actively for extended periods, their long
 evolutionary history, the longevity (reach 30 &#8211; 40 years) and relatively short time to
 reach reproductive maturity coupled with overlapping generations (offspring)
 reproducing. The dispersive capacities of N. vlamingii are clearly the greatest of the five
 species studied, and may be attributed to the semi-pelagic adult lifestyle combined with
 the pelagic larval duration and a generalist dietary habit of this species.
 This study has demonstrated that by applying a hierarchical approach (phylogenetic,
 temporal, and phylogeographic) in combination with biological, ecological and
 historical perspectives, it has been possible to elucidate the processes important in the
 diversification of the genus Naso.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/82/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/82/2/02chapter1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/82/3/03chapter2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/82/4/04chapter3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/82/5/05chapter4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/82/6/06chapter5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/82/7/07chapter6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/82/8/08chapter7.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/82/9/09chapter8.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/82/10/10references.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/82/11/11appendices.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Romancing the Reef: history, heritage and the hyper-real</field><field name="creator">Pocock, Celmara Anne</field><field name="description">The Great Barrier Reef is regarded as one of the natural wonders of the world and is
 recognised as having World Heritage significance. The wealth and complexity of its
 natural attributes form the basis of a rich and complementary human history. However,
 management of the region is focused on the conservation of natural attributes,
 sometimes at the cost of human interests and cultural values. This is symptomatic of the
 way in which many heritage properties are managed and is a source of problems in the
 identification and interpretation of heritage. There is a need to better understand the
 human dimensions of such &#8216;natural wonders&#8217; to ensure effective management. In order
 to address some of these issues, this thesis explores visitor experiences and knowledge
 of the Great Barrier Reef with a particular focus on the non-local experiences and
 knowledge that underpin the region&#8217;s global recognition.
 One of the major issues for management is the mutable nature of heritage values. This
 research therefore seeks to develop an understanding of how such heritage values are
 formed, transformed and sustained over time. It takes an historical approach to
 understand the ways in which visitor knowledge of the Reef has been constructed and
 transmitted both temporally and spatially. Methods novel to heritage assessments are
 developed and implemented to identify and contrast visitor experiences in the past and
 those of the present.
 The study focuses on visitor sensory experiences of the Reef as a means to understand
 knowledge of place. A concept of sensuousness is defined and used to understand how
 knowledge of place is constructed through the human senses, and communicated within
 and between generations.
 The research identifies a number of significant changes in the way in which visitors
 have constructed and understood the Great Barrier Reef. These include the creation of
 idealised Pacific islands at the expense of an Australian location and character; the
 transformation of the dangerous underwater world into a controlled and benign coral
 garden; and the synecdoche of the coral garden as representative of the Reef as a whole.
 Central to these constructions is the way in which simulacra are used to create
 experiences that are increasingly both dislocated and disembodied. As a consequence
 visitor knowledge of the Reef has shifted from sensuous perception of the Reef as a
 place or series of places, to the construction of imaginative and photographic simulacra
 that manifest as experiences of space and non-place.
 Through the exploration of this case study, the thesis makes a contribution to both
 theoretical and methodological issues in heritage studies.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/83/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/83/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tourist encounters with other tourists</field><field name="creator">Yagi, Chiemi</field><field name="description">The focus of this thesis is the combination of two lightly examined areas, tourist-tourist encounters and nationality differences in tourist behaviour. The overall aim is to examine how tourists see other tourists and identify the differences in encounter preferences among tourist subgroups and further to analyse the factors influencing those differences.
 This thesis began with the investigation of elements related to tourist-tourist encounters through an examination of the relevant existing literature in Chapter 1. The focus was first placed on the studies of cultural contact and nationality differences. Concepts such as individualistic and collectivistic cultures, and ingroup
 and out-group evaluation were emphasized as well as the process of personto-person contact. A review of studies on visitor encounter reactions was also undertaken and key theories and concepts were outlined. This review suggested
 that both internal and external factors might influence people&#8217;s encounter reaction.
 A number of questions were raised concerning whether concepts in cultural contact and the findings of visitor encounter research in leisure studies could be applied to
 the tourism settings.
 Chapter 2 was also devoted to literature review, but the focus was shifted to the methodological issues. Studies of encounter reactions in leisure studies and
 then tourism research in general were reviewed. The framing of questions and a visual approach to measuring the encounter reaction were considered in detail.
 Also, the value of employing a multi-method approach in tourism studies was emphasized. At the end of the Chapter 2, the objectives and structure of the thesis,
 which were developed from the literature review, were stated. In an attempt to achieve the thesis objectives, several studies were carried out.
 Chapter 3 presented a study of tourist-tourist encounters as described in online travelogues by Japanese and Americans. The focus of this study was on two
 topics: tourist-tourist encounters and nationality differences in tourist behaviour.
 Analysis of 838 encounter episodes found that there were distinct differences in encounter reaction between these two nationalities. The study also identified the
 common themes of the encounter experience episodes and summarised typical models of responding to other tourists in the descriptive travelogues.
 Chapter 4 presented a study conducted online to investigate the stereotypical ideas of Japanese and American tourists. Based on a 162-person sample, the
 study compared the auto and hetero image of Japanese and Americans as tourist and the preferences for seeing them. Major study findings revealed that there were
 differences between the own nationality image (auto image) and the image reported by other nationalities (hetero image): Japanese tended to perceive Japanese tourists
 rather more negatively than non-Japanese and American tended to perceive American tourists rather more positively than non-Americans.
 Chapter 5 was devoted to an initial study using photographic simulation to examine encounter preferences. Seventy-nine Japanese participants responded to
 this web-based survey. It was found that the Japanese prefer at least a small number (and not total absence) of people and also prefer to see Caucasian-looking
 people at both reef and rainforest settings. This study also served as the basis for developing and conducting the larger scale study presented in Chapter 6.
 Chapter 6 contained the results of two studies &#8211; research using an on-site questionnaire employing the visual simulation approach with 409 participants, the
 results of which were further analysed in a follow-up study using focus groups. The results of these studies provided some valuable insights into the tourist-tourist
 encounter phenomenon. Importantly, it was found that Japanese and Westerners have different patterns of encounter preferences depending on the number and
 appearance of the other tourists: Japanese tended to prefer small or larger number of people, while Westerners were likely to prefer absence of other people; Japanese
 showed strong preference in seeing Caucasian-looking people rather than Asian-looking people whereas Westerners did not indicate any particular preferences
 regarding people&#8217;s appearance. The results contradicted the existing research in sociology and leisure studies, and can be explained by a combination of tourist
 psychology, and differences in culture and home environment of the observing tourists.
 Some insights obtained in this thesis include understanding the variation of how tourists view other tourists, and the pattern of tourist-tourist encounter preferences.
 The approach to the subject matter, using photographic images as visual simulations, proved a workable methodological style for this kind of work. Further investigation of tourist-tourist relationship, particularly interrelationships involving interactions were
 suggested, but some of the immediate value of the present work lies in endorsing the acceptability and visitor preferences for the mixing of international tourists in tourist settings.
 A version of the quantitative analysis part of the study reported in Chapter 3 of this thesis has been published in the Journal of Tourism Studies (2001; volume 12(2):
 22-31). Theme-based analysis of encounter episodes reported in Chapter 3 was published in the proceedings of the 2001 Annual Conference for the Japanese
 Institute of Tourism Research. Also, highlights of the results presented in Section 6.2 were published in the proceedings of the First Asian Pacific Forum for Graduate
 Students Research in Tourism, held in Macao in 2002.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/84/1/01front.PDF</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/84/2/02chapter1.PDF</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/84/3/03chapter2.PDF</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/84/4/04chapter3.PDF</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/84/5/05Chapter4.PDF</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/84/6/06Chapter5.PDF</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/84/7/07Chapter6.PDF</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/84/8/08Chapter7.PDF</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/84/9/09ReferenceList.PDF</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/84/10/10AppendicesA-G.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/84/11/11AppendicesH-M.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Philippines censuses of 1903 and 1939 and the representation of women's occupations</field><field name="creator">Sloane, Fiona Margaret</field><field name="description">Long-held doubts about the 1903 Philippines Census occupation statistics
 suggest that the data for women were technically defective and misrepresented their
 employment. Despite that uncertainty, interpretations of the 1939 Census tend to agree
 that a transformation of women's occupations occurred over the period. In this view,
 the data showed that women moved fiom small-scale, home-based, textile manufacture
 into agriculture and domestic service, or withdrew from the labour market.
 Revised opinions of the social construction, subjectivity and rhetoric of
 historical documents emphasise authorial power and intentions. Benedict Anderson,
 for example, proposes that the colonial census instrument created a mythical society to
 reinforce pre-conceived ideas of racial and economic superiority. Others contend that
 male concepts of identification, measurement and classification of occupations ignored
 women's economic contribution and confirmed their dependency. Recent feminist
 literature sees women not as victims, but as active agents in their own lives and
 therefore, able to influence a census.
 Having regard to this literature, this inquiry looks again at the 1903 and 1939
 Philippines Censuses and the representations of women's occupations. By
 investigating the context of the 1903 Census, it is possible to test Anderson's
 hypothesis. Findings include points of agreement about Census style and subjectivity,
 but I argue that we cannot prove colonial intentions by the Census Office or the
 Census author, or attribute the purpose to the concept of colonialism. The inquiry then
 hypothesises that misrepresentation of women's occupations in the data was a likely
 consequence of U.S. Census Bureau management of the occupation statistics, and that
 the distortion was sufficient to influence perceptions of structural change. An
 examination of the probable structures and application of the occupation criteria fails
 to remove the uncertainty about the classification of occupations in 1903, but presents
 a tentative new interpretation of the 1939 Census. Detailed examination of selected
 occupations tends to support a claim that the form of the Census accounts might have
 contributed to the view that there was structural change in women's occupations, but
 distortion of the data is unverifiable. Although my hypothesis is unproven, the inquiry
 helps clarify reasons for the uncertainty and for some contradictions in the data, and it
 shows that the data were more complex than previously considered. The distinctive
 character of the Philippines occupation data and possible connections to U.S. Census
 Bureau events suggest that we might view the 1903 and 1939 Philippines Censuses as
 experimental exercises in the evolution of occupation statistics. The Philippines
 accounts represented flawed and illogical but material steps in the development of a
 statistical recognition of women's economic contribution to society.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/86/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/86/2/02intro.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/86/3/03chapter1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/86/4/04chapter2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/86/5/05chapter3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/86/6/06chapter4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/86/7/07chapter5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/86/8/08chapter6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/86/9/09chapter7.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/86/10/10chapter8.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/86/11/11bibliography.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/86/12/12appendix_I.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/86/13/13appendix_II.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tourism education at the tertiary level in Indonesia from the perspectives of the tourism educators, government officials, industry professionals and students</field><field name="creator">Ernawati, Diyah</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates tourism education at the tertiary level in Indonesia from the perspectives
 of the stakeholders. It consists of four studies investigating current tourism curriculum, future
 master&#8217;s degree in tourism, the relationship between tourism education and the tourism industry
 and future development of Indonesian tourism education. The aims of the research are as
 follows:(1) to investigate the respondents&#8217; perspectives on the current tourism education at the
 higher education level in Indonesia; (2) to identify the experts&#8217; views on a proposed masters&#8217;
 degree curriculum for Indonesia; (3) to investigate the relationship between tourism educators
 and the tourism industry professionals; and (4) to investigate the future development of
 Indonesian tourism education. The studies involve four different stakeholders i.e. educators,
 government officials
 Chapter one of the thesis explores the background context for the study on tourism education in
 Indonesia. It examines the importance of the tourism industry to Indonesia&#8217;s economy. In
 particular it discusses characteristics of foreign and domestic tourists, and the opportunities as
 well as challenges of the industry. The chapter also explores the needs for tourism education at
 the degree level to provide the industry with more qualified employees graduating from higher
 tourism education as well as to supply qualified tourism educators and researchers for the public
 sector. The review identifies that there are issues which may affect the development of tourism
 education at the university level in Indonesia. Furthermore, the chapter examines briefly the
 stakeholder theories which exists in management studies and discusses the importance of
 investigating the perspectives of four different stakeholder groups.
 The second chapter examines critically tourism education development and reviews theoretical
 frameworks for tourism education. To identify gaps which exist within the area, a number of
 tourism and hospitality studies were reviewed. The review recognises that most studies
 conducted use quantitative approaches with few of them utilising qualitative approaches. Based
 on the gaps identified from literature reviews, particularly the methodological approaches, this
 study utilised a number of methodologies to collect data for the thesis. A qualitative semistructured
 interview combined with desk research was predominantly used for Study One and
 Two. Study Three and Four used a content analysis and a combination of open-ended and closed
 questionnaires for collecting data.
 The first study which is reported in Chapter 3 uses a combination of content analysis and semistructured
 qualitative interviews to examine the current curriculum content of tourism education. It
 assesses the approaches and evaluates curriculum relevance for professional careers. Sixty
 respondents were interviewed with each stakeholder group represented by 15 individuals. The
 analysis of the curriculum indicated that course contents generally represented a broad range of
 the core components of the body of knowledge proposed by the British-based Tourism Society.
 The findings indicated that that most respondents, particularly professionals and government,
 perceived that a professionally based curriculum focusing on hotels and restaurants was the most
 common one in Indonesia. Almost two thirds of the respondents maintained that &#8216;fulfilling the
 industry needs&#8217; and &#8216;availability of future employments&#8217; were the two significant reasons for
 offering the program. A multidisciplinary approach was found to be the most common one and it
 far outweighed a monodisciplinary approach. However, the current approach was not considered
 appropriate by fifty-six percent of the respondents. They suggested that the current curriculum
 lacked practical knowledge and was not sufficiently industry-centred.
 Chapter four focuses on the industry &#8211; education relationship. Based on the finding of study one,
 in which tourism educators and industry professionals occasionally indicated contradictory views,
 this study was aimed at identifying key issues influencing the relationship. A summary of the findings indicated that different views on approaches and inadequate support by the tourism
 industry are influential concerns. A number of proposed solutions to lessen the conflicts were
 identified. For example, both groups suggested that incorporating the cooperative education in
 employment planning and providing incentives to the students would be advantageous. However,
 educators in particular are also concerned that the involvement of the industry may influence the
 focus of the curriculum. Educators suggested that the private sector should assist in defining job
 opportunities to inform tourism education.
 The perspective of the experts on the proposed curriculum for a master&#8217;s degree in Indonesia
 was also studied. The specific aims of the study included identifying subjects deemed relevant for
 the tourism master&#8217;s degree program, investigating the area of emphases and subjects most
 required for each area of concentration. Of nineteen subjects provided to the experts, sixteen
 were considered very to moderately important. The first four subjects include Human Behaviour
 in Organisation, Information Management, Planning and Design for Tourism and Marketing in
 Tourism. The respondents strongly recommended three areas of emphases: Hotel Management,
 Tourism Planning and Development and Tourism Marketing for the near future. Among sixteen
 subjects chosen, four were common to any area of concentration. They included Communication
 Skills and Interpersonal Relations, Principles of Tourism, Tourism Forecasting and Administration
 of Travel and Tourism Services.
 Chapter six used the selected findings from Study One and Two to elaborate particular issues of
 interest such as the future development of tourism, level of responsibility of certain stakeholder
 groups and the roles of government and industry professionals. It also identified elective courses
 for four-year tourism degree programs. The study utilised survey questionnaires distributed to 353
 respondents from five provinces i.e. Jakarta, West Java, Central Java, Yogyakarta and Bali. The
 selection of the sites was based on the fact that these five provinces were well equipped with
 infrastructure and function as mature tourist destinations. Four statements which include the need
 to develop undergraduate and postgraduate degree program, education and training are needed
 to enhance the quality of employees, more industry involvement in industrial experiences and
 more qualified tourism educators were all items with a high level of consensus. The findings also
 imply that most respondents perceived full-time faculty members as the most responsible group
 in program influencing curriculum design in both undergraduate and postgraduate programs.
 Chapter seven summarised the selected results of each study, its limitations and the implications
 for future Indonesian tourism education as well as suggested research. The chapter also
 discussed the relationship between the findings of the studies with the existing literature and with
 findings of previous studies in this area. In this chapter, it is suggested that further attention
 should be paid to investigating tourism education, which includes programs on offer, curriculum
 content, and the profile and career of tourism educators.
 A number of sections of the thesis have been published in conference proceedings and refereed
 journals. An overall perspective of the studies was published in the International Journal of
 Tourism Research (Vol.30 (2), 34 &#8211; 39, 2002, whereas the third study which focused on the
 proposed of master&#8217;s degree curriculum as viewed by the experts has been published in Tourism
 Recreation Research 20(1), 89 &#8211; 95, 2001. The main findings of study one &#8211; the current tourism
 education as viewed by the stakeholders &#8211; has been presented at the First Asia Pacific
 Postgraduate Conference in Tourism, in China and published as a conference proceedings. A
 part of the findings of study one has also been published as a Research Note in Annals of
 Tourism Research 30(1), 255 &#8211; 258, 2003. The complete findings of study one have been
 accepted for the Journal of Travel and Tourism Teaching and due to be published in 2003.

Apart from exploring the impact of significant others, additional influences include Museum and Gallery collections, Library collections, and a multiplicity of literary interests which encompass the development of an early predisposition for exploring the potential of a synthesis between the spiritual and material. The thesis documents and analyses previous practice as well as the effect of a dramatic move in geographic location.
 This overview is provided as a backdrop to the current research. However the primary focus of the research derives from the possibilities inherent in a literary work and its potential for generating the conceptual underpinning and compositional framework of a visual work. Significant factors in this regard are the identification of ideas allied to various aspects of temporality and their relationship and translation from literary sources to their development and realization as visual interpretations.
 Outcomes of the research include exhibitions of artwork in Brisbane and Townsville, the realization of two Public Artworks, and the fabrication of an Artist&#8217;s Book. Issues relating to the translation of work designed for exhibition in a gallery situation and the translation of selected pieces into Public Artworks are explored. In treating the evolution of an Artist&#8217;s Book, the origins and conceptual background of the text are scrutinized in concert with the eisegetical approach adopted in terms of its visual interpretation and structural development. Although the commercial publication of the book represents a post examination outcome, the research cites earlier ideas for its replication and editioning up to that point.
 A chronologically organized, illustrated survey of exhibited works, together with a description of the images, is included. The qualitative and quantitative aspects of responses to the artist&#8217;s work are discussed from two perspectives. The first views these in terms of a body of work brought together for presentation as an exhibition and the other from the point of view of the development of works destined to be located within the public domain. Also included are the implications of this exploration for further creative practice, which are probed in relation to the development of future artistic directions.

 which one visual artist interrogates environment as artistic crucible. The concept of
 Head, Heart and Hand corrals the various domains of studio practice, the
 intellectual, perception and cognition (Head), the emotional, memory and intuition
 (Heart) and, the technical, skills, media and processes (Hand). These three domains
 form a triangulation of artistic activity to guide the researcher&#8217;s examination of
 practice.
 The journey begins with the personal dilemmas embedded in the artist&#8217;s practice.
 The genesis of ideas to creation of artworks and exhibitions, reflection on practice
 and on action expose aesthetic decision making through the voice of the artist.
 Drawing, using traditional and emerging contemporary media and processes, is the
 core fine art studio medium and practice integral to the research and the primary
 instrument of Hand.
 A theoretical framework derived from the writings of Bell (1914), Langer (1954),
 Arnheim (1974), Csikszentmihalyi (1993) and Damasio (1994,1999) provides the
 framework from which the researcher shapes the various drivers (intuition, memory
 and perception) for artistic practice. The research deals with such academically
 unfamiliar concepts of feeling and the sense of rightness so comfortably a part of
 the creative process yet generally grounded in the somewhat tacit knowledge of
 artists. An extensive survey of drawing as a core fine art practice and as a stage en route to
 other art forms or realizations maps out the various attitudes and categories of
 drawing practice that exist within the context of the Western Fine Arts tradition.
 With a particular focus on Australian artists and personal mentors, particularly those
 highly regarded for their draughtsmanship, the Australian foregrounds the
 researcher&#8217;s studio practice.
 A personal research tool termed visual autobiography is constructed from
 contemporary social science research methods used to explore culture and cultural
 production. From an artist centred model, this organic research methodology allows
 the artist/researcher to experience periods of intense studio immersion and to extract
 a meta-narrative from which patterns of behaviour become explicit and therefore
 examinable.
 A substantial autobiography maps out the life-world of the artist and explores the
 very foundations of his belief system and the elements that shape particular personal
 perceptions about art, drawing, environment and his place in the visual arts world.
 Traditional artist research tools such as visual diaries, sketching in-situ and
 photography describe the way the artist moves through sometimes-exotic far-away
 environments to find inspiration for future artworks.
 From the written autobiography, three pivotal environments emerge to become the
 fertile ground from which individual episodes of artistic production emerge. Paris
 and Provence, France, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada and Cairns, Far North
 Queensland, Australia develop into the significant sites for stage one of the research. The outcomes of these investigations culminate in a solo exhibition
 comprising an installation of thirty-six drawings.
 Using the visual autobiographical tool as a mode of reflection on the content and
 process of work in the exhibition, it became clear that the circle had not yet been
 completed. As a result of this reflexive process a further body of drawings was
 created to test the theories and models generated during the initial phase of the
 research. This final body of drawings explore the morphing of memories with the
 factual observation of place thus exposing the insider&#8217;s view of the city of Sydney,
 Australia.
 At the end of the journey the artist/researcher pauses to reflect and look back at the

 production of ammonium phosphate fertilizer in late 1999. In the production process,
 Cambrian marine phosphorites are crushed and dissolved (acidulated) in sulphuric and
 phosphoric acid to produce stronger phosphoric acid and, as a by-product,
 phosphogypsum (PG). The phosphoric acid is used, with ammonia, for fertilizer
 production while the PG is permanently stored on-site in gypsum stacking facilities.
 In common with other fertilizer plants, the volume of PG in storage at Phosphate Hill
 has increased rapidly. Eventually tens of millions of tonnes of the material will need to
 be maintained in permanent facilities. Above-ground stacks, such as those currently
 used, will be subject to erosion, potentially forming sources of pollutants for the
 surrounding pastoral country. An alternative option is to store the PG in the voids left
 after mining of the phosphorite ore body. This would immediately negate most
 opportunities for erosion of, and contamination from, the storage facilities. This study
 was instigated to assess the likely impact of in-pit disposal.
 Very little work had been done on characterizing the PG produced at Phosphate Hill. A
 single initial set of analyses taken from samples obtained during the commissioning
 period identified the major components and subjected the material to rigorous
 mechanical testing. By contrast, this study has focussed on fully identifying the
 mineralogy, chemistry, radiochemistry and physical characteristics of the PG in its two
 main species: the hemihydrate (bassanite - CaSO4.0.5H2O) as it is produced from the
 phosphoric acid plant and the dihydrate (gypsum - CaSO4.2H2O) that is transported
 from the re-slurry tank into the gypsum stack for storage. In addition, the liquid
 component of the PG slurry, derived from acid process water that is recirculated
 through the stacking system, has also been analysed.
 The results show that the four species of calcium sulphate can be found in the PG.
 Bassanite (CaSO4.0.5H2O) is dominant in the hemihydrate filter cake but also remains
 in the stack material. Dihydrate gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O), including species with extra H2O molecules (identified as *.0.5H2O), dominates the stack gypsum but also occurs at
 low levels in the hemihydrate filter cake. Anhydrite (CaSO4) is also found at low levels
 within samples from both areas.
 Quartz (SiO 2) is the other dominant mineral in the PG assemblage. This is at significant
 levels (&gt;20%) and causes the PG to be notably different to that produced elsewhere in
 the world, where quartz makes up &lt;1% of the total. The high volumes of this mineral
 result from the make-up of the parent phosphorite ore body, which has a comparatively
 high level of chert and silicified siltstone and shale.
 P2O5 levels are elevated and relate primarily to the presence of co-precipitated and reprecipitated
 phosphates and remnant phosphoric acid with very minor amounts of
 unreacted phosphorite and phosphatised chert and siltstone. Mica (paragonite
 [NaAl2(Si3Al)O10(OH)2] and probably muscovite [K2Al4[Si6Al2O20](OH,F)4] and glauconite
 [(K,Ca,Na)~1.6(Fe3+,Al,Mg,Fe2+)4.0Si7.3Al0.7O20(OH)4] sourced from the ore body) was a
 consistent presence at low levels in the PG mix. An unidentified amphibole was also
 found, although some doubts exist as to the accuracy of the XRD technique to
 adequately identify such minerals at the low levels seen here. If correct, the latter is
 probably from the hornblende group (magnesiohastingsite to hastingsite) that occurs in
 the basement Kalkadoon Granodiorite, or from the basement Proterozoic metasediments
 of the Plum Mountain Gneiss and Corella Formation. Various clays, most commonly
 smectite ((&#189;Ca,Na)0.7(Al,Mg,Fe)4[(Si,Al)8O20](OH)4.nH2O) and clinoptilolite
 ((Na,K)6[Al6Si30O72].24H2O) were also consistently present.
 Major element analyses are consistent with the mineralogical interpretation. Elements,
 apart from Ca, S and Si and including F, were at levels similar to those found in PG
 manufactured at other sites around the globe. Trace elements showed elevated levels of
 Ba, Mn and Pb relative to foreign-sourced PG. This appears to reflect the primary and
 secondary (weathering products) mineralogy of the ore body.
 Crystal morphology was also shown to be similar to that produced abroad, at sites as
 diverse as the USA, north Africa and the Middle East. The gypsum component of the
 Phosphate Hill PG appears to contains fewer acicular crystals and no swallow-tail twins
 were observed, unlike at other sites. Massive clusters are common. Radiochemical analyses have identified U-238, Po-210, Pb-210, Ra-226 and Rn-222 as
 being present in the ore and throughout the manufacturing process. All are present to
 varying degrees in the PG but the U-238 tends to partition more into the fertilizer. None
 of the radionuclides occur at levels that could be considered a risk. However, the study
 has identified that recirculation of the fluids through the re-slurry-stacking circuit is
 concentrating the radionuclides occurring in the process water. This issue will need to
 be monitored and addressed by the Company in future.
 The second part of the project has been to study the effects of dissolution on the PG if
 placed into surface mining voids as backfill. At Phosphate Hill, potential dissolution of
 mine backfill material can be derived from two sources. The first is the monsoonal "wet season" over summer, where individual rain events can result in over 150mm of
 rain falling in the space of a few hours, leading to flash flooding and inundation of wide
 areas around the local watercourses. This has the potential to result in the temporary
 submergence of any of the backfilled areas located within the flood plain. The second
 source is from interaction of the PG with the groundwater. The latter will occur
 because the Beetle Creek Formation, which hosts the ore body, also contains the local
 aquifer and post-mining recharge will see the SWL return to pre-mining levels, well
 above the floors of the pits.
 Dissolution experiments were performed using hemihydrate and two forms of dihydrate
 PG, simulating approximately two years&#8217; annual rainfall/intermittent full inundation of a
 PG backfill pile by either groundwater or floodwater. The dihydrate PG was newly deposited
 material that still contained high levels of fluid and "aged" dihydrate that had
 been on the stack for 4-6 months and was dry. Analyses of the dissolution and the pre and
 post-dissolution PG showed that highly contaminated dissolution would occur in
 the first 2-3 flushing events and that levels of contaminants fall rapidly with further
 flushing. The major long-term contaminant has been identified as sulphates and acid
 derived from gypsum dissolution. Ca and total P are also significant. Radionuclide
 analysis of leachate could not be undertaken in this study but should be considered for
 any future studies, if the Company plans to utilise in-pit disposal of PG. Gypsum dissolution is also likely to be a long-term problem in that the aquifer is
 essentially a closed system. This, along with the dominant flow direction, will result in
 concentration of any contaminants in the southern part of the aquifer. Basic simple
 modelling of the effects of a sulphate-rich solution mixing with the groundwater at its
 current quality suggests that the sulphate may reach levels of concern for human
 consumption (i.e. &gt;500mg/l) with an input of contaminated fluid the equivalent of
 &lt;25% of the total volume of the aquifer. As the site is covered by active pastoral leases
 the effect of sulphate contamination of groundwater on cattle was also considered. In
 this environment problems occur at sulphate levels of ~1000mg/l which the modelling
 suggests would not occur until a mix of 50% leachate to 50% groundwater was
 achieved. Although this appears to be a remote possibility for contamination of the
 whole aquifer, the very high transmissivity of the aquifer will result in a polluted plume
 being drawn directly into wells that are pumping, which could easily result in the
 ingestion of poor quality water by cattle drinking from troughs supplied by any such
 bore. Acidification of the groundwater could also possibly occur with the escape of
 acid leachate into the aquifer, with the pH of the water rapidly falling below the
 preferred minimum of pH 6 at relatively low levels of mixing (10% leachate to 90%
 groundwater). Acidification to this extent can cause acidosis in cattle, a condition that
 is potentially fatal.
 Phosphorous is also present in high levels in the PG leachate. There is potential for this
 to lead to outbreaks of toxic cyanobacteria in water storage tanks and troughs in the
 warmer months, which can result in fatalities in cattle through liver or respiratory
 failure. However, this potential may be buffered by the likely acidity of any high-P
 leachate, as cyanobacteria prefers neutral to alkaline water conditions.
 Although contaminated leachate can be largely contained by use of liners and capping
 material, the use of PG as backfill at Phosphate Hill faces challenges that would be
 extremely difficult to overcome. The mining method leaves walls that are sub-vertical
 (&gt;70&#186;) and exposes the full ore seam on the down-dip side of the ore body. Pit floors
 have a dome-and-basin morphology. Although the latter could be flattened and lined,
 the steep walls, with their exposures of abrasive, sharp-edged phosphorite would
 preclude the use of most lining materials. The scale of earth- moving and lining required
 would also be cost-prohibitive. The type of PG used for backfilling operations and the method of delivery also create
 difficulties. Filter cake hemihydrate PG would require a very large truck fleet and/or
 the construction of a new overland conveyor. Once deposited, the material&#8217;s tendency
 to form large, loose clumps would allow rapid through- flow of fluids. PG slurry could
 be piped directly to its deposition point, requiring the construction of an extensive pipe
 network, but is otherwise completely unsuitable for the task due to the liquid
 component. Dry dihydrate PG is the best material for backfill. However, it would also
 require a very large truck fleet and the act of rehandling the material from stack to pit
 would create dust problems for the term of the rehandling exercise. After deposition the
 leachate problem would still exist, albeit produced at a slower rate due to the
 dihydrate&#8217;s lower permeability. The leachate problem could be countered by using a
 layer-cake style of construction where calcareous rocks are interlayered with PG to
 neutralise any fluids derived from the PG. Despite this, other engineering and
 environmental issues probably preclude the use of even this method of backfill.
 This study has produced the base-line information required for any future work
 involving the PG, such as the recommendation for trials of in-pit dumping to go ahead,
 observing a range of conditions. As a result, it is recommended that WMCF only use
 dihydrate PG as backfill in areas that are well above the natural standing water level and
 that have been adequately lined. The majority of PG will still need to be stored in lined
 and capped stacks, as are currently used. It is also recommended that the radionuclide
 content of the recycled stack fluids being regularly monitored and plans drawn up to
 deal with the contaminated fluids if it proves necessary. Future research should also be
 conducted on radionuclide transport and behaviour in PG leachate.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/103/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/103/2/02chapter1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/103/3/03chapter2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/103/4/04chapter3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/103/5/05chapter4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/103/6/06chapter5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/103/7/07chapter6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/103/8/08bibliography.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/103/9/09appendix1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/103/10/10appendix2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/103/11/11appendices3-6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/103/12/12appendix7.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/103/13/13appendices8-11.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The incidence of plant-parasitic nematodes on sugarcane in Queensland, and studies on pathogenicity and associated crop losses, with particular emphasis on lesion nematode (Pratylenchus Zeae</field><field name="creator">Blair, Brenden Leslie</field><field name="description">In Queensland, sugarcane has been cropped as a monoculture for 80 years or more in most districts. In the last 30 years, plough-out and replant (no fallow) has increased,
 as has reliance upon inorganic fertilisers, and intensive tillage to remove soil compaction. An associated decline in the productive capacity of the soil to grow sugarcane has been identified, and has been termed &#8216;yield decline&#8217; (YD). Root health and sugarcane yields are increased after fallowing, crop rotation, and soil fumigants
 (Magarey and Croft 1995; Garside et al. 2001; Meyer and Van Antwerpen 2001), implicating root pathogens in YD. However, in the past, nematode studies have been confined to testing the economics of using nematicides.
 It was the objective of this work to explore the association between plant-parasitic nematodes and sugarcane in Queensland. Firstly, this thesis examines the incidence
 of nematodes on field crops. The regional distribution of nematodes is reported, together with nematode populations and dynamics relating to (a) root habit, (b) root
 distribution across the row to inter-row profile, and (c) temporal changes during the crop cycle.
 Secondly, this thesis explores the parasitism of Queensland sugarcane by nematodes, and role in YD. The importance of sett roots, nematodes, and general YD biota on
 early plant establishment from 0-100 days after planting is examined in field miniplots. Crop losses due to nematodes are assessed at 16 field sites using nonvolatile
 nematicides, and the pathogenicity of Pratylenchus zeae is examined in glasshouse pots and field miniplots.
 The lesion nematode (P. zeae) was found to be ubiquitous in sugarcane fields, and usually at higher densities than other species. The density of root-knot nematode
 (Meloidogyne spp.) was also high in sandy soils (&lt;20% clay), but a high proportion of other soils also contained this nematode, albeit at lower densities. The
 ectoparasites, spiral nematode (Helicotylenchus dihystera), stubby-root nematode (Paratrichodorus minor) and stunt nematode (Tylenchorhynchus annulatus) were
 also detected in a high number of fields (&gt;66%). Historically, the sugar industry has perceived nematode problems to be confined to very sandy soils in south Queensland. However, plant-parasitic nematodes occur in all soils, suggesting a more widespread role in YD.
 Within sugarcane fields, nematodes were distributed in aggregated patterns. Thus, densities of lesion nematode varied up to five-fold across short distances (1.4 m)
 even at a constant distance (20 cm) from the sugarcane stool. Ring and spiral nematode were more aggregated than lesion nematode, perhaps due to more
 sedentary feeding habits and greater sensitivity to edaphic gradients (eg. soil texture and moisture) across the field at the macro-distributional level. The &#8216;negative
 binomial model&#8217; was used to predict the sampling effort required to estimate mean nematode densities with degrees of precision. Mean nematode densities across the row, near row (20-30 cm from the stool), and inter-row were very similar during the crop cycle. Because high densities of
 nematodes were regularly recovered from &#8216;near the row&#8217; this zone was recommended for standard sampling. During the crop cycle, nematode densities were related to the
 volume of the root system and its growth rate, as influenced by season. Because sugarcane develops a new root system annually, nematode densities increased and then declined each year. At planting, up to 400 lesion nematodes and up to 100 spiral nematodes/200 mL of soil were present, which was usually more than other pest species (&lt;50 nematodes/200 mL of soil). Lesion nematode generally persisted at
 higher densities than other pest species during the crop cycle.
 Lesion nematode was pathogenic to sugarcane in 1.5 L pots, reducing root weight and sometimes reducing shoot biomass. In 50 L pots, this nematode caused a general blackening of roots and reduced fine root length by over 50%. Shoot biomass was generally not reduced, suggesting that YD is induced by a combination of root pathogens.
 At planting, prior studies have related poor primary tiller emergence to poor sett root growth in field soil (Cadet and Spaull 1985; Garside et al. 2002 a; Pankhurst et al.
 2002). However, this study showed that buds can rely entirely upon the stem cutting to shoot and become established primary tillers. It was concluded that damaged buds, dormant buds, a poorly nurtured seed source, and poor sett root growth, all contribute to poor primary tiller establishment. Deleterious soil biota and nematodes also
 reduced the health and volume of shoot roots, which reduced the number of secondary tillers emerging at early establishment. While the experimental sites had a
 history of consistent fumigation responses (&gt;80%), nematicide responses were quite variable (0-50%). Experiments in glasshouse pots confirmed that nematodes
 contribute in part to fumigation responses in YD soils.
 To assess crop losses, nematodes were controlled for the entire crop cycle using nonvolatile nematicides at 16 field sites. Fertile sandy loam to clay soils were chosen
 where losses from nematodes have only been speculated on previously. While poor tillering due to serious nematodes problems is well documented in sandy soils (&lt;10%
 clay) in Queensland and around the world (Bull 1981; Spaull and Cadet 1990), stalk numbers were increased with nematicides only at some of the sites reported in this
 thesis. This contrast was attributed to the relatively low populations of root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) at planting, and higher soil fertility. However, stalk
 length was significantly increased in nematicide-treated plots at most sites. Thus, responses in harvest yield of 0-20 T/ha were usually observed in both plant and
 ratoon crops. Untreated crop yields were average for the surrounding districts, as were nematode densities, suggesting the responses were robust across regions. Upon
 extrapolation, lost productivity from nematodes is estimated at over A$ 100 million annually. These results indicate that nematodes are a subtle but important pest, and
 contribute to YD on the sandy loam to clay soils on which 95% of Australia&#8217;s sugarcane is grown.
 The environment and/or level of crop management influenced yield losses from nematodes, and nematicides responses were related to the control of a number of species, especially in ratoons. However, lesion nematode was correlated most
 consistently with reduced sugarcane yield. It was concluded that lesion nematode is the most important nematode pest of sugarcane in Queensland, and contributes to YD
 by reducing the health of primary and secondary roots, and by decreasing the length and number of fine roots.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/142/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/142/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reduction of post-surgical adhesions using a pig model</field><field name="creator">Alizzi, A.</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to reduce pericardial adhesions after open-heart surgery thus enabling re-sternotomies to be much safer and less time consuming for the surgical team. A pig model was developed to test the effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and a barrier method in reducing post-surgical pericardial adhesions. Four groups (11 per group) of pigs 8-12 weeks of age were used. Group one was the control group, Group two received indomethacin, Group three received rofecoxib (also a NSAID) and a polyethyleneglycol (Co-Seal) was applied to the pericardium as a barrier in Group four.
 After performing a median sternotomy, an adhesion induction model was applied to maximize inflammation in the pericardium. This included abrasion of the heart surface, leaving blood in the pericardium and drying of tissues. The chest was then closed. In Group four, Co-Seal was sprayed on the heart before closure. Post-operatively, Groups two and three received indomethacin and rofecoxib respectively for five days. Plasma markers of inflammation were assessed on days 2, 5 and 10 post-operative. In each group, eight animals were re-opened after 12 weeks and three after 25 weeks to assess adhesions according to adhesion assessment scales. Tissue samples were collected for histopathological examination looking mainly at epicardial and adhesive tissue thickness.
 It was observed in this study that adhesions were changed from dense to thin and more easily separable, requiring more blunt rather than sharp dissection. This was seen mainly in Group two, followed by Group four. In Group three, the changes were less in terms of amount of adhesions and tenacity change as compared to the changes in Groups two and four. Comparison was with Group one, which had the densest adhesions.
 Adhesive tissue and epicardial thickness was measured. Epicardium was thinnest in Group two. Post-operative inflammatory markers, specifically PGE2 and TXB2 were inhibited mainly in Group two. Less inhibition of these markers was seen in Group three and nearly no inhibition was seen in Groups one and four. The more general
 vii
 markers used (WCC, ESR and CRP) did not fully show the expected changes in the four groups. The adhesion induction model formulated in this study was successful and may be used in similar future projects.
 In conclusion, this model, applied clinically, will reduce adhesions in the pericardium and retrosternal areas after surgery, rendering re-openings safer and less time consuming. Indomethacin has proven to be the best choice to achieve this following a relatively easy and short protocol of administration. The idea of giving patients indomethacin for five days only to achieve significant reduction in adhesion formation after surgery would be attractive to many surgical groups around the world as the short period of administration would minimize any side effects associated with this drug.
 Significant reduction in adhesions was also seen following the application of Co-Seal. The attraction here would be the ease of use and the non-pharmacological effects of this barrier method. Rofecoxib was not as effective as indomethacin and Co-seal in adhesion reduction. Future studies in this pig model should examine the extent of adhesion formation following the combined use of indomethacin and Co-Seal.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/146/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/146/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Struvite crystallization from nutrient rich wastewater</field><field name="creator">Ali, Md. Imtiaj</field><field name="description">Discharge of untreated nutrient-rich wastewater is a problematic issue, which may
 cause root burning and eutrophication of receiving water. It is also a problematic issue
 due to the formation of crystalline deposits in waste water systems. The recovery of
 nutrients using a crystallization technique may provide a value added product. The
 recovered product is struvite, which is chemically known as magnesium ammonium
 phosphate hexahydrate. The key focus of this research is the modeling and simulation
 of struvite growth, which incorporates solution chemistry and thermodynamics, kinetics
 of growth and process description of the recovery system. This research also focuses on
 the strategy of struvite crystallization in a fed batch system, to avoid spontaneous
 precipitation. A fully integrated control strategy in pilot scale is developed in this
 research. This control strategy is based on feedback control, maintaining constant
 supersaturation throughout the crystallization. The development and commissioning of
 experiments includes investigation of suitable seeds, automatic temperature control,
 operating zone of crystallization and correct design of the pilot scale reactor.
 Experimental investigation showed a precise stability of the controlled supersaturation.
 Moreover, size independent growth is indicated in this investigation. An ensemble of
 experimental data is combined with a dynamic model to carry out parameter estimation
 of struvite growth kinetic parameters using gPROMS.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/148/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/148/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influences of benthic algae on coral settlement and post-settlement survival: implications for the recovery of disturbed and degraded reefs</field><field name="creator">Birrell, Chico Liam</field><field name="description">Benthic algae generally dominate degraded and disturbed coral reefs, however our understanding of how algae influence coral recruitment, a critical process for the recovery of these reefs, is limited. Surveys to compare benthic biota close to versus distant from coral recruits on inshore reefs of the Great Barrier Reef identified several key groups of algae that are frequently associated with, and thus potentially favour coral recruitment. In particular, filamentous algal turfs dominated the substrata surrounding coral recruits and crustose coralline algae and the brown alga Lobophora variegata were also abundant and therefore may promote coral recruitment. In contrast, soft corals and even hard corals were less frequently found adjacent to coral recruits, suggesting that they are likely to have negative impacts on coral recruitment.
 Subsequently, I experimentally investigated the effects of two filamentous algal turfs established on dead coral surfaces, and sediments, which are often trapped by algal turfs, on settlement of the coral Acropora millepora. Adding sediment reduced settlement but the effects of different algal turfs varied, a newly established (&lt;6 week old) and relatively ungrazed turf reducing settlement, and a well established turf (up to 2.5 years) and grazed turf only reducing settlement when combined with sediments. This suggests that algal turfs can delay the recovery of coral populations on disturbed reefs, in particular in high sediment environments and with low grazing regimes.
 Next, I investigated the potential for water-borne chemical influences from benthic algae to affect coral settlement, comparing settlement in seawater influenced by an alga identified as likely to promote and others identified as likely to hinder coral recruitment in surveys of coral recruit-algae associations. The fleshy alga Lobophora variegata
 enhanced coral settlement, whereas the green filamentous alga Chlorodesmis fastigiata (Turtle weed) delayed coral settlement, and another brown alga Padina sp. (Funnel weed) apparently had no effect on coral settlement. Furthermore, these waterborne chemical influences were demonstrated to affect settlement of the coral Acropora millepora on the crustose coralline alga Hydrolithon reinboldii, which is known to induce the settlement of several Acropora spp. corals. The demonstration of waterborne effects suggests that some benthic algae can influence coral settlement before coral larvae reach the reef substrata and even where the immediate settlement location is free of algal cover.
 Finally, I investigated early survival and growth up to four months after settlement of Acropora millepora recruits in reef environments dominated by fleshy algae (Sargassum spp. and Padina spp.), which had developed from algal turf assemblages solely as a result of reduced grazing. Surprisingly, I found recruits survived and grew more in reef environments dominated by the fleshy algae at a time when seawater temperatures were abnormally high, thus contradicting the paradigm that fleshy algae generally hinder coral recruitment.
 My research suggests that, at least on inshore reefs of the Great Barrier Reef, corals may have no alternative but to recruit in habitats dominated by algae. Furthermore, the outcome of algal influence on coral recruitment, and consequently reef recovery from disturbance, may differ as a result of environmental stresses (sedimentation, elevated seawater temperatures), and the specific algae and coral life-stage (e.g. settlement, early survival) involved in coral-algal interactions.

 of copper toxicity in marine microalgae.</field><field name="creator">Blanchette, Melanie Lise</field><field name="description">Copper is necessary for normal cellular activity, but may become toxic at
 high levels. Copper is widely used in North Queensland as a component of
 agricultural chemicals and antifouling paints, and high levels of Cu have been
 measured in some near-shore marine environments. Because of this, there is a
 need to develop early warning systems of Cu pollution in marine microalgae.
 Fluorescein diacetate (FDA) is commonly used as a substrate in esterase
 activity assays as a measure of cellular activity. Intracellular cleavage of FDA by
 esterases results in free fluorescein, which can be quantified fluorometrically as
 a sublethal endpoint. The purpose of this research was to: 1) determine the
 effects of experimental design on esterase activity in Tetraselmis sp.
 (Chlorophyta) and Chaetoceros gracilis (Heterokontophyta), 2) evaluate the use
 of esterase activity as a bioassay endpoint for Cu toxicity in Symbiodinium
 microadriaticum (Dinophyta), and 3) evaluate the effects of pH, salinity, and
 temperature on esterase activity in Tetraselmis sp. employing two different
 experimental designs. Time was also devoted to standardisation of methods
 due to the lack of standardised protocols in the literature.
 The effect of experimental design on esterase activity (fluorescence) in
 Tetraselmis sp. and C. gracilis was determined by two different protocols. In the
 first protocol, microalgae were incubated with Cu in culture flasks, followed by
 sample transfer and FDA-incubation in microtitre plates for analysis. The
 second protocol exposed microalgae directly to copper in microtitre plates, and
 Cu toxicity on esterase activity (percent inhibition of fluorescence) was
 quantified without sample transfer. The flask protocol showed high withinculture
 variability and was laborious, whereas the microtitre plate protocol
 displayed a significant and replicable effect of Cu on percent inhibition of
 fluorescence. The difference between the protocols is not due to binding of Cu
 ions to the Erlenmeyer flasks: analysis of bioavailable Cu by inductively coupled
 plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) proved that there was no Cu
 binding of any nominal Cu concentrations over time. Therefore, differences are
 likely due to stagnation of esterase activity upon transfer from the flasks to the
 microtitre plates or differential adhesion of the organisms to the glassware,
 despite methodological uniformity.
 Working with established cultures of zooxanthellae (Symbiodinium
 microadriaticum) is extremely challenging, and due to its strong adhesive
 properties, standardisation of initial inoculation density (a necessity in
 microalgal bioassays) is highly difficult. Adding to the challenge is a lack of
 published literature using established cultures of zooxanthellae, and the
 tendency of the authors to &#8220;pool&#65533;? their data, burying the independent culturespecific
 dose-response relationships within large standard errors. The aim of
 this research section was to: quantify S. microadriaticum culture density using
 protein content and chlorophyll a autofluorescence as proxies, and direct cell
 count. The usefulness of these estimations in standardising initial inoculation
 density was evaluated in independent experiments using esterase activity and
 Cu toxicity on esterase activity in the previously standardised microtitre plate
 bioassay. The results of the bioassays showed irreproducible Cu doseresponse
 curves and base esterase activities between independent cultures of
 S. microadriaticum, indicating that all three procedures for estimating culture
 density were unsuitable for standardising initial inoculation density. However,
 this research illustrated the effect of culture and data pooling on bioassay
 outcome, and recommended data handling protocols for future ecotoxicological
 research.
 The third aim of this research was to quantify the effects of pH, salinity,
 and temperature on esterase activity and Cu toxicity in Tetraselmis sp. within
 the context of two different protocols: one that examined the effects of pH,
 salinity, and temperature within three independent cultures (WIC), and another
 that examined the effects of these parameters between 15 independent cultures
 (BIC) using the microtitre plate protocol. It is necessary to determine the effect
 of pH and salinity on metal toxicity because these parameters can affect metal
 speciation, which may alter overall toxicity. Temperature can influence cellular
 membrane permeability, which in turn may also affect toxicity. In general, pH
 and temperature had a significant effect on both esterase activity and Cu
 toxicity in both protocols, and salinity generally did not affect fluorescence or Cu
 toxicity. The effect of culture did not have a consistently significant effect on
 either fluorescence or Cu toxicity for all three environmental parameters in the
 WIC protocol. This research demonstrated that the microtitre plate bioassay for
 Cu toxicity should be performed at stable pH and temperature levels. It also
 revealed that Tetraselmis sp. may be a suitable candidate for bioremediation of
 copper in marine and estuarine waters, due to its stable esterase activity at high
 levels of Cu (1.0mg Cu L-1), and in changing pH, salinity, and temperature
 regimes.
 In conclusion, experimental design significantly impacted esterase
 activity in Tetraselmis sp. and C. gracilis. The microtitre plate protocol is a rapid,
 cost-effective method to determine Cu toxicity on esterase activity in
 microalgae. However, some organisms (such as S. microadriaticum) are
 unsuitable for use in this bioassay due to their unique physical properties. The
 microtitre plate protocol is a useful tool to determine the effects of pH, salinity,
 and temperature on esterase activity and Cu toxicity in Tetraselmis sp. The
 ability of this organism to tolerate high levels of Cu and changing environmental
 parameters suggests that it may be a candidate for Cu bioremediation of marine
 and estuarine waters.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/150/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/150/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology and microbiology of black band disease and brown band syndrome on the Great Barrier Reef</field><field name="creator">Boyett, Holly Virginia</field><field name="description">The overall objective of this study was to investigate the progression and transmission of black band disease (BBD) and brown band syndrome (BrB) on the Great Barrier Reef. Specifically, my aims were to: 1) examine variations in the natural progression and transmission of BBD and BrB between different months of the year and reef sites (Chapter 2); 2) investigate the effect of elevated temperature on the progression of BBD and BrB using experimental aquarium manipulations (Chapter 3); 3) histologically examine the microorganisms associated with BBD (Chapter 4); and 4) investigate the microorganisms associated with BrB using microbiological and molecular techniques (Chapter 5).
 The in situ rate of progression and transmission of black band disease (BBD) on the coral Acropora muricata was measured and compared between seasonal field studies at Lizard Island on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). BBD progressed along and transmitted between coral branches at a significantly faster rate during the austral summer month of January as opposed to the cooler months of July and May. The 2-3&#176;C increase in seawater temperatures and 650 &#956;E/m2/s rise in light intensities measured between the months of January and July/May suggest that elevated temperatures and light intensities are positively correlated to the progression and transmission of BBD. Temperature manipulations within closed experimental tanks were also performed to determine the effect of elevated temperatures on the rate of BBD progression. Increased rates of BBD progression within the higher temperature treatment (32&#176;C) during summer clearly indicate that elevated temperatures near the upper thermal limits of corals promote the progression of BBD, possibly due to a combination of increased virulence of the pathogen and increased host susceptibility at these higher temperatures. However, the lack of increased progression within elevated temperature treatments (29&#176;C and 31&#176;C) during May trials, raise the question concerning other factors that may also be required to promote the progression of BBD.
 The in situ rate of spread of brown band syndrome (BrB) on Acropora muricata branches was compared between two reefs in the northern and central sectors of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). The rate of spread of the syndrome was 2.3 times faster on a lagoon reef at Lizard Island (Horseshoe Reef) than on the reef flat at Davies Reef. Although a combination of parameters is most likely responsible for this variation, the most obvious difference between the two reef sites was the degree of water circulation. Experimentally elevated temperatures in aquarium experiments did not influence the progression of BrB at Lizard Island suggesting that temperature on its own does not enhance the progression of this syndrome. Future research should experimentally investigate whether or not the combination of elevated temperatures and high light intensities, commonly associated with summer months, enhance the progression of this syndrome.
 The microbial consortium of BBD isolated from Acropora elseyi, A. florida, A. muricata, A. nasuta, Pocillopora verrucosa, and Porites spp. at Lizard Island consisted of five different taxa of cyanobacteria. Based on morphological characteristics, two of these cyanobacteria taxa appear to belong to the genus Oscillatoria, two may be in the Order Nostocales, and one of these taxa resembles the morphological features of Phormidium corallyticum. However, these predictions are based solely on histological features and further molecular identifications are required before these species can be formally classified. Morphological and molecular studies indicated that the microorganisms associated with BrB on five acroporid colonies from Davis Reef consisted of a newly identified ciliate species and an array of associated bacteria. Analysis of 18S rDNA sequence data confirmed the ciliate as a new species belonging to the Class Oligohymenophora, Subclass Scuticociliatia. Isolation of BrB bacterial species detected a potentially pathogenic strain (HB-8) which was closely affiliated by 16S rDNA comparisons with Vibrio fortis strains. Six out of 12 acroporid branches inoculated with this potentially pathogenic strain reached 100% mortality after 48 hours, however the macroscopic signs (brown band) of the syndrome were not observed. This indicates that there are likely two phases of BrB including a tissue necrosis phase, which may be caused by the bacterium strain HB-8, and a ciliate phase which causes the characteristic brown band of the syndrome.
 In summary, the rate of progression and spread of BBD and BrB on the Great Barrier Reef appear to be dependent on the response of both the coral host and the disease pathogen to changing environmental conditions. The higher in situ rates of BBD progression and transmission during the summer month of January and the higher rates of BBD progression within temperature treatments experimentally elevated to near the upper thermal limits of corals likely reflect that environmental conditions detrimental to the coral host may simultaneously increase the virulence of the coral pathogen while reducing the coral&#8217;s immunity. However, it is important to note that the mechanisms causing mortality (i.e. ingestion of tissue versus tissue necrosis) may also have an influence on disease progression. Consequently, in order to fully understand the mechanisms and parameters involved in the progression and transmission of coral diseases, coral disease research should continue to investigate these diseases using an ecological and microbiological approach.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/151/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/151/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of fire regime on tropical savannas of north-eastern Australia: interpreting floristic patterns through critical life events</field><field name="creator">Williams, P.R.</field><field name="description">The degree to which fire influences plant species composition and abundance (referred to in this thesis as floristic patterns) in Australian tropical savannas has been the subject of debate. Available information emphasises floristic patterns rather than the mechanisms that determine patterns. The assessment of critical events in a plant&#8217;s life cycle (referred to in this thesis as critical life events) is necessary to understand population dynamics and therefore the processes that determine floristic patterns. Fire may affect population size through its influence on one or more critical life events including seed dormancy release, seed bank dynamics, seedling emergence, seedling survival and the survival and growth of juvenile and mature plants. 
 
 This thesis presents data on floristic patterns in response to fire regimes in savannas of north-eastern Australia, a region with limited quantitative information on fire response at a community level; and contributes to the broader understanding of savanna function, through an examination of life cycle processes. The aims of the research were to examine the effect of fire regime on: 
 
 a)	floristic patterns in eucalypt savannas in the vicinity of Townsville, north-eastern Australia; and 
 b)	critical life events, to investigate mechanisms determining floristic patterns. 
 
 To achieve these objectives, laboratory and shadehouse experiments were carried out and surveys of seedling emergence and vegetative post-fire regeneration were undertaken at four sites in the Townsville region. At one of these sites, Cape Cleveland, floristic patterns and critical life events were studied in detail using a manipulative fire experiment which examined three fire regimes between 1997 and 2001: 
 
 1.	Control: savanna burnt in the mid dry season (July) 1997 only.
 2.	Early burnt: savanna burnt in the mid dry season 1997 and early dry season (May) 1999.
 3.	Late burnt: savanna burnt in the mid dry season 1997 and late dry season (Oct) 1999.
 Five annual surveys of permanent plots at Cape Cleveland demonstrated a high degree of stability in species composition, however the abundance of several species was affected by fire regime. A significant increase in the abundance of various subshrubs, ephemeral and twining perennial forbs, and grasses was detected in the first year after fire, particularly following late dry season burning. The abundance of these species declined towards pre-fire levels in the second year after fire. The dominant grass Heteropogon triticeus significantly declined in abundance, and tree density increased, with fire intervals of four years. 
 
 Investigations of critical life events detected mechanisms that determine floristic patterns. A pulse of seedling emergence of subshrubs and herbaceous species occurred in the post-fire wet season, with greatest seedling density following late dry season fires. This pulse of seedling emergence explained the increase in plant abundance documented in the year following fire. It resulted from seed dormancy release, triggered by multiple fire-related agents, including the removal of herbaceous cover, which increased germination of a range of species; and the exposure to: heat-shock, which increased the germination of a range of forbs; smoke, which promoted the germination of upright perennial forbs and grasses; and nitrate, which interacted with heat shock to increase germination of at least two forbs. 
 
 The germinable soil seed bank was dominated by grasses and forbs, and seed banks of trees and shrubs were scarce and short-lived. Seasonal fluctuations were evident in the seed bank, which increased through the dry season to a maximum density in the late dry season, and declined to a minimum by the mid wet season. The high intensity late dry season fires reduced seed production by the dominant tree Corymbia clarksoniana in the year following burning, however the effect of fire on soil seed bank dynamics was limited due to the annual wet season decline in seed reserves that occurred irrespective of fire. These data indicate that late dry season fires promoted the emergence of a greater density of herb seedlings, compared with early dry season fires, by stimulating seed dormancy release in a higher proportion of seeds, and because more soil seed reserves were available in the late dry season to be affected by fire. 
 
 Seedling survival of herbaceous species was higher for those that emerged from recently burnt rather than unburnt savanna. High rates of seedling mortality of perennial species, and the short lifespan of ephemeral forbs, explained the decline in plant abundance documented in the second year following fire. A moderate proportion of seedlings of common sprouter species developed the capacity to survive fire within one year of germination. Only five percent of C. clarksoniana seedlings survived in unburnt, and fewer in burnt savanna, three years after germination.
 
 In savanna that remained unburnt for four years, growth of juvenile trees above 2 m in height accounted for the observed increase in tree density. The capacity of the majority of species to sprout after fire, and rapid seed production of non-sprouter species, explained the stability in species composition documented in the annual floristic surveys at Cape Cleveland. Fire-promoted stem reproduction via root-suckering explained the increase in abundance detected in the subshrub Breynia oblongifolia following burning.
 
 This thesis provides important information on the processes that drive tropical savanna function. It indicates that seedling recruitment is a process that limits population growth. Seedling recruitment of trees and shrubs is scarce and episodic, apparently linked to high rainfall years. The seedling recruitment of subshrubs and herbaceous species is driven by opportunities for seed dormancy release, which are primarily restricted to fire events, and limited by the low to moderate soil seed bank density and poor levels of seedling survival. Growth of juvenile trees beyond 2 m in height, and hence to reproductive maturity, requires fire-free intervals of at least four years and is therefore an event that is restricted by fire and limits population growth. The high proportion of sprouting species enables plant persistence, so that juvenile and mature plant survival are life events that provide population resilience. For ephemeral species, the soil seed bank provides a storage mechanism that provides population resilience. 
 
 This thesis provides practical information to improve the management of this widespread and important ecosystem. Conservation management of these savannas will need to balance the role of regular fires in maintaining the diversity of herbaceous species with the requirement of fire intervals of at least four years for allowing recruitment, and therefore population maintenance, of trees. While late dry season fires may cause some tree mortality, the use of occasional late fires will promote dense seedling recruitment of herbaceous species, which may be necessary to maintain sustainable populations of many grasses and forbs.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/205/2/Paul_Williams_thesis.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contributions to crop improvement and sustainable agriculture in tropical and subtropical Australia</field><field name="creator">Lawn, RJ</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT  During the past 36 years, the Author has contributed to the science and practice of agriculture in tropical and subtropical Australia, in the areas of crop improvement and sustainable agricultural production. These contributions were made during three phases of activity (i) through postgraduate studies at the University of Queensland (M Agr Sc, 1968-1971) and at the University of Minnesota (Ph D, 1971-1973); (ii) as a research scientist with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (1973-1994); and (iii) through leadership of the Cooperative Research Centre for Sustainable Sugar Production (CRC Sugar) and its education program, and concurrently as professor of tropical crop science at James Cook University (1994-2003).  Contributions during the period 1968-1994 focussed heavily on developing a scientific understanding of the physiological basis of genotype X environment (g X e) interaction effects on the phenology, growth and yield of tropical grain legume crops. The main target crops were soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.), mungbean (Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek) and black gram (V. mungo L. Hepper), and to a lesser extent cowpea (V. unguiculata (L.) Walp.), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millspaugh) and minor pulses in the Vigna group (rice bean, adzuki bean). Particular emphasis was placed on elucidating the physiological basis of adaptation of these legumes in tropical and subtropical environments, and the implications for crop improvement.  The physiological processes of main interest were phenological development, crop growth, yield and its components, seed quality and symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Environmental factors of main interest were day length, temperature, and water supply (both in excess and deficit), with some lesser focus on biotic factors such as insects and crop diseases. It was established that differential genotypic responses to photo-thermal regime contributed to variation in phenological response, with major implications for crop growth and yield potential and adaptation to the environment with respect to latitude and sowing date. These in turn interacted with agronomy and influenced optimal management.  In the process, genotypic relations between rate of development and photoperiod and temperature in the field were described and quantified, as were the relations between crop duration, harvest index, biomass accumulation and seed yield. Interaction effects between varietal duration and sowing density were explained and the implications for optimal sowing density established for both irrigated and rain fed crops. Advances were made in understanding the effects of host plant physiology on nitrogen fixation. Relations between harvest index and nitrogen harvest index in different legumes and their implications for crop improvement were described. Differences in drought stress response strategy among tropical grain legumes were discovered and described. The ability of soybean to acclimate to saturated soil was described and the novel saturated soil culture system developed. Advances were made in understanding the physiology of weathering in mungbean and black gram, and genotypic differences in resistance were identified.  Studies were extended beyond the cultivated germplasm to explore the natural genotypic variation for traits of agronomic and/or adaptive significance in related wild Vigna and Glycine species found in Australian and nearby islands. In the process, a unique collection of more than 400 native legume accessions was assembled and described, and seed committed to long-term storage in a national germplasm collection. Cross-fertility between cultivated and wild Vigna species was explored and the inheritance of key traits documented.  The research findings on the tropical grain legumes were synthesised into a more coherent generalised understanding of their physiology, and the potential application of physiological knowledge in crop improvement was explored using the tropical grain legumes as a model.  The then-novel idea was advanced that the most effective use of physiology in crop improvement was in developing a biological understanding of g X e to augment the statistical models used by breeders. It was also argued that crop improvement should concurrently involve breeding better adapted crop varieties, and developing agronomic practices that best enabled the genetic potential of crop varieties to be exploited. Among the areas where these concepts were applied was the novel concept of using the long-juvenile gene to &#8216;convert&#8217; high-yielding, lodging resistant, temperate soybean germplasm to tropical adaptation.  During the period 1994-2003, scientific contributions focussed on improving the sustainability of sugar production systems in northern Australia, with emphasis on three broad program areas: enhancing crop productivity, sustaining soil and water resources, and protecting the wider environment. Contributions included a leadership role in the development in collaboration with others of novel approaches for fostering team-based, multi-disciplinary research and postgraduate research training on complex sustainability issues. At a personal research level, the focus was on the application in the context of student training projects of physiological concepts to improve sugarcane productivity in the wet tropics. Advances were made in identifying the effects of harvest timing and other management practices on cane yield and CCS, in quantifying the effects of lodging on productivity and in elucidating environmental stimuli of suckering.  The improved scientific understanding of soybean and mungbean provided the basis for undertaking, in collaboration with others, improvement programs on these legumes for northern Australia, and in Thailand and Vietnam. Recommendations for agronomic management of these crops were promulgated in collaboration with industry, and three cultivars (1 tropical soybean, 1 mungbean and 1 black gram) were released for commercial production. These outputs contributed to the establishment and subsequent development of soybean and mungbean cropping in northern Australia. In the case of sugar cane, the strategic research on low productivity in the wet tropics focussed attention on lodging and suckering as key constraints in the wet tropics, while the research on sustainable sugar production more generally has helped map the path for a sustainable future for the sugar industry.  In the research on both grain legumes and sugar cane, innovation was demonstrated in the contributions that were made, and in the processes whereby they were accomplished. The research on new grain legume crops for Australian agriculture was by definition novel, as was the early focus on using physiological understanding of these species to develop biological explanations for g X e. The use of contestable industry research funds to support postgraduate research training pre-dated the formal introduction of postgraduate research training scholarships by the rural industry research and development committees, while the extensive supervision of postgraduate students was then unprecedented for a CSIRO scientist.  Also demonstrated was leadership in fostering team-based, multi-disciplinary collaborations, often in the context of joint projects supported by national and international agencies, and in developing countries where the tropical crops of interest were widely grown. The research was also usually undertaken in close collaboration with relevant industry interests, which facilitated uptake of the outputs. At the time, these collaborations, which included students, colleagues and industry end-users, initially with funding support from industry and later from the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) and then the Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) Program, were at the forefront of the development of team-based R&amp;D models in Australia.  The synergies from these collaborations with colleagues, students and industry stakeholders enhanced the contributions that were able to be made. They also enabled initial discoveries to be explored and elaborated in ways that otherwise would not have been possible.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/279/1/RJ_Lawn_2004._Contributions_to_Crop_Improvement.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainable domestic energy use in North Queensland</field><field name="creator">Goudie, Douglas</field><field name="description">Five hundred householders were interviewed to gain an understanding of domestic electricity use in Mt Isa and Townsville. Collaborating with the North Queensland Electricity Board, reported behaviour and indications of attitude toward energy were related to metered electricity use. This was done to find causes of electricity wastage by North Queensland householders; develop recommendations to reduce that wastage, and develop strategies to reduce the evening peak electricity demand. Analysis showed little connection between stated attitudes to energy conservation and electricity used by householders. An extensive literature review confirms my findings that many people lack knowledge clarifying energy supply and use issues, and lack meaningful price signals to take energy conservation and renewable energy seriously. Increased electricity price was reported as the most likely cause for serious personal electricity conservation. I conclude that extensive public education about energy supply and use should be coupled with responsible pricing of electricity, to encourage urban dwellers to develop more sustainable energy supply and use patterns. About half of domestic energy in the tropics is used for cooling food, drink and interior space during the hotter months. Rationalising use of air conditioners, refrigerators and freezers, and encouraging passive building design should be strenuously promoted by environmentally responsible government.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/377/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/377/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Continuity and change: Education policy and historiography of education in Western Samoa</field><field name="creator">Auva&#8217;a, Tololima Leifi</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the theme of continuity and change in Western Samoan education. It does so by looking at recent policy documents and at accounts of the history of education in Western Samoa written over more than a century. It compares the treatments of continuity and change in the policy documents and in the histories to show the extent to which both reflect a similar view of the place of continuity and change in Western Samoan culture and education. The study documents and analyses current education policies and strategies in Western Samoa through the two key documents which outline the broad policy directions for education and the strategies for achieving them, respectively, supplemented by Department of Education Annual Reports. It outlines the process of redeveloping policies from early to mid-1990s and the general character of the policies as a whole, and looks more closely at statements of the purposes of education, curriculum and pedagogy, and outcomes of the policies in terms of the distribution of educational provision and participation in education. Throughout, these policies are shown to reflect concern with both the maintenance of traditional Samoa culture &#8211; the fa&#8217;aSamoa &#8211; and the need to change to adapt to the demands of a modern global economy. It also examines a range of historical accounts of Western Samoa and, in particular, the history of education through four periods of development: traditional society, the missionary period, colonial rule, and early independent Western Samoa. It uses three types of account: accounts that are written in, or close to the periods to which they refer, such as missionary accounts of Western Samoan society and education in what is identified as the missionary period; late twentieth century histories of Western Samoa; and historical overviews used to frame late twentieth century official reports. The analysis of these accounts focuses on the purposes of education in different periods, curriculum and pedagogy, and the outcomes of education, again in terms of the distribution of educational provision and participation in education. It analyses these histories in terms of continuity and change, and argues that such histories suggest that Western Samoan history has always been characterised by a balance between continuity and change: the fa&#8217;aSamoa has adapted to changing circumstances in ways that have allowed it to maintain core values, but resisted changes that would threaten those core values. Finally, the thesis compares the understandings of the ways in which continuity and change have been balanced as suggested in the histories with those to be found in the policy documents. It argues that throughout its history, Western Samoa has maintained the strength of its indigenous tradition and cultural values. At the same time, since the arrival of the missionaries, it has selectively welcomed and adopted western practices and values, simultaneously adapting itself to them, and them to its own traditional practices and values. Current policies appear to continue this tradition of selective adaptation to change while continuing to maintain core values of the fa&#8217;aSamaoa. This suggests that the policies are well calculated both to hold the support of the Western Samoan people, and to enable Western Samoa to holds its place in the global community.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/378/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/378/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Die Rolle des TEA/ATTS-Transkriptionsfaktors CaTEC1p bei der Hyphenbildung und Virulenz von Candida albicans</field><field name="creator">Schweizer, AS</field><field name="description">The TEA transcription factor CaTec1p regulates morphogenetic development of the human fungal pathogen C. albicans in vitro.

Reinforcement learning problems require improvement of behaviour based on received rewards. Q-Learning has the potential to reduce robot programming effort and increase the range of robot abilities. However, most currentQ-learning systems are not suitable for robotics problems: they treat continuous variables, for example speeds or positions, as discretised values. Discretisation does not allow smooth control and does not fully exploit sensed information. A practical algorithm must also cope with real-time constraints, sensing and actuation delays, and incorrect sensor data. This research describes an algorithm that deals with continuous state and action variables without discretising. The algorithm is evaluated with vision-based mobile robot and active head gaze control tasks. As well as learning the basic control tasks, the algorithm learns to compensate for delays in sensing and actuation by predicting the behaviour of its environment. Although the learned dynamic model is implicit in the controller, it is possible to extract some aspects of the model. The extracted models are compared to theoretically derived models of environment behaviour. The difficulty of working with robots motivates development of methods that reduce experimentation time. This research exploits Q-learning&#8217;s ability to learn by passively observing the robot&#8217;s actions&#8212;rather than necessarily controlling the robot. This is a valuable tool for shortening the duration of learning experiments.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/623/1/gaskettthesis.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Patterns and processes of reef recovery and human resource use in the Lakshadweep Islands, Indian Ocean</field><field name="creator">Arthur, Rohan</field><field name="description">Finding solutions that effectively conserve natural areas while simultaneously protecting the sustenance rights of resource stakeholders is a considerable challenge for ecosystem managers and scientists. In complex ecosystems like tropical coral reefs, the problem of management is further confounded by an inadequate understanding of how ecosystem function will respond to changes in environmental or management conditions. Given this uncertainty, managers are looking at ways to support and enhance the natural buffering capacity of ecosystems in the face of change, i.e. ecosystem resilience. Human use of natural areas can profoundly modify this resilience, particularly in the developing tropics, where a large proportion of the population depends directly on natural areas for daily sustenance. In these areas, developing and implementing effective management solutions requires a close understanding of both ecosystem processes and the factors affecting human interactions with the ecosystem. This study examined the processes of ecosystem change after a major mass mortality of coral in the Lakshadweep Islands and the consequences that changes in resource use and policy have had on the recovery potential of these reefs. The Lakshadweep Islands are a group of atolls in northern Indian Ocean. The El Ni&#241;o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) of 1998 resulted in anomalous sea surface temperatures (SSTs) that caused extensive coral mortality in the reefs. I studied the patterns of recovery of coral and fish communities on outer reefs on three atolls, Agatti, Kadmat and Kavaratti from 2000 to 2003. Corals showed a mixed pattern of recovery: sites on the eastern aspects of islands showed little recovery of coral cover, while sites on the west showed a rapid increase in coral cover. This difference between aspects appears to be a function of the degree of exposure of these sites to seasonal monsoonal storms, and differences in the long-term stability of coral settlement substrate between aspects. Genera of coral that showed the most significant gains represented two very different life history strategies. Porites and Goniastrea were generally more resistant to bleaching stress. In contrast, Acropora was highly susceptible to bleaching, but recovered very quickly from disturbances by recruiting in large numbers, and sustaining high growth rates once established. Fish communities in coral reefs are naturally very variable, but there were noticeable trends in fish assemblages after bleaching in the Lakshadweep. Species richness and diversity increased from 2000 to 2003 at all sites. Herbivorous fishes such as surgeonfish and parrotfish were very abundant in post-bleached reefs, representing up to 70% of all trophic guilds in the reef in 2000. The dominance of herbivores declined with time as coral took over from algal turf in many reefs. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis of fish communities indicated that fish assemblages were moving towards increasing similarity with time, possibly approaching a post-disturbance equilibrium. I interpret the recovery of Lakshadweep&#8217;s reefs to disturbance within the conceptual framework of catastrophe theory. Catastrophe theory has been effectively used in several other ecosystems as a phenomenological model of ecosystem change, and the applicability of the two-factor cusp catastrophe is a useful conceptual model of reef responses to disturbance. This theory suggests that in the face of global warming, managers and scientists many need to invest their energies in understanding uncertainty on the one hand while managing for resilience on the other. Biotic studies in the reefs of the Lakshadweep indicated that although the fine-scale patterns of recovery are variable, the reefs appear to be highly resilient after coral mortality. The current pattern of resource use practised in the Lakshadweep contributed in part to this high resilience. Despite being among the most densely populated locations in India, with over 2200 people/km2, for most of the year the human population of the Lakshadweep do not depend on the reef for food. This situation largely results from a development initiative started by the Fisheries Department in the 1960s which actively converted reef fishers to pelagic tuna fishing with a series of subsidies and training programmes. This initiative was implemented solely to enhance economic development of the islands, but it has inadvertently released reefs from a potentially large resource extraction pressure. Thus local regulations have played an important if inadvertent role in controlling marine resource use in the Lakshadweep. The Lakshadweep case study has important lessons for resource conservation in the developing tropics. The coral reefs of the Lakshadweep apparently possess considerable resilience in the face of catastrophic coral mortality. One of the major contributors to this resilience was the relatively low level of fishing pressure on these reefs, despite high human population densities. The policy change that was responsible for a shift away from reef fishing was designed primarily as a developmental activity, but it had significant, but completely unintended positive consequences for the resilience of the reef. The Marine Protected Area (MPA) is the principal tool currently used to manage the vanishing diversity of threatened ecosystems like coral reefs. While MPAs may still be the most effective solution in marine conservation, MPAs are often difficult and expensive to establish and maintain. It is even more difficult to get local communities to reconcile with a loss of access to resource areas. The Lakshadweep example suggests that there may be alternative paths to enhance ecosystem resilience that are perhaps as effective in achieving conservation goals. It is not often that ecosystem conservation and human development can pull in the same direction, but when they do, this synergy should be encouraged and supported.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/639/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/639/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceptions of preparedness for bushfire: a case study of Tamborine Mountain</field><field name="creator">Balcombe, Luke John</field><field name="description">The research explored perceptions of preparedness for bushfire-related matters at the rural-urban community of Tamborine Mountain. A literature review expressed the need for changes in bushfire mitigation/management as a result of the need for increased self-reliance. The social construction of risk methodology was applied to a multi-method case study to derive and deliver an analysis of agreements and differences in the perceptions/expectations of fire services and the community (see results below).
 
 How the fire services&#8217; and the community&#8217;s perceptions/expectations agreed: 
 1. There are varied degrees of perception regarding bushfire risk.
 2. Experience with fire appears to be related to awareness of associated risks.
 3. Risk awareness does not appear to be related to recent Australian bushfire events.
 4. The overall view was that fire breaks are a necessary fire management initiative.
 5. The local bushfire season was perceived to be from early spring to summer.
 6. There is a need for Bushfire Management Plans to be effectively implemented.
 
 
 How the fire services&#8217; and the community&#8217;s perceptions/expectations differed: 
 
 Fire services&#8217; perspective: 
 1. Most people in the community would rely on fire services to respond in the event of a fire.
 2. Most people are unaware of the bushfire risk.
 3. The public expects things to be done for them.
 4. Controlled burns are not wanted by the public.
 5. Provision of advice is possible but can not tell residents they need to take action.
 
 Community&#8217;s perspective: 
 1. At least half of survey respondents reported they would not rely on help from fire services in the event of a fire.
 2. Most people reported being aware of the bushfire risk but have other priorities in their life that take precedence.
 3. The survey results indicated that individual householders see themselves as the most responsible for personal and home safety.
 4. Respondents supported controlled burns as long as they are carefully done.
 5. Respondents reported feeling frustrated that specific advice is not provided.
 
 
 Bushfire-related matters that need further resolution: 
 Also important for the basis of discussion are some bushfire-related matters that need further resolution. These matters are separate from how the perceptions/expectations agreed and differed because they were solely from either the fire services&#8217; or the community&#8217;s perspective (as represented below).
 
 
 Bushfire-related matters identified through interviews with the fire services: 
 1. Fire services perceive there is confusion within the community about the roles of urban and rural fire brigades.
 2. Fire services want to improve their capacity to convert data and information relevant to bushfire mitigation and management into knowledge to guide decisions.
 3. Fire services were interested in how they can inform the public of the need for preparation against the risk of bushfire without sensationalising the topic.
 4. Fire services see that it is necessary to find ways of improving the community&#8217;s
 participation in bushfire mitigation and management.
 
 
 Bushfire-related matters that arose from the community survey and community group interviews: 
 1. Community groups seek operation of optimum controlled burn return intervals.
 2. Research data indicated a high proportion of retired people in the community.
 Strategies need to be developed to effectively engage such resources of time and
 knowledge.
 3. Survey respondents indicated that they are not confident in the costs of protecting property against fire and bushfire safety aspects to do or use if the need arose.
 4. A wide range of media was identified as being the preferred way of receiving information, direct engagement with fire services was the least preferred.
 
 
 Survey and interview results were interpreted into the key research findings (as presented on this and the previous page) and were used as the basis of discussion. The
 research findings were distilled into patterns of language and further summarised into a common language so that they could be compared and combined with similar research such as the findings and recommendations of State and Federal Governments of Australia. A common language related to preparedness for bushfire has the potential for fire services, Governments and communities to move forward with bushfire community education efforts. The research findings indicated that the community&#8217;s preparedness for bushfire was especially associated with the topics of risk perception, experience of  fire, confidence in bushfire safety aspects and responsibility for life/property protection and less associated with controlled burning acceptance, impact of educational efforts and cost/effort required.
 
 The research explored contemporary bushfire issues in an at-risk-from-bushfire Australian rural-urban locality adjacent to and mixed amongst protected areas. The term &#8220;marginalised&#8221; can be used to describe the landscape of some places partly as a result of the effects of bushfire. Some people are &#8220;marginalised&#8221; because of how their perceptions/situation regarding bushfire-related matters shape their behaviours and attitudes towards preparedness for bushfire. This finding is of particular concern to fire services throughout Australia as are expanding rural-urban interface areas, difficulties in impacting upon targeted areas for community education and the possible increase in the incidence of adverse weather conditions. The current situation is that citizens need to be aware of their exposure to hazardous conditions, and share responsibility for the mitigation of bushfires.
 
 The research provides the relevant information to understand preparedness for bushfire issues from the local fire services&#8217; and an at-risk-from-bushfire rural-urban community&#8217;s perspectives. Where there is agreement between fire services and the community, investment in communication is about reinforcing shared perceptions/ expectations. The differences in perceptions/expectations highlight those areas that need particular attention by fire services and communities alike. It was an important priority for the research to effectively capture certain locals&#8217; perspectives, especially those with fire experience so that such invaluable knowledge is recorded. The case study illustrated a snapshot of a rural-urban community with bushfire-related matters as a medium to communicate that. This thesis provided an unbiased account of stakeholder perspectives with an emphasis upon recognition of the different constructions of bushfire risk within a community as a part of the transition towards increased self-sufficiency for bushfire preparations and shared responsibility for the protection of life and property.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2043/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2043/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Broodstock management and egg quality of the pearl oysters Pinctada margaritifera and Pinctada fucata</field><field name="creator">Acosta-Salmon, Hector</field><field name="description">Marine pearl culture is one of the most valuable aquaculture industries in the world with a total estimated value of about US$500 million. The major pearl producing nations are Australia and French Polynesia and, although reliable methods for hatchery culture of pearl oysters were developed in the 1980&#8217;s and 1990&#8217;s, pearl production in these countries still relies primarily on oysters collected from the wild. Generally, the cultured pearl industry, particularly the &#8216;black&#8217; pearl industry, has been slow to adopt important advances in aquaculture and other relevant disciplines and is still based on &#8216;traditional&#8217; methods. Nevertheless, over recent years there has been increasing interest in research relating to general culture methods for pearl oysters and pearl oyster genetics (particularly relating to pearl quality), and there has been increasing reliance on hatchery production. This study addressed important issues relating to broodstock selection, breeding cycle and egg quality in pearl oysters. Pinctada margaritifera and P. fucata were exposed to propylene phenoxetol at a concentration of 2.5 mL L-1 and benzocaine at concentrations of 250, 500 and 1200 mg L-1. Once relaxed, oysters were observed every 5 minutes to evaluate the condition of the mantle and gills. Oysters were classified as either &#8216;suitable saibo&#8217; or &#8216;nonsuitable saibo&#8217; depending on their suitability for use as saibo donors for pearl production. Survival of oysters in all treatments was 100%. With the exception of oysters relaxed with 250 mg L-1 of benzocaine, where no relaxation was recorded, oysters exposed to all other treatments became relaxed and showed good condition and acceptable characteristics to be used as saibo donors. To determine whether mantle tissue could be removed from oysters without mortality, P. margaritifera and P. fucata were anaesthetised with 500 mg L-1 of benzocaine and had the ventral margin of either their left, right or both left and right mantle lobes removed. Survival after 4 weeks was 100% for all treatments and oysters showed regeneration of excised mantle tissue. Mantle border grew back to almost its original extent within 60 days after excision. Muscular fibres within the new tissue were not seen until 30 days after mantle excision. Functional (secretory) abilities were presumably recovered before day 15 when conchiolin secretions and secretory cells were seen in the newly regenerated epithelia. Mantle regeneration in P. margaritifera up to 90 days after mantle excision was similar to that for P. fucata. Anaesthetised oysters can provide mantle tissue for pearl seeding and be kept alive for future uses which may include receptors for pearl production (following seeding season) as broodstock (only those providing mantle that produced high quality pearls) and possibly as multiple saibo donors. A biopsy technique to obtain gonad tissue was assessed in P. margaritifera. Prior to biopsy, oysters were anaesthetised with 2 mL L-1 of propylene phenoxetol. Three different 9 cm long biopsy needles (16, 18 and 20 gauge) with a 10 mm sample notch, were compared as a means of obtaining gonad tissue from 20 oysters. Samples were removed from each oyster using each of the 3 biopsy needles. Following the biopsy procedure, each oyster was killed and the gonad sectioned for standard histological preparation. Samples were observed microscopically to assess gonad condition and to compare samples taken using biopsy with those taken using destructive sampling. Oysters showed 100% recovery from the anaesthetic and biopsy procedure after 2 weeks. Non-destructive biopsy sampling was an accurate means of assessing gonad condition in male pearl oysters. However, the use of thicker biopsy needles (e.g. 14 or 12 gauge) may allow better interpretation of gonad stage, particularly in female oysters for which results showed that 16 gauge biopsy needles (the thickest used in this study) were unsatisfactory. Collection of oysters from culture stock held at Magnetic Island and Orpheus Island was conducted from August 2003 to February 2004 to describe biochemical and histological changes associated to gamete development. Six oysters from each site were collected every month for seven months. Samples of mantle, adductor muscle, gonad and digestive gland were obtained for biochemical analyses. Two spawning peaks (winter and summer) were confirmed for P. margaritifera in north Queensland. The adductor muscle played an important role in storage of protein and carbohydrate during gonad development. To analyse changes in micronutrient composition during embryological development of P. margaritifera, samples of eggs, embryos and larvae were taken for GHWHUPLQDWLRQRIFDURWHQRLGDVFRUELFDFLGYLWDPLQ&amp; -tocopherol (vitamin E) and fatty acid content 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24 and 46 h after fertilisation. Carotenoids were found only in trace amounts in P. margaritifera eggs and probably do not have an important role in embryo development. The vitamin C and vitamin E contents of P. margaritifera embryos increased with time and may not be limiting nutrients for embryological development. The fatty acids 14:0, 16:0 and most unsaturated C18s were highly utilised during embryological development of P. margaritifera as demonstrated by their decline during development. These fatty acids may be good indicators of egg quality. Much of the research in this study was conducted for the first time with pearl oysters. This study describes new and novel information relating to the breeding cycle, broodstock selection and egg quality of pearl oysters. The results of this study provide a basis for more efficient culture methods and may facilitate significant changes to traditional aspects of pearl oyster culture and pearl production.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/941/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/941/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Family affairs: An historical anthropology of state practice and Aboriginal agency in a rural town, North Queensland</field><field name="creator">Babidge, Sally Marie</field><field name="description">This thesis is an historical anthropology of power, a study of the relations between the state and Aboriginal family in Charters Towers, a rural town of approximately 9,000 people, 135km south west of Townsville, North Queensland. In this thesis I argue that the state/society relationship is mutually (if unequally) constituted, and that the relationship (in practice, in discourse, and in the imagination) operates at many levels. The thesis takes up critical evaluations of the anthropological research on family/kinship in rural Aboriginal Australia through an ethnographic study of the practices of family and belonging. I begin by examining the nature of the frontier, in the construction of knowledge across the frontier and the early practices of the state and Aboriginal people in the reproductions of cultural and social boundaries. The reproduction of Aboriginal difference is institutionalised at the turn of the 20th Century when the state creates specific legislation to control Aboriginal people under the rhetoric of &#8216;protection&#8217;. Subsequent state policies of &#8216;assimilation&#8217; and &#8216;self-determination&#8217; are seen as extension of measures of control, although practised by state bureaucracies in novel ways. Under &#8216;recognition&#8217;, in the era of Native Title, Aboriginal difference is &#8216;recognised&#8217; in terms of concepts of &#8216;traditional culture&#8217;: a static de-historicised Aboriginality with which Aboriginal people identify as well as subvert and resist. In the thesis I examine how Aboriginal families are produced and reproduced in ways which are enmeshed in state practice as well as constituted by practice identified as particularly Aboriginal. Utilising archival sources produced by the colonial state, as well as published histories, oral history and ethnography, I analyse the complexities of state intervention into Aboriginal people&#8217;s lives and Aboriginal discourse and practice in response to these measures. An ethnographic study of everyday articulations of &#8216;family&#8217; and of events such as meetings and funerals, demonstrates that relations of kinship are formed and reformed through frequent performance, which as practice creates and recreates the terms of such relations. My engagement with these arguments in relation to Australian Aboriginal anthropology, is distinct in its analysis of the role of power outside of the resistance/domination duality.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/942/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/942/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of nutrition on reproduction in the Eastern Rainbowfish, Melanotaenia splendida splendida</field><field name="creator">Badger, Amanda Catherine</field><field name="description">Fish broodstock raised in an aquaculture setting must be provided with a diet not only adequate to meet the demands of their basic metabolic functions, but also to support reproduction. The frequency, ration, and types of nutrients provided within a diet are all very important to the performance of broodstock. The eastern rainbowfish, Melanotaenia splendida splendida, can be easily reared and readily spawn in captivity. This species has many characteristics that make it a good model species for reproductive experiments and is also commercially important to the aquarium trade. Studies were carried out to investigate the effects of nutrition on reproductive performance of this species. Firstly, experiments were carried out to establish the basic reproductive parameters of M. splendida splendida. Periods of starvation were then carried out to gauge which parameters would be the more effective indicators for reproductive performance of the fish broodstock. It was determined that egg number, survival to eyed embryo, hatching rate, and unfed larval life were the parameters that would indicate reproductive success of this fish. The next two studies were carried out to evaluate feeding frequency and feeding ration on reproductive performance in this species. Different feeding regimes were designed with feeding frequencies at every one, two, three, four and five days and feeding rations of 100%, 50%, 25%, and 12.5% satiation. The results showed that the reproductive parameters significantly declined when fish were fed less then every day, and less then 100% satiation. The effects of energy, protein and lipid content on reproduction were then assessed. Diets containing 17 MJ Kg-1, 14 MJ Kg-1 and 11MJ Kg-1 were made and tested. The 17 MJ KG-1 energy diet resulted in the highest egg number as well as the longest unfed larval life. The protein experiment examined the effects of three protein levels, 35%, 43% and 50%, on reproductive parameters. The results showed that the 35% protein level gave reduced reproductive success (p&lt;0.05). The 43% and 50% level diets gave better reproductive success but between the treatments had no significant differences in reproductive parameters (p&gt;0.05). The 43% protein diet was recommended for subsequent experiments as it resulted in the longest unfed larval life and it would theoretically cost less to provide and would likely reduce water quality problems. Three diets containing 20%, 12% and 9% lipid were evaluated. The 20% lipid diet caused deformities in larvae, and led to reduced fertilisation and hatching rates. The 12% lipid diet gave the best overall results (p&lt;0.05). Three essential fatty acids, arachidonic acid (AA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), were respectively supplemented into three diets, a fourth diet was supplemented with all three fatty acids and a fifth had no fatty acid supplementation and was used as a control. Egg number, survival to eyed embryo and hatching rate were not significantly different in any of the four diets containing no or only one fatty acid(p&gt;0.05), however, supplementation of the diet with all three fatty acids resulted in significantly longer unfed larval life (p&lt;0.05). In summary, the results of the current study showed that a diet containing 17 MJ KG-1 energy, 43% protein, 12% lipid and supplemented with all three fatty acids at the levels tested would maximise the level of reproduction in M. splendida splendida.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/961/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/961/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Melioidis: an investigation of cellular immune responses</field><field name="creator">Barnes, J. L.</field><field name="description">Melioidosis is a potentially fatal disease caused by the soil bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei and is predominantly seen in southeast Asia and northern Australia. Protection from infections with other facultative intracellular bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes and Legionella pneumophila, has been shown to be mediated largely by a cell-mediated immune (CMI) response of the host. B. pseudomallei is also a facultative intracellular bacterium but despite decades of research being conducted on this pathogen, few studies have focussed on the CMI response in melioidosis. The nature of a protective host immune response, and the conditions under which it is induced, are fundamental for improved clinical management of patients and vaccine development. Therefore, the major focus of the research outlined within this thesis was the characterisation of the CMI responses involved in the development of protective immunity in melioidosis. This was achieved using a previously characterised mouse model of acute and chronic melioidosis. Following intravenous (iv) inoculation, BALB/c mice are highly susceptible, and C57BL/6 mice relatively resistant to B. pseudomallei infection. Using the murine model, we compared the pathogenesis of B. pseudomallei infection following inoculation of the bacterium by iv, intraperitoneal (ip), intranasal (in), per os (po) and subcutaneous (sc) routes of infection. These studies emphasized that determination of bacterial virulence is highly dependent on the route of infection. BALB/c mice consistently demonstrated greater susceptibility toward B. pseudomallei, independent of the route of infection. Spleen and liver were the primary organs targeted following infections by all methods tested. Interestingly, following in and po inoculation of C57BL/6 mice, significant levels of bacteria were detected in the brain in the absence of septicemia. Reverse transcriptase-polymerisation chain reaction (RT-PCR) and histology were used to assess the increased expression of messenger (m) ribonucleic acid (RNA) for interferon-&#947;-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), monocyte interferon- &#947; -inducible protein (Mig), regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted chemokine (RANTES), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (KC), macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), macrophage (M)-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF during infection with a highly virulent strain of B. pseudomallei (NCTC 13178). Histological changes and bacterial loads were also monitored in the livers and spleens of C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice infected with NCTC 13178. Disparate expression of mRNA was demonstrated for IP-10, Mig, MCP-1, KC, MIP-2, GM-CSF and M-CSF. The magnitude of cellular responses observed in tissue correlated with increased levels of the chemokines and CSF investigated, as well as bacterial load. Compared with C57BL/6 mice, greater infiltration of neutrophils was observed in liver and spleen of BALB/c mice. In contrast, early lesions in C57BL/6 mice predominantly comprised macrophages. These results suggested that the inability of BALB/c mice to contain the infection at sites of inflammation may underlie the susceptible phenotype of this mouse strain toward B. pseudomallei infection. The nitric oxide (NO) secretory activity of C57BL/6 and BALB/c peritoneal macrophages were compared following in vitro stimulation with B. pseudomallei antigens. Comparable levels of NO were produced by peritoneal macrophages from both mouse strains, suggesting that other antimicrobial mechanisms may underlie differences in the in vitro intracellular killing capacities of peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6 compared to BALB/c mice. However, the low numbers of macrophages observed histologically at sites of B. pseudomallei infection in BALB/c mice suggest that failure to recruit sufficient macrophages to these sites may also contribute to the susceptibility of this mouse strain. The present studies are the first to demonstrate the role of T cell responses in experimental and human melioidosis. Following exposure to a less virulent strain of B. pseudomallei (NCTC 13179), both C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice demonstrated delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses (P&lt;0.05) and lymphocyte proliferation (P&lt;0.05) towards B. pseudomallei antigens. Such a response indicated the generation of B. pseudomallei-specific lymphocytes following initial exposure to the bacterium. The strength of DTH and lymphocyte proliferation responses was dependent on the concentration of the primary inoculating dose. Adoptive transfer experiments were carried out using mononuclear leucocytes (MNL) or purified T cells from spleen of B. pseudomallei-immunised C57BL/6 mice. The transfer of B. pseudomallei-specific MNL to na&#239;ve C57BL/6 mice was demonstrated by a DTH response (P&lt;0.05) to B. pseudomallei antigens. However, these mice were not protected from a subsequent lethal challenge with NCTC 13178. Similarly, recipient mice that received purified T cells were not protected from a subsequent lethal challenge. The results of this study suggested that a single exposure to B. pseudomallei is insufficient to induce a protective adaptive immune response. Therefore, we attempted to induce resistance in susceptible BALB/c mice using repetitive low-dose exposure to live B. pseudomallei NCTC 13179. Immune responses and resistance following sc immunisation with live B. pseudomallei was compared to exposure to B. pseudomallei antigens. Low-dose immunisation with live bacteria induced protection (P&lt;0.01) to a subsequent lethal challenge with NCTC 13178. In comparison, mice immunised with B. pseudomallei antigens were not protected but demonstrated significantly increased levels of IgG2a (P&lt;0.01) and IgG1 (P&lt;0.01) in serum. These findings suggest that although exposure to B. pseudomallei antigens induced a DTH response and lymphocyte proliferation to B. pseudomallei antigens in vitro, the generation of a protective immune response following B. pseudomallei infection requires the presence of live bacteria. The present studies have also given the first evidence of the development of CMI responses to B. pseudomallei in patients who had recovered from melioidosis. Significantly higher lymphocyte proliferation, IFN-&#947; production and activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets were observed in the patient group compared with control subjects after in vitro challenge of peripheral blood mononuclear leucocytes (PBML) cultured with B. pseudomallei antigens. It is tempting to reason that the survival of the patients included in this study was due to the development of a protective adaptive immune response to B. pseudomallei. Strong CMI responses were also demonstrated in subclinical melioidosis infection. Individuals who had been exposed to B. pseudomallei without any clinical manifestations displayed enhanced lymphocyte proliferation and IFN-&#947; production in response to stimulation with B. pseudomallei antigens in vitro, when compared to individuals who had recovered from clinical melioidosis. Such a response may be essential for determining protection following B. pseudomallei infection. In summary, the results of the present studies have provided basic data regarding the involvement of CMI responses during B. pseudomallei infection. They provide evidence supporting an essential role for T cells in the development of an effective adaptive immune response to experimental and human B. pseudomallei infection and suggest that differences in the development of T cell responses may influence the outcome of infection.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/964/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/964/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Toward sustainable urban travel north Queensland</field><field name="creator">Goudie, Douglas</field><field name="description">This project evolved from Honours and Master of Science research focussed on sustainable urban electricity supply, use and attitudes. Researchers, planning practitioners and Australian governments&#8217; policies of ecologically sustainable development helped shape the household questionnaire on urban travel. The main research instrument of this thesis, the survey of 400 households considered prior urban travel research and resource constraints, along with social and environment perspectives. The public research instrument and the survey stratification of sample household&#8217;s distance from the Central Business District were used to test 12 hypotheses. The hypotheses centred on relationships of home location distance from the CBD and household travel distances, fuel costs as an influence on urban travel patterns, and possible links between environmental concern and urban travel behaviour. Attitudes toward all alternative modes of urban travel were tested, while questions on easy ways to reduce car use tested hypothesis on publicly acceptable car-reduction strategies. The thesis was developed within the philosophical and practical framework of Ecologically Sustainable Urban Development. Urban car use consumes much petroleum, facilitates car dependent urban growth and is enjoyed by nearly everyone. Cars are ubiquitous, convenient and generally the preferred mode of travel, although their negative impacts are well understood. Impending petroleum depletion will trigger a defining time of change in urban travel behaviour, structures and landuse. The North Queensland research has shown that people are essentially aware of a future need to reduce car use, but are in no hurry to sacrifice the convenience of car use until something as good or better comes along, or they are forced to alternatives because of increased car costs. The research defines current urban travel in Townsville and Cairns, along with values and beliefs about future urban travel. Cairns and Townsville are ideal study sites, isolated microcosms easily representing larger, more complex transport systems. The survey was stratified to three zones; central, middle and outer, in order to test hypotheses based on choice of home location and consequent travel. Every third house in three randomly selected Collector Districts from each zone received one of 216 questionnaires. A return of 406 forms, about 60%, included written input to 20 openended questions and logged 28,000 Km of travel data from 1,068 residents for one Friday of urban travelling. This thesis documents 3,500 urban trips and analyses how householders believe they may easily reduce current car use. This substantial data set showed that cars were used for 80% of trips, covering 90% of the distance travelled. Non-motorised trips accounted for only 3.5% of the 28,000 Km travelled. Outer residents travelled about the same number of trips as other residents but averaged two to three times the distance per trip. Urban distance travelled is very dependent on home location choices and residents are very self-aware of car dependence. The main reason for central living was proximity to householder&#8217;s usual destinations, also true for the middle zones, along with property prices. Outer zone residents usually chose their homes because of natural features or a large block of land. While recognising it to be very car dependent, people were generally satisfied with their current urban travel. There was widespread belief that better public transport and better planning of trips would reduce car use. Walking and cycling were seen as healthy exercise, but dangerous. There was a uniformly high level of environmental awareness and concern. Overall, people generally understand sustainability issues and were often quite sophisticated in that understanding. A simple theoretical model was developed inductively to help link internal and external space with price signals and changed urban travel behaviour. Price signals underlie choices of home location and urban travel options. Although environmental issues associated with unconstrained car use are understood by the public, their sheer convenience means cars will dominate urban travel until other modes become safer and more attractive. The main long-term deterrent to overwhelming car dependence will only be impending and major rises in the price of fuel. Twenty-two surveyed urban travel or energy experts identified cheap, easy ways to help reduce car use by such means as making walking or cycling along more continuous and well defined paths feels safe, and by clarifying bus movements at bus stops. I hope this work makes some lasting contribution to long-term urban settlement.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/967/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/967/2/02chapters1-6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/967/3/03references.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/967/4/04appendices1-26.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Planning for the future: a profile of Australian tourist attractions</field><field name="creator">Benckendorff, Pierre Jacques</field><field name="description">Tourist attractions are frequently described as the key components of a destination&#8217;s tourism industry, yet they are under-researched and poorly understood. This thesis was designed to assist tourism researchers, and potentially tourism operators, to think about the future of tourist attractions in Australia, with particular reference to planning and management. The thesis considered three areas of literature. Chapter 1 began with an overview of the definitions, classifications and current knowledge about tourist `attractions. The review continued with a broad appraisal of trends that had the potential to influence tourist attractions in the next 20 to 50 years. In chapter 2, a third source of inquiry explored the strategic planning literature in an effort to examine relevant issues and common approaches to studying planning in organisations. The review of literature resulted in nine key aims being proposed for this thesis. These aims were linked by a primary aim, which was: &#8216;to evaluate and understand how Australian tourist attraction operators plan for the future&#8217;. To achieve the aims of this thesis a mixed method approach was used to deliver the results in three interrelated studies. In broad terms, this thesis examined (1) where Australian attractions are now; (2) how attraction operators plan for the future; and (3) what that future might entail. Study one employed a quantitative methodology consisting of mail questionnaires to evaluate the organisational and planning characteristics of the tourist attraction sector. The results, reported in Chapters 3 and 4, provided a detailed summary of the business characteristics of attractions and confirmed anecdotal observations that the attraction sector consisted of many small operators and a small number of large well-recognised commercial attractions. The research identified four levels of planning based on the short term and long term planning focus of attractions. A key finding was that planning, whether short term or long-term, was positively associated with a number of desirable attraction characteristics. It was concluded that planners outperformed non-planners in terms of visitor numbers, visitor growth, paid employee numbers, asset value, gross revenue, and total profit. Higher levels of planning were also associated with higher admission prices, a longer length of stay and a greater number of open days. Managers who plan also appeared to be substantially more confident about their attraction, but were also likely to have lower management tenure. Study 2 summarised the results of a qualitative study based on twelve semi-structured interviews with attraction managers from three states along Australia&#8217;s east coast. The qualitative approach, reported in Chapter 5, reinforced some of the patterns observed in the quantitative study, while adding additional detail and explanatory insight. In particular, the findings reported that there were important differences in planning between small attractions and large attractions. Large attractions tended to have more formal, systematic approaches to planning, while smaller attractions tended to adopt more casual, operational planning approach. It was found that tourist attraction planning systems contained elements of the Rational Strategic Model (RSM) of strategic planning reported in the literature, but were less formal and more operational in nature. There was a tendency for managers to continually monitor the environment rather than employing defined environment analysis tasks during the planning cycle. Monitoring of the external environment was typically focussed on the task environment (microenvironment), rather than broader environmental influences. Identity also appeared to be much more prominent in attraction planning than was suggested in the broader planning literature. The third and final study presented in Chapter 6 used a novel futures wheel methodology to consider how trends in the medium-term future may impact on tourist attractions. The research distilled 62 trends from the futures literature and presented these to three think tanks, who were asked to rate the importance and certainty of these trends in the context of the future of Australian attractions. The most important, but least certain trends were then selected for further analysis by the think tanks. The results compared favourably with other research by confirming important attraction trends in the areas attraction alliances, people and capacity management, enlivening attractions, increased professionalism, and balancing technology and human interaction. The findings also provided an evaluation of the strengths and limitations of the futures wheel method and suggested that, when coupled with a grounded theory approach, the technique may be suitable for investigating the future of a range of tourism contexts. The final chapter of the thesis provided a synthesis of the results and presented and integrative model of the planning process in tourist attractions. Aspects of chapter 4 of this thesis have been published in the Journal of Travel Research (Benckendorff and Pearce, 2003). Highlights of the results presented in Chapters 3 and 4 were also reported to participants of the research. It is hoped that this broad overview from one continent will stimulate the further study of tourist attractions.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/970/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/970/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#8216;We're the mob you should be listening to&#8217;: aboriginal elders talk about community school relationships on Mornington Island</field><field name="creator">Bond, Hilary</field><field name="description">The thesis explores the relationships the Elders of Mornington Island, a &#8216;closed&#8217;, geographically-remote Aboriginal community, perceive as prevailing between the school and the community, and the relationships that they believe should exist between the community and the local school and its teachers. The Elders, or Lawmen, a body of Aboriginal senior men, see themselves as the repositories and teachers of tribal Aboriginal Law that has been handed down from their Creation Ancestors for thousands of years and is still being handed down. The thesis documents and explores their accounts of the relationships they have had with non-Aboriginal people in the past and, in particular, the relationships they prefer to have with the teachers and school respectively. This thesis does not explore the perspectives or cultural narratives of the schoolteachers or administrators. The thesis draws on critical theory, seeing both the wider society and the local society of Mornington Island as dynamic structures in which some sectors of society, in this case Aboriginal people, are oppressed, with dire consequences in many aspects of their individual and collective lives. It also draws on critical theory in adopting an ethical position of solidarity with, and compassion for, those whose lives are thus impaired. It shares with the Elders this sense that Aboriginal people have been, and continue to be oppressed, and explores individual and institutional dimensions of race relations, manifested in ideology, physical coercion, personal attitude and interpersonal relations. The main body of data comprises an extended series of open-ended conversational interviews with twenty-five Lawmen and eleven other senior Mornington Islanders. Initially conversations were tape-recorded, but at the request of participants, this practice was abandoned in favour of handwritten notes of interviews. All records of interviews were returned to the respective contributors (and read to them, where appropriate or necessary) for approval or amendment. In practice, these readings became the stimulus and occasion for further conversations. The thesis treats the material thus provided as reflecting and constructing a particular knowledge and understanding of the world; it makes no judgements about its ontological status or its epistemological foundations, but takes it at face value as an account of the world as the Elders encounter it. In analysing the material, the thesis identifies several key dimensions of their understandings of relations between community and school, and explores emergent themes within each of these dimensions, with a view to recognising both the commonalities and multiplicities of views across interviews. In doing so, the thesis seeks to represent the Elders&#8217; views as fully as possible and to give pride of place to their understandings. The Elders perceive that the secular past affects the present and that the sacred past is permanently present. In describing and accounting for the present and in constructing a proper future, they recurrently draw on the past. They construct the present and accounts of what should be, on the basis of both the eternal spiritual Law and the secular past. The secular past they recount is full of racism, inequality, loss and oppression. The normative present and future are fundamentally grounded in traditional Law: all relationships should be based on Law. The Elders are disappointed that the young people in the community do not know their relationship categories according traditional Law and that the community is characterised by disorder, collectively and individually. They attribute this disordered present to colonialism, past and present. The Elders want better relations with school staff, but they see the teachers standing outside the structure of kin relations and as &#8216;standoffish&#8217; and selfsegregating. The Elders believe the teachers should be open, personally, and available to be incorporated by the community into its kin-based social structure. The Elders consider that the school gives them no voice in curriculum and pedagogy. They insist that they should be heard on such matters. They perceive the teachers as having a coercive pedagogy, and see their interest in the children as confined to the school. They insist that pedagogy ought to be caring and inclusive, that teachers should recognise, and extend their interest to, the wider context of students&#8217; lives, and that their pedagogy should reflect this. The Elders see the curriculum as a bastardised version of a mainstream, urban curriculum. The Elders insist that the curriculum should provide significant space for themselves to teach Law and culture and to able to educate the young people in traditional ways. Equally, they insist that the Western component of the curriculum should be of the highest standard, by mainstream, urban criteria. This study shows that the Elders have severe misgivings about both the prevailing relations and the contribution of the school to what they insistently refer to as their tribal community. It argues that the fact that the school appears this way to the Elders, as the senior figures of the community, is itself a problem, and that in so far as their views might be more widely shared, the problem is even more critical.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/971/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/971/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The humoral immune response of Lates
 calcarifer to Streptococcus iniae</field><field name="creator">Bromage, Erin</field><field name="description">This study characterises various aspects of barramundi (Lates calcarifer)
 humoral immunity, including ontogeny, temperature modulation and kinetics
 following challenge with Streptococcus iniae. It was discovered that
 Staphylococcal protein A (SpA) was able to efficiently isolate antibody from
 serum, and that all barramundi Ig found in serum is tetrameric with a weight
 of approximately 800 kDa. This tetramer is composed of 8 heavy chains (72
 kDa) and 8 light chains (28 kDa). Denaturing, non-reducing electrophoresis
 demonstrated differential disulfide polymerization (redox forms) of the
 tetrameric Ig which was consistent with those observed with other species.
 Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were produced against the protein A
 purified barramundi Ig, and various ELISA formats were developed. These
 serological tools were used to investigate aspects of barramundi humoral
 immunity.
 Examination of ontogeny of humoral immunity, revealed that barramundi
 possess minimal maternal antibody (&lt;10 &#956;g/ml wet weight) post-hatch, which
 is depleted rapidly (within 3 days). By day 8 systemic Ig is able to be
 detected, which continues to increase over the following months. However, it
 is not until seven week post-hatch that barramundi fingerlings are able to
 mount a prolonged immune response following vaccination with S. iniae.
 Environmental temperature was also found to significantly impact the ability
 of barramundi to respond to vaccination with S. iniae. Barramundi
 maintained at low temperatures (&lt;230C) displayed a diminished, delayed and
 highly variable humoral immune response following vaccination, with many of
 the experimental animals failing to respond to primary vaccination. These
 responses could be mediated by either administering a booster vaccine or by
 elevating the environmental temperature.
 This study also demonstrated that there was a relationship with specific
 serum antibody and protection against S. iniae, with fish possessing high levels of specific Ig being protected from lethal challenge, while those with
 low titres being more susceptible to disease. Specific antibody in barramundi
 could be generated through natural exposure to the bacterium from the
 environment or through vaccination. Thus bath vaccination of fish (50,000)
 held at two facilities resulted in elevated systemic antibody levels and lower
 observed mortality, when compared to the unvaccinated control fish.
 Infections due to S. iniae were determined to be associated with elevated
 water temperatures. Laboratory trials and field data indicated that water
 temperatures between 24 and 280C resulted in the highest barramundi
 mortality. A weak association was also determined with low pH and
 mortality, with fish exposed to low pH&#8217;s (&lt;6.0) being more susceptible to
 infection. No association was observed with mortality and salinity.
 Four monoclonal antibodies (Mab&#8217;s) were also generated against a 21 kDa
 protein from cell wall of S. iniae. The Mab&#8217;s displayed a high level of
 specificity for S. iniae, including those from Australia, Israel and America, and
 minimal cross-reactivity with other bacterial species tested. The Mab&#8217;s were
 used in an immunohistochemical study that confirmed the neurotropic nature
 of S. iniae infections, as well as demonstrating the presence of the bacterium
 in the intestine of infected fish.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1007/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1007/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards development of a formulated diet for mud crab (Scylla serrata) larvae, with emphasis on lipid nutrition</field><field name="creator">Holme, May-Helen</field><field name="description">Crabs of the genus Scylla, commonly referred to as mud crabs, are commercially important crabs with an Indo-Pacific distribution. Scylla serrata is the most widespread of the four recognized Scylla species, and it has traditionally been an important fishery in coastal communities throughout its range. In recent decades it has also become a targeted species for aquaculture, however, due to a lack of low cost formulated diets, mass production of mud crab seed stock is not reliable, and the majority of mud crab farms rely on juveniles caught in the wild. This has lead to a widespread seeds-stock shortage and over-exploitation of wild populations. Development of more effective hatchery techniques and more reliable production of juveniles are therefore considered critically important for sustainable growth of the mud crab farming industry in this region.
 
 Current methods for Scylla hatchery production rely on live foods such as rotifers and
 Artemia. These prey species are costly to produce, have an inconsistent nutritional profile and lack certain nutritional components essential for normal growth of marine larvae. Development of a nutritionally optimised diet is therefore considered critically important, and recent research at James Cook University has shown that mud crab larvae readily accept microbound diet (MBD) particles. As the contents of such diets easily can be manipulated, MBD shows enormous potential as a tool for further specification of the nutritional requirement of mud crab larvae.
 
 Lipids are required in crustacean diets as an important source of energy, essential fatty acids, sterols, phospholipids and fat-soluble vitamins. An appropriate supply of these nutrients is particularly critical during larval development, where a series of important morphological, physiological and biochemical changes take place. On this basis, this thesis was designed to first collect and review all information on the nutritional requirements of S. serrata larvae published to date, and highlight areas where more research is required. Experiments were then conducted to fill gaps in our current knowledge on larval dietary lipid requirements. Some of the most important aspects of lipid metabolism; dietary cholesterol requirements, interaction between cholesterol and phospholipids, the optimum balance of dietary n-3 and n-6 fatty acids, as well as lipid class and fatty acid utilization by developing larvae have been addressed in separate chapters, with the aim to provide information assisting formulation of more appropriate species-specific MBD for S. serrata larval culture.
 
 While previous experiments have demonstrated that megalopae of the mud crab can be cultured exclusively on MBD, the potential of MBD as a food source for zoea larvae of the same species has not previously been determined. The first experiment of this thesis was therefore set up to investigate the effect of partial and total replacement of live food with MBD for zoeal larvae, with the aim to determine the best suited larvae stage for further nutritional studies. Zoea III larvae were cultured communally at a density of 25 larvae L-1 and were fed either 100% live Artemia nauplii, 100% MBD or a 50%:50% combination of MBD and Artemia nauplii. Highest survival (66%) and development rate to the zoea IV stage were recorded for larvae fed the 50%:50% combination of MBD and Artemia nauplii. Some successful molts were also found among larvae fed exclusively on MBD, while total mortality was observed in the unfed control. The results indicate that the experimental MBD may contain certain beneficial nutrients lacking in Artemia nauplii, and that co-feeding the MBD with Artemia nauplii enhanced larval survival and development. However, the findings also suggested that total replacement of live food with the experimental MBD will result in poor survival of zoea III larvae, and based on these data, the megalopa stage was chosen as the most appropriate larval stage for further studies.
 
 The experimental MBD previously used for rearing S. serrata megalopa contained a high proportion of dried rotifers (38% of total diet dry weight). Although this work demonstrated that mud crab megalopa readily ingest and assimilate formulated diet particles, it did not reduce the reliance on live food cultures. Fundamental to the  success of this study was therefore to replace the rotifer components with a commercially available protein source, and four marine animal meals (rotifer meal, Artemia meal, fish meal and squid meal) were evaluated based on larval survival, dry weight and carapace weight of newly molted first stage crabs (C1) and development time from megalopa to C1. Fifteen megalopae were reared individually in 250 mL aquaria, and survival of MBD-fed megalopae to C1 ranged from 46.7% to 60.0% with those fed MBD containing fish meal or squid meal showing higher survival than those fed MBD containing dried Artemia or rotifers. Larvae fed live Artemia nauplii showed the highest overall survival (80%), while none of the unfed megalopae survived to C1. There were no significant differences (P &gt;0.05) in the average time required for megalopae to reach the first crab stage when fed any of the four MBD, however, shortest development time was recorded for larvae fed live Artemia nauplii. The results indicate that squid meal is a suitable protein source for formulation of MBD for S. serrata megalopae, and this meal was used in MBD formulated for subsequent experiments.
 
 Cholesterol is an important sterol, serving as a precursor for many physiological compounds such as sex and molting hormones, adrenal corticoids, bile acids and vitamin D. As crustaceans are incapable of de novo production of cholesterol, dietary cholesterol is essential for optimum growth and high survival in crustaceans. Chapter 4 of this thesis reports on an experiment assessing the effects of dietary cholesterol levels on growth, development time and survival of mud crab megalopae. Five semi-purified, iso-nitrogenous and iso-energetic MBD containing cholesterol levels from 0.14% to 1.00% diet dry weight were tested, using fifteen individually reared megalopae for each dietary treatment. The results showed that megalopae from all treatments were able to metamorphose to the first crab stage, suggesting that the endogenous level of cholesterol in the basal diet (0.14%) was sufficient to meet dietary requirements.
 
 Highest overall survival (74.3%) was recorded for megalopae fed a diet containing
 0.80% cholesterol, while the widest mean carapace width (3.53 &#177; 0.08 mm) and highest mean dry weight (21.11 &#177; 2.22 mg) were recorded for juveniles molting from
 megalopae fed live Artemia. No megalopae in the unfed control treatment
 metamorphosed into crabs. The average development time from megalopa to the C1
 stage varied among the treatments, with megalopae fed live Artemia or MBD containing 0.20%, 0.40% or 0.80% total cholesterol showing relative shorter development time to C1; between 8.0 (&#177; 1.46) days and 9.9 (&#177; 1.37) days, whereas the longest development time was recorded for the megalopae fed diets containing 0.14% or 1.00% total cholesterol; 11 (&#177; 1.45) days and 11 (&#177; 1.24) days, respectively. Based on these findings, 0.80% total dietary cholesterol was suggested as optimum in semi-purified diets for S. serrata megalopa.
 
 For some marine crustaceans, an interaction occurs between dietary cholesterol and dietary phospholipid. This has important implications for diet formulation, and to determine if this interaction is present in S. serrata larvae, the experiment reported in
 Chapter 5 was conducted to evaluate the effects of varying dietary levels of lecithin and cholesterol on growth, development and survival of megalopa. Six semi-purified MBD were formulated to be iso-energetic and iso-nitrogenous and to containing three levels of supplemental lecithin (0.0, 2.0 and 4.0% diet dry weight) and two levels of supplemental cholesterol (0.0 and 0.7% diet dry weight). The experiment was designed in the same manner as in Chapter 4, and the results showed a significant interaction between supplemental dietary lecithin and cholesterol for final mean dry weight of newly settled crabs. Highest survival (60%) was recorded for megalopae fed diets containing the highest levels of dietary lecithin regardless of whether diets were supplemented with cholesterol, and this rate of survival was identical to that of
 megalopae fed live Artemia nauplii. The experiment indicated that supplemental dietary cholesterol may not be essential for mud crab megalopae when fed a diet containing fish oil and sufficient levels of supplemental dietary phospholipids.
 Most crustacean diets today are formulated to contain a 2:1 fish oil/corn oil ratio based on known requirements of penaeid prawns. As the results from the previous chapters indicated that the nutritional requirements of S. serrata larvae are different from those of other marine crustaceans, the experiment in Chapter 6 was designed to examine the optimum fish oil/corn oil ratio in semi-purified diets formulated for mud crab megalopae. Six iso-energetic and iso-nitrogenous MBD containing 6% total lipid were formulated to contain fish oil and corn oil either singly or in various ratios (0:1, 1:2, 2:1, 3:1, 1:0, 1:1), and each dietary treatment consisted of 20 individually reared megalopae. Survival, growth, development time to C1 and signs of molting death syndrome (MDS) were recorded daily, and carapace width and dry weight of newly molted crabs were measured immediately after molt. Megalopae from all dietary treatments successfully molted to C1; however, best survival (70%) was achieved by megalopae fed MBD containing a fish oil/corn oil ratio of 1:1. Megalopae fed MBD containing ratios of  3:1and 1:0 showed survival of 65%, while survival of megalopae fed either live Artemia nauplii or MBD containing a fish oil/corn oil ratio of 2:1 was 60%. Lower survival (55% and 35%) was recorded for megalopae fed MBD with ratios of 1:2 and 0:1, respectively. Significantly greater mean carapace width (3.51 &#177; 0.03 mm) and significantly higher mean dry weight (2.14 &#177; 0.14 mg) was recorded for crabs molting from megalopae fed live Artemia nauplii compared to those resulting from megalopae fed MBD. Results from this experiment indicate that the optimal fish oil/corn oil ratio is around 1:1 when oil is supplied at a level of 6% of total diet dry weight. The study further showed that complete replacement of fish oil with corn oil in the formulated diet resulted in a high occurrence of MDS-related mortality, indicating an essential dietary requirement for &gt;C18 highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA), and a link between n-3 HUFA availability and the occurrence of MDS.
 In nature the nutritional requirements of crab larvae are satisfied by the diversity and variability of natural prey and their broad nutrient contents. As the study of larvae in the wild is practically impossible, analysis of the biochemical changes occurring in the tissue during larval development in the laboratory has been used as an alternative method for elucidating information on the nutritional requirements of larvae. These principles have been applied successfully to studies of several crustaceans, but a complete record of changes in lipid and fatty acid profile during ontogenetic development of mud crabs was not available. Comprehensive analysis of changes in dry weight, organic content, total lipid, lipid class and fatty acid composition in developing S. serrata larvae reared under standard hatchery conditions is reported in Chapter 7. An increase in mean dry weight (DW) was observed during larval development, from 12.11 &#177; 0.31 &#956;g for newly hatched zoea I, to 1025.52 &#177; 87.11 &#956;g for newly molted megalopae.
 
 The organic content of larvae ranged between 58.18 &#177; 2.37% (zoea I) and 70.16 &#177;
 0.68% (zoea III) of sample DW, and statistical analysis indicated significant differences in the percentage organic content between the larval stages. On this basis the results relating to fatty acid composition of larvae were presented on a per unit ash free dry weight (AFDW) basis. The total fatty acid content of larval tissues increased from 22.89 &#177; 3.72 &#956;g mg-1 AFDW in newly hatched zoea I larvae, peaking at 31.38 &#177; 18.30 &#956;g mg-1 AFDW at zoea V before dropping down to 24.92 &#177; 13.56 &#956;g mg-1 AFDW at the megalopa stage. During the first zoea stage, saturated fatty acids (SFA) and highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA), dominated the fatty acid profile, while
 monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) were less abundant. As the larval developed the
 HUFA were depleted, while an increase in MUFA was recorded during the zoea V and megalopa stages, suggesting that HUFA requirements go down during the later part of larval development. The fatty acid composition was relatively stable throughout larval development, dominated by palmitic acid (16:0), stearic acid (18:0), oleic acid (18:1n- 9), arachidonic acid (20:4-n-6, AA), eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3, EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3, DHA). A substantial increase in linolenic acid (18:3n-3, LNA) levels was recorded in zoea V larvae, a result probably linked to the elevated LNA content in enriched Artemia meta-nauplii used as food for later stage larvae.
 
 When subjected to starvation, crustaceans go through distinct phases of biomass degradation. This process is useful for identification of key fatty acids, and Chapter 8 reports on the changes in lipid and fatty acid metabolism observed in zoea V and
 megalopa subjected to feeding and starvation, respectively. The objective was to gain a better understanding of fatty acid utilization, and to identify possible changes in lipid requirements during the two last larval stages, which again may be linked to the high incidence of MDS during these larvae stages in mud crab hatcheries. Larvae were reared following established hatchery protocols, and newly molted zoea V and megalopae were subject to 4 days of feeding or starvation, and larval tissue was sampled for lipid analysis. An additional 6 day starvation treatment was incorporated for the megalopa stage as a response to the longer duration of this larval stage compared to the zoea stages. The results showed that fatty acids had an important role as an energy store in starved larvae, and the fatty acid content of larval tissue was reduced by 71.93% and 72.96% for zoea V and megalopa, respectively, during the 4 day starvation period.
 
 Further depletion of stored fatty acids was not, however, observed when megalopae were starved for another 2 days, indicating that other nutrient sources are utilized for energy when larvae are subject to prolonged starvation. Fatty acids from the polar lipid fraction dominated larval tissue, while fatty acids from the neutral lipid fraction were preferentially metabolized for energy during food deprivation. Depletion of both SFA, MUFA and HUFA was observed among unfed larvae, and in accordance with the findings in the previous chapter, depletion of EPA, DHA and AA indicated a possible decreasing requirement of these fatty acids during later larval development. Fed larvae, on the other hand, maintained more stable fatty acid levels, and they were able to sequester a range of fatty acids from live Artemia. Comparison of the lipid profile of starved and fed larvae highlights an inability for de novo synthesis of both C18 fatty acids such as LNA, and HUFA like DHA, EPA and AA.
 
 This project utilised integrated methodology to study lipid requirements of mud crab larvae. Growth trials were the most optimal way of specifying nutritional requirement, while biochemical analysis was used to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms behind growth promotion. The findings have significantly enhanced our current understanding of dietary lipid requirements and utilization in mud crab larvae, which will have significant implications for the development of a nutritionally appropriate MBD for S. serrata larval culture in the future.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2150/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2150/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The neural correlates of the jitter illusion</field><field name="creator">Brooks, Anna</field><field name="description">The work that follows introduces a new visual illusion. The &#8216;jitter&#8217; illusion arises in response to single brief presentations of stationary Glass patterns composed of decrement- and increment-defined dot-pairs. Remarkably, the perceptions that arise are of coherent global motion in trajectories that are consistent with the spatial configuration of the Glass patterns; patterns configured according to concentric functions give rise to perceptions of motion in concentric trajectories, those configured according to radial functions give rise to perceptions of motion in radial trajectories, and so on. The aim of the work that follows was to develop a model of the neural correlates of this illusion. An additional aim was to explore the implications of such a model for developing a broader understanding of the means by which coherent visual perceptions arise. Experiments were conducted under the working hypothesis that the jitter illusion is mediated by activity that arises within the magno-cellular (M-), and not the parvo-cellular (P-) pathway of the visual system. It is argued that a model based entirely on M-pathway activity can effectively account for the illusion if two critical conditions are met. The first is that the model must propose the mechanism by which presentations of stationary Glass patterns stimulate activity in the motion-sensitive cells of the M-pathway. The second is that it must propose plausible mechanism(s) by which the ensuing M-pathway activity gives rise to perceptions of coherent global motion. Experiments reported in chapters 3 and 4 address the first of these conditions. Data from these experiments suggest that abrupt changes in luminance introduced at the onset and offset of stationary Glass patterns (and not eye-movements) mediate the M-pathway activity on which the illusion is based. Experiments reported in chapters 5 through to 8 address the second condition. In chapters 5 and 6, the data suggest that the patterns of Off- and On-channel responses elicited by individual Glass pattern dot-pairs somehow stimulates cells that act as &#8216;local&#8217; motion detectors. In chapters 7 and 8, models of the means by this occurs were tested. The resulting data rule out the possibility that the stimulation is a product of a processing asynchrony in the M-pathway Off- and On-channels. Instead, they are consistent with a model based on the diphasic temporal impulse-response functions attributed to cells that make up the M-pathway. Based on its ability to satisfy each of the stated conditions, the so-called diphasic TIRF model is presented as a plausible account of some of the neural correlates of the jitter illusion. The implications of the diphasic TIRF model are discussed in relation to both the jitter illusion and to visual processing more generally. One of the critical (and novel) implications of the model is that under some circumstances, M-pathway mechanisms &#8216;extract&#8217; structural information from static visual images that P-pathway mechanisms cannot. On this basis, it is argued that both the jitter illusion and the diphasic TIRF model offer valuable insights into some of the means by which light-induced activity within the human visual system gives rise to coherent global perceptions.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1034/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1034/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of podovirus-like bacteriophage in the virulence of Vibrio harveyi strain 47666-1</field><field name="creator">Busico-Salcedo, Nancy</field><field name="description">Two studies were conducted to demonstrate the transfer of virulence between the strains infected with phage VHPL and the same strains uninfected with the phage.
 The first study was to determine if a bacteriophage isolated from the more virulent strain (47666-1) would show the same virulence effects as bacteriophage VHML. The second study was to develop polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies specific to the toxic protein subunits of V. harveyi 47666-1. These antibodies were then used to detect this specific exotoxin from the previously na&#239;ve strains of V. harveyi infected with the phage VHPL.
 SDS-PAGE analysis showed an up regulation and production of extracellular proteins in previously na&#239;ve V. harveyi strains receiving this phage compared with uninfected strains. Haemolysin assays indicated a significant increase (P&lt;0.001) in both halo of clearing and colony diameter in bacteriophage-infected strains of V. harveyi compared to the same individual strains uninfected with the phage. However, siderophore production was not significant as all of the inducible strains did not respond positively on Chrome Azurol-S (CAS) agar. Chitin degradation, on the other hand, resulted in significantly greater zones of clearing (P&lt;0.001) in strains infected with bacteriophage from V. harveyi 47666-1 than the same strains receiving no phage. In bath challenge assay, the results indicated that as a group, there was a significant difference in mortality rate among strains infected with bacteriophage from V. harveyi 47666-1 (F=82.824, DF=9,40, P&lt;0.001) than strains of V. harveyi without the bacteriophage.
 Polyclonal (PAbs) and monoclonal (MAbs) antibodies to the specific toxic subunits 45 and 55 kDa of V. harveyi 47666-1 were produced and used to detect specific toxic subunits from previously na&#239;ve strains of V. harveyi challenged with the phage. In western blot assay, PAbs produced only one specific toxin subunit having molecular weight of approximately 55kD in strains 30, 12 and 20 while no bands where obtained from strain 643. Two MAbs (3A1-9 and 5A2-1) were characterised and both detected toxic protein subunits in all na&#239;ve strains of V. harveyi infected with the phage. However, cross reactions were observed in na&#239;ve strains 30, 12 and 20 uninfected with the phage.
 In conclusion, the presence of bacteriophage VHPL from V. harveyi 47666-1 probably enhanced the virulence using assays with four na&#239;ve strains of V. harveyi as a model. There was significant up-regulation of proteins based on SDS-PAGE, up-regulation of haemolysins, chitinases and greater mortality to larvae of P. monodon. It is therefore suggested that the presence of this bacteriophage may either partly or fully confers virulence to V. harveyi strain 47666-1.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1039/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1039/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">North of the Cape and south of the Fly: the archaeology of settlement and subsistence on the Murray Islands, Eastern Torres Strait</field><field name="creator">Carter, Melissa Jane</field><field name="description">This dissertation describes analyses and contextualises the results of archaeological investigations carried out between 1998 and 2000 on Mer and Dauar in Torres Strait. Along with Waier these small volcanic islands are commonly known as the Murray Islands, and form the most eastern group of the formation of islands scattered between northeastern Australia and southern Papua New Guinea. Unlike the research into human occupation and subsistence in Australia and New Guinea, the archaeology of the Torres Strait Islands is by contrast a relatively recent academic pursuit. Over the last 30 years various researchers have postulated the timing of first human occupation of Torres Strait, the development of maritime and horticultural subsistence systems and the emergence of ethnohistorically documented trade networks. A lack of archaeological data, however, has prevented informed consideration of these issues. This dissertation presents the results of the first systematic archaeological excavations undertaken in the Eastern Torres Strait, and includes the first detailed radiocarbon chronological sequence for the Murray Islands and for the Torres Strait more generally. The excavations on Dauar revealed extensive archaeological deposits of marine subsistence remains, and previously unrecorded material culture of Torres Strait; most notably, several sherds of earthenware pottery. These artefacts have provided new opportunities for investigating the traditional trade and exchange networks between the Torres Strait Islands and New Guinea that existed at the time of European contact. The Murray Islands data illustrates the existence of a maritime subsistence base from the time of first human occupation now securely dated to almost 3000 years BP. Although plant macrofossils where absent during the excavations, evidence for horticultural subsistence on Dauar was identified through the extraction and identification of plant phytoliths and starch grains from excavated sediment samples. In combination with the radiocarbon site chronologies and changes to sediment deposition rates and assemblage densities, it is concluded that these results indicate the onset of widespread clearance and horticultural activities on the island from at least 2000 years BP, providing the earliest date for the emergence of horticulture so far established in Torres Strait. Dated to between 2000 and 700 years BP, the excavated pottery from Dauar suggests the possibility of sustained linkages between the peoples of the Eastern Torres Strait and New Guinea. Ethnohistoric records suggest southward trade into the Eastern Torres Strait was dominated by southwestern coastal Papuan communities, and particularly by groups of the Fly Estuary. Surprisingly, mineralogical analysis of selected pottery sherds from the Murray Islands revealed the presence of sand tempers sourced to the metamorphic and volcanic lithology of the Eastern New Guinea Highlands. More accurately, these results are concluded to portray linkages between the Torres Strait and the adjacent southern Papuan lowlands through which more discrete movements and transactions with interior areas occurred along key riverways that connected the hinterland to the coast. The timing of human occupation of Torres Strait, the development of subsistence systems and the relationships that islanders had with the peoples of northern Australia and the western Pacific have only started to be explored archaeologically. It is concluded from the combined ethnohistorical and field archaeological evidence that settlement and subsistence in Torres Strait is a product of late-Holocene human expansions and cultural intensification previously documented for the adjacent mainlands and the broader western Pacific region. This research confirms that the archaeology of Torres Strait must be interpreted within the broader cultural, chronological and geographical context in which it is centrally located.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1054/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1054/2/02chapters1-4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1054/3/03chapter5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1054/4/04chapter6-10.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1054/5/05references.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1054/6/06appendices.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Herbivorous fishes as determinants of the structure of coral reef communities: farmers, foragers and their interactions</field><field name="creator">Ceccarelli, Daniela Monica</field><field name="description">Herbivorous fish are considered integral to the maintenance of healthy coral reef ecosystems. However, the impacts of different kinds of herbivorous fishes on algal and coral assemblages, and the consequences of interactions among them, have not been fully assessed. Two groups of fish with very different feeding behaviours and potential impacts on benthic communities are the territorial herbivores, (primarily damselfish; termed &#8216;farmers&#8217; throughout this thesis), and the more mobile, often schooling herbivores, (primarily parrotfish and surgeonfish; termed &#8216;foragers&#8217;). Although farmers have been attributed the status of keystone species on coral reefs, the importance of this group has not been sufficiently evaluated. Farmers can affect benthic communities through selective feeding, &#8216;weeding&#8217;, exclusion of foragers through aggression, and habitat selection. However, the specific mechanisms by which farmers maintain the typical algal turfs in their territories have not been isolated. The overall goal of this thesis was to assess the relative importance of farmers and foragers, and the interactions between them, in determining the structure and dynamics of benthic communities on coral reefs. The specific objectives of this thesis were to explore the role of farmers on coral reefs, to distinguish their role from that of foragers, and to experimentally distinguish among the potential mechanisms by which farmers maintain the benthic assemblages within their territories. I collected extensive observational data to assess the spatial and temporal variability in farmer effects, both within and between reefs. A comparative study allowed me to determine the effects of several farmer species with previously unknown impacts. I then used a series of experiments to determine the effects of foragers on farmers, the effects of farmers on foragers, and to separate the mechanisms by which both groups and their interactions affect benthic communities. The first chapter of this thesis introduces common generalizations about the role of farmers, and questions their validity in relation to previously existing information. In Chapter 2, I describe the spatial variability and seasonality in the effects of three farmer species on their territories on a coastal coral reef. There were distinct patterns of zonation in both farmers and benthic communities, and the effects of farmers on algal assemblages in their territories varied across reef zones. Each species in this study maintained territories with different algal assemblages, indicating that there is no general effect of farmers on algal composition. The overall benthic community was strongly seasonal, but the composition of algal assemblages in farmer territories varied in response to episodic events (cyclones, coral bleaching, etc.). These results suggest that studies on farmer effects may need to take account of the reef zone and the season in which sampling takes place. Chapter 3 establishes the effects of different farmer species on benthic communities and assesses levels of feeding selectivity as a possible mechanism for modifying algal assemblages inside territories. I compared the diets, territory composition and space occupation of ten farmer species across three geographic locations representing different reef types. Overall, farmer territories occupied between 11% and 60% of reef substrata, and between 52% and 100% of reef crest habitats, suggesting that they are likely to be important contributors to coral reef community structure. All the farmers included in these studies significantly modified the algal assemblages in their territories by promoting the abundance of preferred food items. Diets varied along a continuum from detritivory to herbivory, and both the distribution of farmers on the reef and the benthic composition of their territories reflected the proportions of algae and detritus in their diets. This suggests that diet can give a strong indication to the likely nature and magnitude of farmer effects on their territories. The differences among species make it overly simplistic to consider them a single ecological grouping, but their space occupation as a community, and consequently the spatial extent of their influence, has previously been underestimated. In Chapter 4, I explored the effects of foragers on farmers, their territory sizes and the benthic communities in their territories. A forager exclusion experiment showed that foragers had a major impact on the dynamics of two abundant farmers (Pomacentrus adelus and P. wardi), and altered their relative abundance in favour of the larger species, P. wardi. Territory size was enlarged only briefly when foragers were absent, but the results suggest that foragers can hinder the ability of some farmers to maintain optimal quantity and quality of food algae in their territories. Foragers were previously only thought to affect farmers through the energetic cost of territory defence, but this study suggests that foragers may also determine relative densities of farmers and the composition of their territories. Chapter 5 focusses on an experiment designed to distinguish between the effects of farmers and foragers on algae and corals, and to assess the effects of forager exclusion and direct farming as mechanisms by which farmers affect benthic communities. The experiment was conducted on an oligotrophic reef in Papua New Guinea and is based on an orthogonal combination of a farmer removal treatment and a forager exclusion treatment. It showed that foragers had quantitatively greater and qualitatively different effects on benthic community structure than farmers. Where foragers were excluded, there were substantial increases in the cover and biomass of macro-algae and a decline in some corals, regardless of the presence of farmers. Where farmers were removed there was a moderate decline in the cover of some palatable algal species, regardless of whether foragers had access. No effect of the exclusion of foragers by farmers could be detected, providing the first experimental evidence that direct farming activities can be more important than forager exclusion in the promotion of distinct algal turfs in farmer territories. In Chapter 6, the separate effects of foragers and farmers on algal succession, and their interactions, were tested on an inshore reef with high macroalgal cover. Grazing by foragers, farmer activities, and the a priori differences in the location of territories had different effects on algal succession on settlement tiles. Benthic communities developed differently where foragers were excluded by farmers, compared with where they were excluded by cages. Foragers did not suppress fleshy macroalgae, but inhibited succession to exclude calcified and crustose algae. Farmers had more dramatic effects on succession than foragers on this reef, suppressing macroalgae and promoting dense stands of palatable filamentous algae. The results suggest that territories were established in locations less suitable to the growth of fleshy macroalgae, and were subsequently &#8220;cultivated&#8221; by farmers. This study provides further evidence of the importance of farming as a mechanism for modifying benthic communities, and challenges the notion that foragers have stronger effects than farmers on all reef types. In summary, not all farmers have the same dramatic effects on benthic communities as those emphasized in the literature. However, more species than previously thought have significant effects on their territories, suggesting that the spatial extent to which farmers influence coral reef communities may be greater than expected. The interactions between foragers and farmers are complex, and can have consequences not only for farmer population densities, but also for the quantity and food quality of algal turfs in farmer territories. It is becoming increasingly evident that the effects of farmers are not always limited to the aggressive exclusion of foragers, and that the relative importance of foragers and farmers may vary on different reef types. Both foragers and farmers play important roles in the maintenance of the existing benthic structure of coral reefs, and it seems likely that the loss of either group could lead to significant shifts in coral reef community composition.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1067/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1067/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural and metamorphic evolution of the Robertson River metamorphics with pressure-temperature-deformation-time (P-T-D-t) path</field><field name="creator">Cihan, Mustafa</field><field name="description">SECTION A.  Understanding the relationships of inclusion trail geometries in porphyroblasts relative to matrix foliations is vital for unravelling complex deformation and metamorphic histories in highly tectonized terranes and the approach used to thin sectioning rocks is critically important for this. Two approaches have been used by structural and metamorphic geologists. One is based on fabric orientations with sections cut perpendicular to the foliation both parallel (P) and normal (N) to the lineation, whereas the other uses geographic orientations and a series of vertical thin sections. Studies using P and N sections reveal a simple history in comparison with studies using multiple-vertical thin sections. The reason for this is that inclusion trails exiting the porphyroblasts into the strain shadows in P and N sections commonly appear continuous with the matrix foliation whereas multiple vertical thin sections with different strikes reveal that they are actually truncated. Such truncations or textural unconformities are apparent from microstructures, textural relationships, compositional variations and FIA (Foliation Intersection Axis) trends. A succession of four FIA trends from ENE-WSW, E-W, N-S to NE-SW in the Robertson River Metamorphics, northern Queensland, Australia, suggests that these truncations were formed because of the overprint of successive generations of orthogonal foliations preserved within porphyroblasts from growth during multiple deformation events. At least four periods involving multiple phases of porphyroblast growth can be delineated instead of just the one previously suggested from an N and P section approach.  SECTION B.  A succession of four foliation intersection/inflection axes preserved in porphyroblasts (FIAs) trending ENE-WSW, E-W, N-S and NE-SW has been distinguished in the Proterozoic Robertson River Metamorphics (Georgetown Inlier, Queensland, Australia) based upon relative timing plus inclusion texture and orientation. The successions of asymmetries of inclusion trails defining these FIAs document the geometry of deformation associated with folding and fabric development during discreet episodes of bulk shortening. The successions of asymmetries bear no relationship to the geometry of macroscale folds present in the area suggesting that these folds predate porphyroblast growth, the widespread metamorphism and matrix fabric development. The onset of regional macro-scale folding may have begun soon after the deposition at around 1655 Ma in Georgetown Inlier. These folds were then amplified, overturned and refolded during NNWSSE, N-S, E-W and NW-SE regional bulk shortening. Earlier deformations were erased from the matrix because of bedding-induced shearing (reactivation) on the limbs of pre-existing macro-scale folds. Four foliations, S1 to S4, identified in the matrix provided information about the youngest deformations preserved in these rocks.  SECTION C.  Contouring XMn, XFe and XCa for garnet porphyroblasts and XAn for plagioclase inclusions in the MnNCKFMASH system provides an estimation of the P-T variation during the growth history of these porphyroblasts. Integration of this approach with relative timing constraints obtained from successions of Foliation Intersection/Inflection Axes within porphyroblasts (FIAs) reveals a more extensive P-T-D history than previously recognised in the Robertson River Metamorphics, Georgetown Inlier (NE Australia). A succession of four FIA trends (ENE-WSW, E-W, N-S, NE-SW) reveals three extended periods of garnet porphyroblast growth and two of staurolite growth in this region. Chemically zoned garnet porphyroblasts were selected based on successively formed FIAs in their cores from four representative rock samples. The intersection of XMn, XFe and XCa isopleths for the cores of the successively generated garnet porphyroblasts plus that of XCa and XAn isopleths for garnet and plagioclase inclusions suggests that pressures progressively increased from 3.2 to 5.8 kb and at temperatures from 530&#186; to 560&#186; C. This accompanied an orogenic progression from NNWSSE (O1), N-S (O2) to E-W (O3) shortening. The maximum pressures and temperatures achieved, around 6-7 kb at 590&#186;-610&#186; C, were followed by decompression and retrograde metamorphism with andalusite replacing an early formed generation of staurolite. These rocks were overprinted by NW SE shortening (O4) occurring synchronously with low pressure &#8211; high temperature metamorphism, resulting in the overprint of early minerals by sillimanite and prograde muscovite. This last event was attributed to widespread granitic intrusion in all NE Australian Craton at around 1550 Ma.  SECTION D.  Electron microprobe dating of monazite confirms the relative timing of a succession of Foliation Intersection Axis trends in porphyroblasts (FIAs) and two extended periods of metamorphism, revealing a lengthy history of orogenesis in the Robertson River Metamorphics (NE Australia). A complete pressure-temperature-deformation-time (P-T-D-t) path has been deciphered involving an early clockwise P-T loop (not previously recognized in the NE Australian Craton) followed by an anticlockwise P-T trajectory. Metamorphism continued episodically throughout orogenesis changing from medium pressures and temperatures to lower pressures and higher temperatures after an intervening retrogressive phase. Successive generations of fine-grained monazite (5&#956;m-20&#956;m) were identified using microstructure and FIA trends and then dated. The succession of four FIAs trending ENE-WSW (FIA1), E-W (FIA2), N-S (FIA3), NE-SW (FIA4) plus four matrix structures, S1-S4 reveal three periods of garnet and two of staurolite growth, and suggest that monazite grains were episodically grown, dissolved and regrown due to successive periods of foliation development or reactivation. Isopleth thermobarometery, using P-T pseudosections in the MnNCKFMASH system for garnet porphyroblasts selected based on FIA trends in their core, reveal that the pressure increased progressively from 3- 4kb at 530&#186;-550&#186;C to 6-7kb at 600&#186;-620&#186;C during medium pressure temperature metamorphism. This was accompanied by changing bulk shortening directions from NNW-SSE to N-S to E-W (perpendicular to FIAs 1,2 and 3). The development of FIA1 and FIA2 occurred between ca.1655 (depositional age) and 1592 Ma. FIA3 developed over a 30 Ma period from 1592 Ma to 1559 Ma. Retrogressive metamorphism, decompression and exhumation occurred over a 10 Ma period. Further metamorphism accompanied regional granite intrusion around ca. 1550 Ma and generated lower pressure - higher temperature metamorphism during the development of FIA4 (NW-SE bulk shortening). This period of orogenesis possibly extended for another 30-50 Ma based on the ages obtained from the youngest foliations in the matrix. Correlation of these data with other NE Australian Proterozoic Inliers suggests that they were all once part of a single orogen that developed from 1655 to 1500 Ma.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1069/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1069/2/02sectionsA-Dtext.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1069/3/03sectionAfiguresandtables.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1069/4/04sectionBfigures_and_tables.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1069/5/05sectionCfiguresandtables.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1069/6/06sectionDfiguresandtables.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1069/7/07appendices.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of protein complexes involved in the adenylation cascade of the nitrogen signalling pathway in Escherichia coli.</field><field name="creator">Clancy, Paula</field><field name="description">Adenylyl transferase (ATase), the glnE gene product from Escherichia coli, is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyses the opposing adenylylation and deadenylylation of glutamine synthetase (GS). The overall aim of this thesis was elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of the adenylylation cascade. A new central domain has been identified using ATase truncation constructs in activity assays and solubility trials. This new regulatory domain is flanked by two flexible Qlinkers, Q1 and Q2. Thus the topology of ATase can be represented as N-Q1-R-Q2-C. The N domain was PII-UMP independent in in vitro deadenylylation assays, and had 1000 fold less activity then entire ATase, suggesting PII-UMP binding impacts on the conformation of the deadenylylation active site. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) generated in this work against ATase were characterised using ATase mutants and the truncated proteins. Two mAbs, 5A7 (binds residues 502- 548) and 39G11 (binds residues 466-501) both binding in the R domain, blocked the binding of PII, GlnK, PII-UMP and GlnK-UMP to ATase. This is the first report that pinpoints the effector-protein binding sites to within the R domain of ATase. Both PII and ATase bound &#945;-ketoglutarate (&#945;-kg) in direct binding assays. Several lines of evidence suggested that PII contains the high affinity &#945;-kg binding site and ATase the low affinity site. This study demonstrates for the first time that the two small effector-molecules &#945;-kg and glutamine (gln) probably bind in the last 340 residues of ATase (Q2-C domain), possibly near the adenylylation active site. The demonstration that the ATase mutant W694G presented a gln independent phenotype suggests that the bulky side chain of Trp 694 must move out of the adenylylation active site, so that GS can dock and be modified. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) data suggested the binding of gln within Q2-C is transmitted to the R domain as an allosteric inhibitor of PII-UMP binding, and consequently deadenylylation. A panel of mAbs was also produced against PII and characterised using a series of PII mutants. Two of the PII mAbs 19G4 (binds PII/GlnK) and 24H2 (binds PII) were used further to demonstrate that heterotrimers are formed between PII and GlnK in vivo in nitrogen starved cells. It is well documented that the T-loops of PII and GlnK are probably the principal regions used by these signalling proteins to bind to the various receptor-proteins such as ATase, UTase and NRII. This study suggests PII and GlnK also interact with GS. Using PII mutants carrying specific GlnK residues at positions 43, 52 and 54 in the T-loop this study demonstrated the Asp at position 54 was the critical determinant of PII T-loop binding to GS, whereas the interaction with UTase involved both Asp54 and Thr43.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1082/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1082/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecological role of sea hares (Opisthobranchia: Anaspidea) within tropical intertidal habitats</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Cathryn Lynne</field><field name="description">Herbivory in temperate marine ecosystems has been the focus of widespread research attention. In comparison, little is known about tropical herbivores and the role they play in controlling the abundance of marine macrophytes. This study investigates the role of one group of invertebrate herbivores, the sea hares. Their role as herbivores in tropical intertidal habitats was examined at four study sites situated near Townsville, Queensland, Australia. The roles these animals play as herbivores were investigated by examining the variation in density and feeding specificity.
 The variation in density was documented by surveying the distribution and abundance of sea hares and their food macrophytes for one year. In addition, the population dynamics of population irruptions of sea hares at a single site were examined in greater detail. There was extreme variation in the densities reached by each of the five local species recorded. Aplysia dactylomela, Aplysia extraordinaria, and Petalifera petalifera remained at low abundance throughout the sampling period. In contrast, Bursatella leachii and Stylocheilus striatus were found in extremely high density within the seagrass beds of Shelly Beach in association with a bloom of the cyanobacteria Calothrix crustacea. The population dynamics of Bursatella leachii showed that at this location, the population underwent continuous recruitment in contrast to the results of previous studies.
 The relationships between each sea hare species and their preferred host macrophytes were species specific. The density of Aplysia dactylomela was positively correlated with a limited number of red algae species, but the clearest relationship was with the red macrophytic group (Rhodophyta), a finding consistent with previous feeding preferences experiments for this species. Aplysia extraordinaria density was correlated with several of the available red algae species however because of the low density, its feeding ecology remains unclear. Petalifera petalifera was found to maintain a very strict association with the brown calcified alga, Padina tenuis. The temporal distribution of all sea hares was restricted to the winter months, a relationship that may be related to environmental limitations, such as ultraviolet radiation. The abundances of B. leachii and S. striatus could not be quantitatively related to any of the algal species recorded because cyanobacteria bloom abundance was not estimated. The feeding specificity of Bursatella leachii was more closely examined using two-way choice preference testing. This species preferred to consume the green alga, Enteromorpha sp. to the cyanobacterium Calothrix crustacea, the brown alga Sargassum sp., and the red alga Pterocladia pinnata. There was no difference in the feeding hierarchy obtained by examining edibility or attractiveness. Feeding specificity of the six local sea hares was also investigated by examining the morphology of the radula feeding organ. Scanning electron microscopy was used to examine the fine details of the radula teeth. Three radula teeth types were created based on the sea hare radulae examined: simple, bilobed and denticulate. These radula types correspond to the feeding preferences exhibited by each sea hare. Sea hares with complex radulae were more likely to be highly specialised feeders while those with simple radulae were more likely to be generalists. A theoretical framework was developed, based on these radula types, which can now be used to make testable predictions about feeding preferences of sea hare species with unknown feeding specificity.
 The results of this study demonstrate that the density and feeding specificity of sea hares are species specific. Therefore care should be taken in extrapolating information from studies based on a small number of sea hare species to the entire sea hare group. Three of the sea hare species examined within (A. dactylomela, A. extraordinaria and P. petalifera) are not likely to play major roles as herbivores in their habitats as a result of their low densities. However, Bursatella leachii and Stylocheilus striatus would exert a strong influence on their seagrass habitats as a because of their high density and feeding specialisation on cyanobacteria. Sea hares may play an increased role in habitats, such as shallow intertidal ecosystems, unavailable to the primary herbivores.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1083/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1083/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interactions between dugongs and seagrasses in a subtropical environment</field><field name="creator">Preen, A. R.</field><field name="description">This study investigated the ecology of dugongs in Moreton Bay, a 1400 km2 embayment in sub-tropical south-east Queensland (27.5" S, 153.3" E). The dugongs' distribution, movements, home range, habitat selection, feeding, diet and food preferences were examined in relation to the seagrass and physical resources. I considered the ways in which dugongs affect the seagrasses and the significance of the dugongs' role in the seagrass system. Seagrasses were quantitatively mapped in two study areas, encompassing 133 krn2 of seagrass. Seven species of seagrass formed 15 recognised communities, which collapsed into five community-groups. Communities dominated by species of Halophila were the most widespread, covering 51 % of the total area of seagrass, but they were characterised by low biomass, and accounted for only 9% of the total standing crop of seagrass (total = 12,808 tonnes dry weight). In comparison, communities dominated by Zostera capricorni (broad-leaf morph) occupied only 38% of the area of seagrass, but contained 75% of the seagrass standing crop. The annual, above-ground production of seagrass within the study areas was estimated to be 41,728 tonnes dry weight. Zostera capricorni, the dominant species in terms of biomass (57.5% of total above-ground standing crop), accounted for 34% of the total, while the species of Halophila accounted for 36.6 % , despite representing only 20.5 % of above-ground standing crop. The distinct seasonality of Moreton Bay was highly correlated with pronounced changes in seagrass abundance. There was a distinct summer/autumn peak in the abundance of most species. Zostera capricorni alone had a winterlspring growth period. Averaged across all species, shoot density, above-ground and belowground biomass changed by factors of 1.9, 2.3 and 2.3, respectively, between seasons of minimum and maximum abundance. Based on 28 aerial surveys, I estimate a Moreton Bay population of 600 dugongs. During spring and summer the dugongs were relatively sedentary, however, during winter the dugongs undertook regular migrations between the feeding areas inside the Bay and the oceanic waters east of the Bay (15-40 km round-trip). By riding the flood and ebb tides in and out of the Bay, the dugongs could exploit the temperature differential of up to 5" C between areas. Sometimes they spent as little as 1.5 hr, during the top of the tide, feeding in the Bay. Some dugongs stayed in the warm water outside the Bay for days at a time in winter. Thirteen dugongs occupied an average range of 64 km2 during the periods they were satellite-tracked (mean = 50 days). Within their home range, some dugongs sequentially used distinct sub-ranges, in which they concentrated their activities for periods of up to 35 days.

All fieldwork was conducted on the inshore reefs of Kimbe Bay, New Britain, Papua New Guinea (5o30&#8217;S 150o6&#8217;E). Spawning aggregations of reef fish were located by intensively searching areas of reef on snorkel at all times of the day from before dawn to after dusk. After &gt;2,000hours of observations made between June 2001 to May 2004, 37 species from 6 families were observed forming spawning aggregations at 38 sites spread over 7 reefs. All species were relatively large (none &lt;10cm max T.L.) and all but one species spawned pelagically. There was no relationship between a species&#8217; population density and whether it formed spawning aggregations, nor was spawning aggregation formation itself a density dependent phenomenon, with aggregations ranging in size from 3 to 2000 individuals. Most spawning aggregation sites were used by multiple species, with a maximum of 27 species spawning aggregatively at one site of &lt;10x10m. A selection of spawning aggregation sites were monitored on 3 reefs in order to establish the periodicities with which different species spawned. Of the 13 species for which such periodicities could be established, spawning occurred year round, and all but one species spawned during all 4 lunar quarters. Spawning occurred more often during high tides, but no species spawned predictably more often during either ebb or flood tides. Aggregative spawning was seen at times ranging from dawn (05:45hrs) to dusk (18:00hrs). However, each species had a fixed diel interval during which it spawned. For all species this interval spanned no more than 6 hours, but for most it was less than 2. For the one species with enough data for analysis, Ctenochaetus striatus, this diel spawning interval differed significantly between sites within reefs. The physical and biotic characteristics found at spawning aggregation sites of Ctenochaetus striatus were compared to those found at alternative sites. Within spawning aggregation sites, characteristics that varied temporally were compared between times of spawning and times of no spawning. It was predicted that spawning aggregations would be formed at sites and times with characteristics that limited predation on both spawning adults and their pelagically spawned eggs. Characteristics predicted to reduce predation on eggs included: seaward projecting margins of reef, steep slopes, currents flowing rapidly off-reef (as measured by purpose-built devices), and low densities of planktivores. Characteristics predicted to reduce predation on adults included: topographically complex substratum with a large number of holes providing refuge from predators, and low densities of piscivorous fish. The only physical feature consistently distinguishing spawning aggregation sites from alternative locations was that they were found on margins of reef that projected seawards, rather than flatter or concave margins. However, many seaward projections were not used as spawning aggregation sites, and any potential anti-predatory benefit from this feature was likely to be outweighed by: (1) the greater biomasses of planktivores found at spawning aggregation sites, (2) the frequently observed predation on recently spawned eggs, and (3) certain species of egg predator being attracted to spawning aggregation sites at times of spawning. Spawning aggregations were not formed at distinctive sites with regard to current speed or direction, and there was no difference between the currents at times of aggregative spawning and those at other times within sites. Individuals&#8217; patterns of migration from home ranges to spawning aggregations were documented following an extensive tagging program of Ctenochaetus striatus. Tagged individuals were consistently resighted within limited home ranges (max. diameter averaging &lt;13m). Tagged individuals were seen in spawning aggregations on a total of 549 occasions at 13 sites on 3 reefs. The maximum distance migrated was 291m. No tagged individuals were witnessed spawning at more than one site. Most resighted individuals migrated to the spawning aggregation site that was closest to their home range. However, the few individuals that migrated to sites further away always spawned at sites where the spawning aggregation was larger than that found closest to their home range. Neither the size nor the sex of individuals limited migration distance. However, males migrated more frequently than females, and larger females migrated more frequently than smaller ones. Migration distance did not affect the frequency with which individuals spawned. The notion that spawning aggregations are formed at intrinsically beneficial sites and times is not supported by the results of this study. Strong theoretical arguments are proposed that question the mechanisms by which such adaptation could arise. It is concluded that the sites and times of spawning aggregation formation in Ctenochaetus striatus in Kimbe Bay are not adaptive beyond their clarity as cues that enable conspecifics from home ranges with limited or no overlap to synchronise spawning in space and time. Patterns of spawning aggregation formation and migration suggest that tradition plays a more significant role than resource assessment in determining where and when individuals spawn. The use of small species of aggregative spawners as biological models has the potential to greatly enhance understanding of spawning aggregation formation in certain species of commercially exploited reef fish.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1087/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1087/2/02chapters1-3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1087/3/03chapters4-7.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1087/4/04references.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transforming histories: the visual disclosure of contentious pasts</field><field name="creator">Gough, Julie</field><field name="description">The thesis and exegesis examines the potential of visual art to provide fresh forms of engagement with historical story than the archived and the written.

This tourism sector makes use of holiday-makers who volunteer to fund and work on conservation projects around the world and aims to provide to provide sustainable alternative travel that can assist in community development, scientific research or ecological restoration. Unlike ecotourism where profit drives the operator, many volunteer tourism companies are non-profit organisations, whose aim is to allow travellers to work alongside researchers on environmentally or socially beneficial projects. Such volunteer work provides a means for direct interaction between environmental scientists and the general public and is a potentially powerful tool for creating an increasingly global environmental ethic. Previous studies of volunteer tourism suggest that participants share similar characteristics to (extreme) ecotourists, i.e. tourists who desire a high level of interaction with the environment, to be environmentally responsible and to be challenged, but unlike ecotourists, volunteer tourists are believed to be motivated by a sense of altruism. Researchers describe the volunteer tourism experience as a form of serious leisure, with a focus on learning and contributing to a worthwhile cause. Other motivations that have been associated with volunteer tourism, volunteering and tourism include escape, relaxation, relationship enhancement, self-development, building a personal power base, advancing a personal agenda, developing a career that leads to status or other rewards, interest in the subject matter, and an interest in helping the researcher. How ubiquitous these motivations are and how they shape the volunteer tourism experience is not yet understood. This research investigated the volunteer tourists&#8217; expectations and experiences in order to enhance volunteer tourism&#8217;s potential as a conservation tool. It sought to identify key variables and factors which shape this sector; and to prepare the way for subsequent large scale empirical studies. It applied new data collection tools (a daily diary) to a new field of tourism research (the volunteer tourism experience) The research aims were (i) to identify differences between organisational images that might lead to different volunteer tourist experiences (Study One), (ii) to determine the socio-demographic and motivational profiles of volunteer tourists (Study Two), (iii) to examine volunteer tourists&#8217; experiences and to identify patterns of experience and the elements that lead to a satisfying experience (Study Three), and finally (iv) to understand the experience from the expedition staff&#8217;s point of view (Study Four). Study One looked at a sample of volunteer tourism organisations (n=29) to identify their projected and perceived organisational images. The former were investigated by assessing promotional photographs, mission statements and volunteer tourist testimonies, and the latter were analysed using a multiple sorting procedure performed by 30 postgraduate students. Based on the results, a general typology was developed resulting in four groups &#8211; &#8220;research conservation&#8221; expeditions, &#8220;holiday conservation&#8221; expeditions, &#8220;adventure holiday&#8221; expeditions and &#8220;community holiday&#8221; expeditions. The four groups could be distinguished based on their mission statements, photographs, testimonies, and sorting criteria. Study Two investigated the expectations, motivations and socio-demographic profiles of volunteer tourists. Volunteers from six organisations (n=77) were studied using a diary-based method. This relatively small sample size was due to the nature of volunteer tourism (infrequent trips with small groups in very remote locations). Distinct socio-demographic and motivational profiles were found: four organisations appeared to attract a younger market with a lower level of prior conservation involvement, less travel experience and who were motivated by personal development and experiential and recreational goals, while two organisations catered to an older market, who have a higher level of conservation involvement and travel experience and who were more motivated to learn and help the researcher. Study Three investigated volunteer tourist experiences based on the findings from the previous two studies. The positive and negative elements of their volunteer tourism experiences were investigated, along with on-site satisfaction and moods. The results indicated that whilst most of the volunteer tourists&#8217; motivations and expectations were fulfilled, their moods, satisfaction levels and overall assessment of the expedition were dependent on the presence of four elements: the opportunity for skill/knowledge development, having fun, experiencing new things, and contributing to a worthwhile project. Furthermore, certain experience patterns could be identified from the volunteer tourists&#8217; diaries; some volunteers were confident and highly involved in the expedition, some were slightly more anxious and did not become so involved in all aspects of the expedition, whilst others were primarily concerned with their own achievements, and lastly some show lower levels of involvement in the project. The final study investigated the staff&#8217;s expectations of the volunteers. Staff were asked to describe their qualifications for the job and the role they expected the volunteers to fulfil, to rate the items from Study Two that might have motivated their volunteers to join the expedition and to assess the volunteers&#8217; performance. In most cases, staff placed a greater emphasis on the volunteering and research aspects of the expedition, often to the detriment of fun and social elements. They felt their science and research experience qualified them for the job, that volunteers should be hard working and perform to the best of their ability. Overall, the research revealed that whilst volunteer tourists have poorly defined expectations of their expedition, they are generally satisfied as long as the four elements mentioned above are present during the expedition. The need for fun and new and different experiences contradict previous notions of volunteer tourism as a form of serious leisure involving altruistic motivations. Moreover, staff could be made more aware of the different roles they are to fulfil during the expedition. Methodological and conceptual contributions of this research include the development of an experience data collection tool and an integrative approach to studying volunteer tourism. The role of altruism as a motivating force was challenged, whilst the importance of having fun, contributing to a worthwhile project, learning and experiencing new and different things was highlighted. Opportunities for future research into the role of personality, staff attitudes and volunteer rewards, as well as the organisation&#8217;s evaluation of volunteer tourism as a form of recreation experience were presented. Furthermore, some of the variables that define this sector and may be useful employed in an Equity model of volunteer tourism were identified and may be used to refine the current state of knowledge regarding volunteer tourism as an exchange of services and benefits between two parties. Finally, recommendations are made to help enhance volunteer tourism&#8217;s potential as a conservation tool.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1096/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1096/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The social construction of Jenolan Caves: multiple meanings of a cave tourist site</field><field name="creator">Davidson, Penelope Anne</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the relationships and resultant meanings that people have for the place of Jenolan Caves, the most visited cave tourist site in Australia. The aim of the research project was to:
 further our understanding of the social dimensions of caves tourism in order to comment on issues and practices related to sustainability.
 The question was approached from a constructionist perspective, which assumes that the world of human perception is not real in an absolute sense but is made up and shaped by cultural and linguistic constructs; it is a constructing of knowledge about reality not constructing reality itself.
 The findings are based on interviews with staff, visitors and other people who regularly associate with the place of Jenolan Caves. The highlight, and perhaps the most exciting finding, was the rich depth of meaning that Jenolan is given by a broad range of people. Staff and visitors articulated a sense of passion, care and physical engagement.
 The obvious emotion of place reflects the embodied nature of place experience, other facets of which include the active and sensual ways we interact, and make sense of places we visit. Although sight dominates the experience the sound, touch and smell in a cave are also essential ingredients of the experience.
 It was clear that emotion is a response we have to place; emotion is also central in the construction of Jenolan as a tourism place. In particular passion and enthusiasm oscillates between visitors and staff, creating a connection between the two and becoming a central facet of Jenolan.
 Emotions relating to place are also negative and there was a clear tension for many people in close association with Jenolan between protecting place and selling or using place. Two dominant discourses that people draw on to make sense of Jenolan are stewardship and commodification, these are ways of making sense of Jenolan that have different primary goals but in practice are woven together. The tension exists as a very real, expressed frustration, disillusionment, and at times anger for those that work at Jenolan. It is time this tension is acknowledged, if for no other reason than it will inevitably have an impact on the interdependent relationships that exist between staff, visitors and others. That is, a satisfactory visitor experience is vulnerable to negative changes in staff relationship to place.
 Within the managing organisation, and across a portion of the relevant disciplines, the embodied nature of place experience and interdependence between peoples and place is not fully recognised. It is not fully articulated within the Jenolan Caves Reserve Trust, and in likelihood is not articulated in other protected area agencies. The implications of these findings for the ongoing sustainability of protected area tourist sites, such as Jenolan Caves, is that discourses and approaches are required that open the management system to the sensual, emotional, and interdependent nature of place.
 A systematic monitoring approach of Visitor Impact Management has been adopted by Jenolan Caves Reserve Trust. On reflection the aim of such an approach is to enable the organisation to identify when strategies need to be altered, that is to learn. The findings indicate that much about the visitor experience is emotional and relates to discourses or ways of seeing that aren&#8217;t fully articulated in the organisation. The findings also indicate strong links between place interpretations of visitors, staff, the organisation and others. It is possible that frameworks such as Visitor Impact Management, which examine a component of place meaning in a systematic way, will facilitate solutions to many visitor related issues, but when the issues relate to tacit processes in the organisation or arise from unfamiliar discourses will not be recognised and/or dealt with. Visitor Impact Management located in the broader context of organisational learning may provide a process that opens the organisation to the full depth of place meaning, and provide tools for engaging with a broader variety of meaning-making discourses.
 Qualitative methodology was adopted to answer these explorative questions. Specifically ethnographic methods of data collection were used: interviews, observations, and document analysis. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 79 staff and locals, and 140 visitors. These were recorded through note taking, returned to respondents for inspection (not to visitors), and then coded for items that provided insight into the relationship and meaning that Jenolan had inspired.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1097/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1097/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Branding nations as tourism destinations in the USA</field><field name="creator">Day, Gordon Jonathon</field><field name="description">Destination branding is an important focus of tourism marketing research and a cornerstone activity for many destination marketing organizations. National Tourism Branding is the specific activity of destination branding a nation to encourage tourism. This study examines National Tourism Branding from two perspectives. National Tourism Branding is examined from the perspective of the National Tourist Office (NTO) operating in the United States. The thesis also examines the National Tourism Brand (NTB), and the role of the National Tourism Office, from the perspective of commercial stakeholders in the brand development process. The study examines the attitudes of both tourism product and wholesalers to the branding process. This thesis began by exploring the phenomenon and process of branding with particular focus on the way branding is applied to nations and destinations in tourism marketing. The literature review examined the complex nature of destination brands noting that destination brands typically exist within a hierarchy of &#8220;place brands&#8221; and that destination brands exist in portfolios of brands due to the composite nature of destinations themselves. The role of stakeholders in the destination branding process was also reviewed in detail. Tourism Destinations, as composite entities with component products, have stakeholders concerned in the development of effective master branding of the destination. In addition, distribution channel members, reliant on the destination for business, are also stakeholders in the brand development process. In addition to &#8220;market driven&#8221; stakeholders destination marketers must also engage with &#8220;non-market driven&#8221; stakeholders including local residents, government and politicians. The literature review identified National Tourist Offices (NTOs) as the key drivers in the development of National Tourism Brands (NTB) and examined the activities of these organizations in the destination marketing and branding process. The process of destination branding was reviewed and compared to the general process of branding undertaken by consumer products. The development of brand strategy requires an assessment of the destination&#8217;s image, the development of a destination brand identity and the creation of a positioning strategy designed to meet brand and communications objectives. These activities are undertaken in the context of a specific target market. Destination brands are developed for the purpose of delivering benefits to the destination. The destination branding process is designed to increase the &#8220;brand equity&#8221; of the destination brand. Destination Brands can be described as public assets shared by the community and the tourism industry. As such the development of brands, while critical to National Tourist Offices is also an important issue to other users of the asset including tourism product and tourism intermediaries, both of which invest funds to promote the destination as part of their commercial offerings. The measures for assessing the value of the destination brand and its effectiveness in the market place are examined in the literature review. Chapter 2 examines the development of &#8220;Brand Australia&#8221; in the United States and reviews the Australian Tourist Commission&#8217;s marketing campaigns during the period 1996-2004. The thesis explored the way ATC used the Olympic Games held in Sydney in 2000 as both a catalyst for the development of Australia&#8217;s National Tourism Brand and as a brand partner, effectively cobranding Australia with the Olympics. The second section of Chapter 2 examined how the ATC engaged with partners in the development of the brand during this period. As a result of the literature review a series of key study areas were developed to address the nature of National tourism branding with particular focus on the activities of US based National Tourist Offices and the impacts on commercial stakeholders of National Tourism Activity. Within this framework three studies were undertaken to better understand the role of National Tourist Offices in the United States. Chapter 3 examines the results of these studies which focus on destination marketing and branding activities. As a result of the studies it was noted NTOs operating in the United States are relatively small operations, with modest levels of resources &#8211; both human and financial. Nevertheless, these organizations are tasked with significant goals and are committed to marketing to consumers in the largest most complex marketplace in the world. These NTOs consider destination branding an important activity that raises the profile of their countries, increases their marketing efficiency and effectiveness as well as those of their commercial stakeholders. These NTO operations in the United States have considerable freedom to interpret their brands in the market. They leverage their partners through both the use of industry input into strategy development and cooperative marketing. The NTOs perceive the greatest benefit of their brand activity is to provide a focused message to consumers while allowing partners to focus attention on sales/conversion activity. In order to better understand the impact of destination branding on the NTO and commercial stakeholders three additional studies were conducted. Study 4 was a two part content analysis which included analysis of ATC motivational brochures to examine the execution of brand positioning and an examination of tour wholesaler&#8217;s brochures. This analysis revealed that the NTO was able to devote both imagery and written copy to develop a brochure that provided both specific detail as well as a &#8220;holistic&#8221; impression that was consistent with brand values. The commercial brochures however relied heavily on images of the destination to convey brand values and so were limited in their ability to communicate the brand. Study 5 examined in detail the experience of two &#8220;market driven&#8221; stakeholder groups involved in the Australian branding process. As Australia&#8217;s NTO, the Australian Tourist Commission has government authority to promote Australia&#8217;s tourism brand and the ATC is committed to the success of the tourism industry. It was therefore instructive to examine the perceptions of Australia&#8217;s tourism providers and their channel partners of the Australian tourism brand, and it&#8217;s utility in generating passengers. This study found that both tourism product and their distribution partners, the travel wholesalers, are relatively small organizations with limited resources to achieve their marketing objectives. These organizations value the contribution of &#8220;Brand Australia&#8221; and consider their individual company&#8217;s performance is tied to the effectiveness of the brand Australia. These organizations perceive the greatest benefit they receive from Australian tourism branding is the ability to allocate resources to sales messages about their specific product offerings rather than to &#8220;back ground&#8221; information on the destination itself. Interestingly, despite their enthusiasm for Brand Australia these organizations perceive factors other than the ATC&#8217;s marketing activity drive the consumer buying process. In particular they attribute the greatest impact on raising awareness of the destination and creating desire to travel to &#8220;word of mouth&#8221; factors. The brand hierarchy of the National Tourism Brand often includes state and regional branding. In order to explore issues that occur when different destination marketers work with the same brand hierarchy a survey (Study 6) of leaders of Australia&#8217;s State Tourism Organizations (STOs) was conducted. This study revealed general alignment of branding objectives but concern that the various organizations involved in marketing Australia in the United States should invest greater energy in developing complementary brand strategies. In addition to the findings of the research several key insights have been generated in the development of this thesis. Firstly, it was noted NTB plays a variety of roles the in the brand architecture of the destination including &#8220;master brand&#8221;, &#8220;umbrella&#8221; brand and &#8220;driver brand&#8221;. It notes that due to the composite nature of destinations, destination brands can be considered as both a single brand and as a portfolio of component brands. The thesis also noted that the variety of stakeholders involved in the development of the brand as a public asset requires a that valuation of the benefits of the brand include not only benefits that accrue to the DMO or to the consumer but to the broader group of beneficiaries including the distribution network, the destination&#8217;s component products and the community to name a few. Finally it has also been noted that sustainable destination branding, despite the tendency of research to focus on only marketing issues, requires both marketing communication strategies and destination development strategies. Topics from this study were presented at the International Conference on Destination Branding and Marketing for Regional Tourism Development, 2005.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1101/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1101/2/02chapters1-3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1101/3/03chapters4-5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1101/4/04references.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1101/5/05appendices.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Is student achievement really immutable? : A study of cognitive development and student achievement in an Oregon school district</field><field name="creator">Endler, Lorna Christine</field><field name="description">In the educational climate of the USA, where many question the possibility of effecting genuine change in national achievement outcomes, the Scientific Thinking Enhancement Project (STEP) was delivered to three cohorts of students from 1999 to 2002 in Molalla, Oregon. At the start, the mean age of Cohorts A, B, and C was 11+, 12+, and 13+ years. The purpose of my study was to investigate whether the STEP had enhanced these students&#8217; cognitive development and school achievement. The STEP incorporated strategies from a British intervention that had been shown to have a substantial effect on children&#8217;s cognitive development and school achievement. Different test instruments were employed from those used in the British intervention, and the results of all tests were Rasch scaled. Cognitive change was estimated using Bond&#8217;s Logical Operations Test, with pre-intervention performance profiles serving as cross-sectional controls. Statistical analyses revealed some enhancement of cognitive development compared with controls, with cognitive gains across the spectrum of starting level, irrespective of starting age and level of parent education. Statistically significant overall cognitive gains were found for Cohorts B (0.27 SDs) and C (0.55 SDs). Data from state-mandated tests in Mathematics revealed significant overall gains against controls for Cohorts A (0.51 SDs) and B (0.19 SDs). Cohort B students also made late-onset significant gains over peers who missed the STEP in 8th grade (BLOT 1.01 SDs and Mathematics 1.09 SDs). Cohort B females showed a significant overall gain in state Reading &amp; Literature tests. There were no significant achievement gains against populations from non-project schools. A teacher survey showed general satisfaction with the STEP, but also revealed misconceptions about the intervention. Given that these teachers received little professional development, and did not deliver the entire intervention program, it is not surprising that the STEP did not yield results as strong as the original projects in the UK.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1102/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1102/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Places of suffering and pathways to healing: post-conflict life in Bidau, East Timor</field><field name="creator">Field, Annette Marie</field><field name="description">In the prelude to and aftermath of the plebiscite on 30 August 1999, in which 78.5% of
 East Timorese voters rejected autonomy within Indonesia and chose independence for
 their country, violent conflict raged throughout the country. This thesis concerns Bidau,
 which is an urban village located in Dili, the capital of East Timor. My central argument
 is that Bidau residents have been agents in their own recovery following the destruction
 of 1999. I stress that in seeking to understand what will assist with post-conflict
 recovery, we need to pay more attention to the social worlds of people affected by
 violence, rather than applying an individual trauma model. Accordingly, I investigate
 the various forms of suffering that residents experienced, including the fears of further
 violence, the different sicknesses, the grieving for deceased relatives and friends, the
 economic struggles, and the disruptions to life cycle rituals in Bidau. These diverse
 forms of suffering and their impacts became evident to me over twenty-six months of
 fieldwork in the period from 4 November 2000 to October 2003.
 In describing the diversity of the people who reside in the village, I distinguish
 three categories of residents &#8211; Portuguese Period Settlers, Indonesian Period Settlers and
 Post-ballot Residents &#8211; and also distinguish people from the Makassae ethnolinguistic
 group, who make up a quarter of the population, and span the three periods of
 settlement, arriving in Bidau from 1973 onwards. I explore the connections that enabled
 Bidau individuals and groups to find places of safety during the most violent months of
 1999 and show how people who returned or moved to Bidau once order was restored
 relied on kin networks and other social affiliations to rebuild their lives. I argue that
 embeddedness in groups and guarantees of social support that Timorese customs offer
 facilitate and promote healing, as do some religious beliefs and practices. Participation in significant rituals, especially wedding and mortuary rites is central
 to the lives of Bidau residents and entails reciprocal obligations, especially between
 wife-givers and wife-takers. In my analysis of a delayed wedding and various mortuary
 rituals, I show the ability and determination of East Timorese to organise such rituals
 despite all they have suffered. These rituals expand social networks of support and have
 the potential to make and strengthen alliances. An exegesis of a lamentation performed
 for a recently deceased grandmother shows the complexities of the social and material
 obligations that East Timorese custom requires.
 By examining rituals in three settings &#8211; public space, the private space inside
 houses, and the intermediate space of verandas and gardens &#8211; I show the significance of
 the spatial dimensions of rituals and other practices and how these are closely related to
 the social processes of the household and the architectural space of the house. The
 reconstruction of the physical environment, especially repairs to residents&#8217; private
 homes, was a critical part of the processes of recovery, as houses were needed not just
 for shelter, but also because they helped define ritual spaces and enabled householders

It documents the gradual shift from a conventional archaeological approach to one which addresses issues of the empowerment of indigenous (and other) people in terms of their heritage. It achieves this by tracing the development of my understanding of the contemporary cultures of northern Cape peoples through the implementation (and consequent frustrations) of the original project. As a result of this work, present models of heritage management are questioned in terms of two broad areas. The first is related to the notion of 'consultation' and the way in which this is seen as an 'empowering' process for indigenous people. This process is examined in terms of a number of factors, including the problems of effective communication (including language difficulties) between the researcher and the communities in which they work; the history of black-white power relations on former Aboriginal reserves in Queensland; and the way in which the hegemony of western scientific perspectives may impact on contemporary notions of culture and identity. It is proposed that in northern Cape York, 'consultation' could be seen as a disempowering process. The second major contribution of this research has been a questioning of the way in which 'heritage' has been (and currently is) defined. In northern Cape York, archaeological 'sites' are significant in terms of contemporary cosmology through the stories, beliefs and practices that are associated with them. They can be seen as 'theatrical props' and as mnemonic devices which can invoke memories and history. These memories, stories, beliefs, practices and places provide the shape and form of the 'cultural landscape'. Moreover, it can be seen that this cultural landscape is the framework upon which contemporary notions of local identity are constructed. This view of 'sites' and 'landscapes' is in contrast with scientific models of site assessment and heritage managem&amp;t which focus more on the distant past. While this may have relevance to the heirs of a culture, it is suggested that it is not, in northern Cape York, the primary concern. Alternatives, such as the 'Community-based approach', which is concerned with defining 'elements of identity' are suggested as a more appropriate focus in this area. More generally, it is suggested that the focus of heritage should be on the 'practice' rather than the 'fabric' of a culture. That is, that we should look also to the present rather than just to the past. The research demonstrates the distance between indigenous and scientific perspectives of heritage within the context of northern Cape York and suggests that this could be examined in other contexts. An important point made in the thesis is that this 'distance' may also be observed within western culture. That is, that the scientific or archaeological discourse of heritage may be equally distanced from 'ordinary people' in the west. The insights into this thesis have been drawn from interactions with people from northern Cape York. It is suggested however that my response to these interactions stemmed from the feminist perspective which informs my research. The antecedents of this feminist response can be seen in the early days of heritage management in this country and the development of an indigenous involvement in the discipline. It can also be seen in other contexts in which feminist archaeologists have worked with indigenous groups. Finally, the relocation of heritage towards 'practice' rather than 'fabric' is of relevance in terms of the definition of native title in Australia. It recognises the dynamism of cultures by emphasising that the 'past' can only ever be in the present.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1109/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1109/2/02chapters1-3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1109/3/03chapters4-6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1109/4/04chapters7-9.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1109/5/05chapters10-12.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1109/6/06references.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">National policy implementation in Queensland: the politics of National Competition Policy in the 1990s</field><field name="creator">Heyward, Brett</field><field name="description">This is a thesis that focuses on the implementation of a national policy platform &#8211; the National Competition Policy &#8211; by the Queensland Government. NCP involved difficult government decisions, and the policy often became regarded &#8211; and often wrongly - as epitomising a broad range of unpalatable and controversial socio-economic changes. In this context, this thesis proposes an analysis of how implementation succeeded, almost against the odds. The overall argument is that a broad-ranging, national policy, derived from a collaborative forum of Australian heads of government, and overseen by a new intergovernmental watchdog, can be implemented successfully in a State, even during politically volatile times. The agreement on NCP was without peer or precedent. It encompassed a wide array of reform initiatives spanning a ten-year implementation horizon. It also required the coordination of all tiers of Australian government to meet agreed milestones set in the original agreement. The creation of an independent implementation watchdog in the form of the National Competition Council (NCC) was a key component of the institutional arrangements that accompanied the reform effort. NCP implementation coincided with a period of significant political volatility in Queensland, which led to leaders of major political parties adopting inaccurate rhetorical positions on NCP in public forums. As a result, the NCC and the Queensland government were brought into conflict on a regular basis. The analysis provided in this thesis shows that NCP had important structural features that served to buffer implementation from populist political attack. These features included: a symbolic union between the leaders of Australian governments, achieved through the signing of formal NCP documentation; the creation of an independent oversight body in the NCC, designed to monitor implementation and to insure against goal displacement; and the establishment of a financial incentive package tied to the achievement of key milestones. This thesis also shows that a key failing of the NCP agreement was the lack of ongoing engagement with the heads of Australian governments, acting as a collective, as the implementation process moved forward. This flaw isolated the NCC from political support and, as a consequence, left it - and NCP generally - without a visible source of political leadership. Ironically, this arrangement assisted Queensland to implement NCP as successive governments were able to distance themselves from the policy by blaming the reform effort on the NCC. The persistent parochialism of Queensland politics presents important implications for the implementation of national policies, not only NCP. If they are to be successfully implemented, policies must withstand the likely political barrage they will receive in political environments such as that which existed in Queensland in the mid to late 1990s. The key is to design mechanisms that will buffer, and in fact enable, the politics to be played out, while at the same time give shelter to the implementation effort.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1110/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1110/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An uneasy legacy: Vietnam veterans and Australian society</field><field name="creator">Hiddlestone, Janine Francis</field><field name="description">The Vietnam War is remembered more for the controversy than the war itself. This has contributed to the stereotyping of the war and those who fought in it. War is always political in nature, but the politics of the Vietnam War provided a series of distinctive complications that heralded a divergence from Australia&#8217;s traditional approaches to war and remembrance. This thesis examines the origins, veracity and consequences of the veteran stereotypes. It uses a range of sources, including documents, film, and interviews to explore the experience of veterans since the war ended &#8211; and ultimately their struggle to find a suitable place in Australian history. There is a methodological focus on oral history, based on a group of veterans in the North Queensland region. The study finds that there is neither a simple nor a single explanation, but rather a series of events, decisions and outcomes accumulating over a period of time. Veteran-related issues emerged initially in the United States of America, but this does not indicate that they were purely American problems and responses. Rather, the issues were addressed there first. The relative size of the different veteran populations played an important role, with the Australian contingent smaller and more widely spread, geographically. However, some of the more extreme images emanating from the US were applied to the emerging representations in Australia. The impact of those stereotypes is complex: while they were most often a burden to veterans, they could also offer some advantages, being concurrently helpful and hurtful. This made finding a suitable identity problematic, as few veterans wanted to identify with the stereotypes, but nonetheless sometimes found themselves trapped by them. Rather than discovering the popularly perceived group of disturbed malcontents, however, the broad scope of the sources (particularly the interviews) revealed a group of men searching for an historical context into which to place their experiences both during the war and in the following years. The evidence revealed a group of average Australians who, for a period thirty years ago, were asked to make the ultimate sacrifice. The interviews offered the opportunity to provide context to a difficult history, contributing not only to the study of the conflict, but to a wider Australian public memory in a country whose war stories have had so much impact.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1113/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1113/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impacts and management of Cenchrus ciliaris (buffel grass) as an invasive species in northern Queensland</field><field name="creator">Jackson, Janice</field><field name="description">Cenchrus ciliaris L. (buffel grass) (Poaceae) is recognized as one of Australia&#8217;s most serious environmental weeds. This introduced grass is associated with loss of native species and alteration of fire regimes. However there is considerable controversy regarding its weed status as it is also highly valued as a pasture species for arid and semi-arid zones. Quantitative studies are needed to determine its ecological effects. In addition, its spread into non-target areas, including conservation reserves, means that there is considerable interest in strategies for containing or eliminating C. ciliaris. These two issues, the effects of C. ciliaris on native species and strategies for managing C. ciliaris, are the focus of this thesis. The relationship between C. ciliaris and herbaceous species richness was investigated in two studies at a range of scales up to 64 m2 in open woodlands in north-eastern Queensland. In the first study, the herbaceous species composition of sites with and without C. ciliaris were compared. Cenchrus ciliaris-dominated sites had fewer herbaceous species than non-C. ciliaris sites at all scales investigated and this pattern was found for the major plant groups (perennial grasses, legumes and other forbs) present. In the second study, the relationship between varying levels of C. ciliaris biomass and species richness was investigated at one site. The relationship between varying levels of a dominant native grass, Bothriochloa ewartiana (Domin) C.E. Hubb. (Poaceae), and species richness was also determined for comparison with the C. ciliaris biomass-richness relationship. In this study, species richness was negatively associated with increasing C. ciliaris biomass at some scales and it appeared that C. ciliaris had a greater effect on richness than B. ewartiana. The negative association between C. ciliaris and species richness is consistent with the view that invasion by C. ciliaris poses a threat to biodiversity. However, the precise cause of the relationship has yet to be determined. The strategic use of fire offers potential to control unwanted species. To evaluate fire as a tool for reducing C. ciliaris abundance, the effects of season of burning on two C. ciliaris-dominated communities in north Queensland were investigated. Three treatments were imposed in small plots at both sites: early dry season burn, late dry season burn and control (no burn). These treatments were selected to exploit differences in fire characteristics and vegetation responses to fire associated with different season of burning. The herbaceous species present and their cover were recorded before and after the fires and post-fire seedling emergence was monitored. To help understand the mechanisms by which fire may alter community composition, burning treatment effects on the availability of establishment sites and propagules were also investigated. Fire affects establishment site availability by reducing resident plant competition, by altering nutrient availability and by altering soil surface condition. Three studies were conducted to investigate treatment effects on establishment sites: (1) C. ciliaris plants were monitored to determine mortality, (2) a bioassay technique was used to assess plant nutrient availability and (3) a &#8216;pot&#8217; experiment was conducted to examine the effects of different soil surface cover on seedling emergence to help predict the effects of litter removal on emergence patterns. Fire effects on propagule supply were investigated by monitoring flowering in C. ciliaris. A germination method was used to determine soil seed bank composition. Overall, burning had little effect on these communities. The intensities of the fires were low to moderate (300-3030 kWm-1). At Dalrymple there was an unexpected reversal of intensities; the mean intensity of early dry season fires was higher than that of late dry season fires. The fires caused no major changes in composition, few C. ciliaris plants were killed and no changes in nutrient availability or seed bank composition were detected. Although these short-term studies of single fires do not allow definitive recommendations regarding the use of fire to manage C. ciliaris, they provide information that will aid future research. I found that fire could kill C. ciliaris plants and reduce C. ciliaris cover. This contrasts with the positive fire feedback model generally proposed for C. ciliaris. Cenchrus ciliaris mortality was higher with early dry season burning at Dalrymple, suggesting that higher intensity fires will be more effective in eliminating C. ciliaris plants and/or that C. ciliaris plants may be more susceptible to fire at this time because they have not fully senesced. Apparent low densities of perennial grass seeds in the seed banks of these communities may be exploited: over-sowing with native perennial grasses after fire may encourage shifts in perennial grass dominance. There is an urgent need for management strategies that reduce, prevent or contain invasive weed invasion. Further work is required to investigate the application of fire regimes in C. ciliaris-dominated communities. Of particular interest are differences in growth and/or phenology between C. ciliaris and native species in these grasslands that may be exploited to disadvantage C. ciliaris.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1114/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1114/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hollywood dreaming: satires of Hollywood 1930-2003</field><field name="creator">Jericho, Greg</field><field name="description">This thesis examines film and literary satires of Hollywood 1930 &#8211; 2003 and asserts that such satires are attacks on the Hollywood Dream. The study reveals that these satires focus on two common themes: the artificiality of Hollywood, and the amoral and corruptive nature of Hollywood. The study examines the depiction of the Hollywood Dream within satires of the industry and demonstrates its increasing importance in American culture. The similarity of themes in film and literary satires highlights an interesting dialogue between the two modes which has not been thoroughly investigated. Although satirists&#8217; approaches towards the artificiality of Hollywood vary greatly, the most significant treatment of the theme in both literary and film satires is one which gains much understanding through use of Jean Baudrillard&#8217;s theory of simulacra and simulation. My examination also investigates the tendency of characters within satires of Hollywood to discard previous identities and create in their place a Hollywood identity. Such an identity is linked to the artificiality of Hollywood and is displayed by satirists as a prerequisite for one wishing to achieve the Hollywood Dream. While there have been numerous studies on novels on the Hollywood industry and its films, this study is unique in examining both literary and film satires of Hollywood together, and covering such an extended period of time. It hopes to show that satires of Hollywood have reached a critical juncture. The satire of many recent works has become moribund due to the public&#8217;s awareness of and apathetic attitude towards the amorality and hypocrisy of Hollywood, and because these satires fail to acknowledge the intrinsic artificiality of Hollywood.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1115/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1115/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analytical and experimental investigation of active vibration control techniques on coupled plate structures</field><field name="creator">Keir, John</field><field name="description">This PhD thesis presents a theoretical and experimental investigation using active control to attenuate the vibration responses associated with coupled plate structures. Three plate structures were examined, which corresponded to an L, T and X shaped plate. The plate theory used to determine the dynamic and controlled responses of the coupled plate structures is presented for a generic structure consisting of four finite plates joined together at right angles in a X-shape. The theory for active vibration control of the coupled plate using single and multiple control actuators and error sensors is also presented for both dependent and independent control. The use of multiple actuators and error sensors in various arrangements to attenuate the response of various coupled plate structures is demonstrated. The number and location of the control forces and error sensors are varied, and their effects on the control performance are compared. In addition, the effect of the control forces driven dependently and independently was investigated. For active control at discrete resonance frequencies, the global response of the structure was observed. Experiments were conducted in order to validate theoretical results on the active control of the global response at a low resonance frequency. The results showed excellent correlation, validating the effectiveness of the active control application. An energy method to predict the vibrational response and its transmission between coupled structures in the medium to high frequency ranges is Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA). In this thesis, SEA is used to model several built-up structures and estimate their vibrational response using energy flow relationships. Energy levels of the L, T, X-shaped plates, and a 7-plate structure, predicted from the exact analytical waveguide model are compared with those of conventional SEA models. A hybrid approach between the two techniques is also presented. The hybrid method uses the analytical waveguide method to estimate the input power and coupling loss factors used in the conventional SEA equations. The energy levels in individual plate subsystems using the exact analytical method, SEA, and the hybrid technique are compared.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1116/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1116/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Troubling essentialised constructions of cultures: an analysis of a critical discourse analysis approach to teaching and learning language and culture</field><field name="creator">Kocatepe, Mehtap</field><field name="description">The thesis explores the ways in which a group of international students respond to a critical discourse analysis approach to teaching language and culture. It reports a qualitative case study of the implementation of two five-week programs in two existing classes in an ELICOS (English Language Intensive Course for Overseas Students) centre. In the field of foreign/second language teaching there are persuasive arguments for the introduction of an explicit focus on culture through language in ways that raise students&#8217; awareness of cultural diversity and trouble the stereotypical, normative assumptions that underpin many cultural representations. Working from this perspective, I used critical discourse analysis as the basis of a program designed to contribute to the development of a critical awareness of culture with the aim of encouraging students to engage with new, hybrid and transcultural forms of representation, identity and social participation. The data, consisting of recorded classroom interactions, interviews and reflective student journals, have been analysed drawing on postcolonial theory. In particular, I focus on the discourses that constitute students&#8217; responses to the pedagogical intervention and explore the subject positions they appear to take up. The research seeks to add to a growing body of work that explores the links between the deconstruction of cultural essentialism in texts and reconstructed understandings of difference and diversity. The present study showed that the use of the analytical tools of CDA in conjunction with ethnographic methods was effective in encouraging students to problematise the circulation of hierarchical categorisations in various text types and to recognise cultural hybridity and complexity. Some students demonstrated that a deconstruction of textual realities and the conceptualisation of alternatives led to the disruption of self/other margins and facilitated students&#8217; negotiations of difference in the fluid, hybrid spaces in-between familiar and foreign, local and global discourses, relations and identities. Responses from a number of students suggest that some elements of the program constituted particularly effective components of a critical discourse analysis approach to teaching and learning culture and the thesis explores ways in which these elements could be developed in future programs. The thesis also incorporates a self-reflexive analysis of the research where I question my own role in introducing a particular way of approaching texts and viewing the world. In particular, some students perceived this pedagogical intervention as an imposition of my own ideals of appropriate methods of questioning and ways of defining and identifying discriminatory views and practices. This highlights the complexity involved in using the authority of teaching to make available to students a particular worldview with which they can resist authoritative worldviews. The data suggest that a critical discourse analysis approach and its attendant strategies for problematising and questioning the legitimacy of assumptions and claims in a text might have created, at least for some students, the conceptual space to turn a critical gaze on the pedagogy to which they were exposed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1117/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1117/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Edible frog harvesting in Indonesia: evaluating its impact and ecological context</field><field name="creator">Kusrini, Mirza Dikari</field><field name="description">Frogs are harvested in Indonesia for both domestic consumption and export. Concerns have been expressed about the extent of this harvest, but there have been no detailed studies on the edible frog trade in Indonesia, or on the status or population dynamics of the harvested species. To investigate the possible impact of this practise, I collected data on harvesting and trading of frog legs in Java, Indonesia. I also investigated the ecology and population dynamics of the three species that are most heavily harvested: Fejervarya limnocharis-iskandari complex, F. cancrivora and Limnonectes macrodon. The first step of the study quantified the extent of the Indonesian edible frog leg trade for export and domestic purposes. Harvesting is an unskilled job and serves as livelihood for many people. There is no regulation of this harvest, and species taken and size limits are governed by market demand. The most harvested species in Java are F. cancrivora and L. macrodon. Harvests occur all year long. The number of frogs harvested fluctuates and is controlled by natural forces such as dry/wet seasons, moon phase, and planting seasons. Records of the international trade in Indonesian frog legs are available from 1969 to 2002; the mass of frozen frog legs exported has increased over the years. I used data on the relative weights of frogs and their legs to estimate how many frogs were represented by the export records. In 1999-2002 an average of 3,830,601 kg of frozen frog legs were exported annually; this represents an export harvest of approximately 28 to 142 million frogs, all with masses greater than 80 g, the minimum size of animals that have legs considered suitable for export. I used data collected by following frog hunters in the field to assess their capture rates and the numbers and sizes of frogs captured. I found that only about one-eighth of frogs captured are of sizes acceptable for export, and therefore estimate that the domestic market is approximately 7 times as large as the export market. In the second step of the study, I used field data on F. limnocharis-iskandari complex, F. cancrivora and L. macrodon to gain greater understanding of the population biology and dynamics of the harvested species. Populations of F. limnocharis-iskandari complex and F. cancrivora were studied in six rice fields in West Java during the planting seasons of 2002 and 2003. Both F. limnocharis-iskandari complex and F. cancrivora were abundant in the rice fields, with estimated overall mean densities of 193.71 and 39.76 per hectare. The mean density of F. cancrivora was very similar to that of unharvested populations in Malaysia (8.6 &#8211; 91.2 per hectare) (Jaafar, 1994) and was much higher than the mean density (0.7 frogs/ha) found for Rana tigerina, the larger species of edible Indian paddy field frog investigated by Dash and Mahanta (1993). These comparisons suggest that densities of F. cancrivora in Javan rice fields are relatively high, despite ongoing harvesting pressure. F. limnocharisiskandari complex and F. cancrivora were able to breed continuously all year without an apparent season. Both species showed sexual size dimorphism, with females larger than males. Both appear to be short lived. The population dynamics of L. macrocodon were observed at two stream sites West Java: Cilember and Ciapus Leutik. The habitat at Ciapus Leutik is relatively heavily modified bu human activity, while Cilember is in a nature reserve and ls less disturbed. A mark recapture study was conducted once a month between June 2002 and May 2003 (a continuous 12 month sampling period), and in January, April and July 2004. Skeletochronological analysis of phalanges removed during toe clipping suggests that this species lives longer than F. cancrivora or F. limnocharis-iskandari complex. Recapture rates of L. macrodon in both locations were low and more frogs were observed during periods of higher rainfall. In this study, more L. macrodon were found at Cilember than at Ciapus Leutik stream. It is unclear whether the low number of frogs at Ciapus Leutik was caused by over-harvesting or by other factors. There is a need for further monitoring to obtain a greater understanding of the population dynamics of this species. In conjunction with my field work, I measured a number of parameters to determine the type and extent of pesticide residues present in rice fields, and to attempt to determine whether those and another potential stressor, drought, might be affecting the morphology, body condition, or developmental stability of frogs. I also surveyed populations of the rice field frogs and L. macrodon for the emerging disease chytridiomycosis, which could strongly affect the population dynamics of the frogs. Two types of pesticide residues were detected in water and soil: organochlorine (lindane, aldrin, heptachlor, dieldrin and endosulfan) and organophospate (chlorpyrifos and diazinon). Six organochlorines type (BHC, lindane, aldrin, heptachlor, dieldrin and endosulfan) and three organophosphates (propenofos, chlorpyrifos and diazinon) were detected in the livers and leg muscles of both frog species. Almost all pesticide residues were low compared to the Maximum Residue Limit set by WHO and the Government of Indonesia although a few individuals showed higher pesticide residues contents. Pesticide residue levels did not appear to be related to any measure of frog condition or stress. Both species of rice field frogs exhibited relatively low percentages of abnormalities, probably within the normal range. Only F. limnocharis-iskandari complex consistently exhibited levels of fluctuating asymmetry in excess of measurement error. Levels of asymmetry differed between characters. Higher limb asymmetries were elevated in 2002 compared to 2003, whilst body condition was lower in 2003. It is possible that the lower body condition in 2003 was caused by stress from an environmental factor, in this case the drought in that year. It is clear that for both F. limnocharis-iskandari complex and F. cancrivora, fluctuating asymmetry is not a powerful indicator of stress. There was no sign of chytrid infection in any samples of the three species. To assess the impact of harvesting, I used two approaches. I developed a model of the population dynamics of F. cancrivora and ran simulations for ranges of parameters including harvesting rate. The simulation indicated that current levels of harvest may be near the maximum level sustainable by the population. My second approach was to compare data on the population biology and distribution of both Fejervarya species to criteria for assessing the conservation status of the species, i.e. IUCN Red Categories and the CITES Res. Conf. 9.24 on the Criteria for Amendment of Appendices I and II. My assessment using listing criteria showed that neither F. limnocharisiskandari complex or F. cancrivora are qualified for inclusion into any IUCN Red List and CITES Appendices. On the other hand, more consideration needs to be given to L. macrodon. This frog is not qualified for inclusion in CITES Appendix I. At present, it is not possible to determine whether this species could be listed as vulnerable or in CITES Appendix II due to a lack of data, such as survivorship among stages, and habitat size, on the population biology of this species. Recommendations for management of the harvest include: 1) regular monitoring of this trade especially in other islands such as Sumatra by the scientific authority of CITES (The Indonesian Institute of Science or Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia, LIPI), 2) regular monitoring of the numbers of export companies and their middleman, 3) developing a simple identification key and distributing it to the middlemen to ensure correct identifications, 4) assessing the possibility of breeding local frogs for this trade to replace the farming of the exotic frog Rana catesbeiana, and 5) ensuring that harvest is limited to species that are not adversely impacted.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1118/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1118/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Patterns in the composition and distribution of the vertebrate fauna, desert uplands bioregion, Queensland.</field><field name="creator">Kutt, Alexander Sulev</field><field name="description">Approximately 20% of the Australian continent consists of tropical savanna rangelands, landscapes of dense native grass and scattered trees, dominated by cattle grazing. However a common problem in reviewing ecological patterns and processes of tropical savanna rangelands is the lack of adequate biological data for such conservation planning. James et al. (1995) and Fisher (2001a) recommended a framework for undertaking research in Australia&#8217;s rangelands including identifying spatial and temporal patterns of biota, quantifying the impact of pastoralism, developing concepts and tools for regional conservation planning and identifying the effects of fire. The primary objective of this study was, using the framework described above, to examine the patterns within, and environmental controls on, the vertebrate fauna assemblage in the Desert Uplands Bioregion.
 The Desert Uplands Bioregion
 The Desert Uplands is one of six tropical savanna bioregions that occur in Queensland. It is very poorly studied, with quite meagre information regarding its native biota. Its climate is semi-arid and the vegetation consists predominantly of Acacia and Eucalypt woodlands, ephemeral lake habitats and grasslands. Of the original 6.8 million hectares of vegetation cover in the Desert Uplands, by 1999 over 900,000 hectares, representing almost 14% of the bioregion, were cleared. National Parks and resource reserves in the Desert Uplands currently cover 182,100 hectares, or 2.6% of the bioregion. Including data from this study, 431 vertebrate species (24 amphibians, 229 birds, 61 mammals, 117 reptiles) have been recorded in the bioregion, and this total includes 59 species of conservation significance. Beef cattle grazing is the major form of primary production, with a majority of the land being leasehold (&gt;70%).
 Zoogeographic context
 The broad zoogeographic context of the Desert Uplands bioregion was investigated by examining composition of the vertebrate fauna in comparison to neighbouring Queensland bioregions and those across the northern Australian tropical savannas. Given its recognition as a discrete entity, the Desert Uplands Bioregion should support landscapes and biota that are distinct from neighbouring bioregions. The region also includes a number of recognised biogeographic barriers and the confluence of three major drainage basins. Correlation, ordination and variation in measures of Beta-diversity were used to investigate patterns in the variation in species richness, composition and environment.
 This broad overview of bioregional patterns of vertebrate assemblages identified the Desert Uplands fauna as, on the one hand, being typical of semi-arid regions and, on the other hand supporting a fauna of intergradation and replacement. Both inland and coastal elements are represented. Historically, the frontier of marked climate gradients would have oscillated across the Desert Uplands, and the distribution of many vertebrate fauna examples suggests this bioregion is central to vicariant speciation. A number of species typical either of more mesic or xeric environments reaches the edge of their range within the Desert Uplands. Three endemic reptiles were recorded which suggests a degree of isolation and speciation in this landscape.
 Vertebrate fauna composition patterns
 A systematic quadrat-based vertebrate fauna survey of the Desert Uplands Bioregion was undertaken to investigate the patterns of distribution, composition and abundance of species, and the environmental factors that determine these. A standardised quadrat array was used as the basic sampling unit, stratified by regional ecosystems &#8211; unique combinations of land units, vegetation and soils. Generalised linear modelling was used to investigate the relationship of environmental factors to within-quadrat species richness and species abundance. Gradients in vertebrate composition were examined using multivariate classification and ordination, and correlation with environmental variables.
 The Desert Uplands fauna consisted of a mix of vertebrate species some restricted to particular habitats and environmental extremes (e.g. hummock and tussock grasslands), and others, which were more catholic, forming indistinct and overlapping suites of woodland species. This latter group was characterised by a core assemblage complemented by a series of more patchily distributed species that responded in various ways to subtle environmental shifts (e.g. in substrate type, ground and canopy cover). Models exploring variation in species richness identified a positive relationship with structural complexity of the vegetation. Overall the patterns of species composition and distribution were commensurate with those recorded in the Mitchell grass, Acacia and Eucalyptus woodlands across the northern tropical savannas.
 Regional ecosystems and other surrogates of vertebrate fauna diversity
 An essential component of biodiversity conservation is selecting areas where conservation management effort will be concentrated. As regional ecosystems are the primary classification used for conservation planning in the Desert Uplands, the adequacy of this land unit as a surrogates for vertebrate fauna composition and distribution, and in particular sites of high species richness or sites with a high number of species of conservation significance, was examined using correlation, analysis of variance and measures of habitat breadth. The surrogate value of other land classifications was also tested using analysis of similarity. The patterns of spatial fidelity between the richness and composition of flora and fauna assemblages recorded was investigated via linear and matrix correlation. A minimum-set algorithm was used to investigate complementarity between regional ecosystems, vertebrate fauna and plant taxa using the quadrat samples.
 In general, regional ecosystems types were found to have a broad correspondence to fauna composition variation, though there was clear partitioning in species composition between the more distinctive regional ecosystem types (e.g. grasslands versus woodlands), and blurring between types that were structurally similar. The spatial fidelity between biotic assemblages at a quadrat level was also varied, but was strongest between related groups (all vertebrates and component taxa, all plants, and upper ground strata). The minimum-set algorithm indicated that selecting quadrats to reserve species-rich taxa (ground cover plants, birds) will capture a majority of other species, but does not necessarily guarantee these will fully reserve the complement of rare species. Where there was high disparity in species richness, composition and structural heterogeneity between sites, there was better complementarity. This suggests that site complementarity techniques may be inadequate as a planning tool for targeting rare, unusual, seasonal or intangible biotic assemblages. Effects of grazing and fire on fauna and flora.
 The impacts of pastoral land use and fire history was investigated within a single widespread regional ecosystem - open E. similis woodland with Triodia pungens ground cover. Many properties have long or permanently ungrazed paddocks within this vegetation type due to the presence of heartleaf poison bush Gastrolobium grandiflorum. Using a subset of standardised quadrat samples, the impact of fire age and grazing history and the interaction of these two processes on fauna and plant composition were examined. Statistical investigation included analysis of similarity and ordination, and generalised linear modelling was used to explore in detail the species and group response to the treatments and interaction terms.
 Fire and grazing had a significant influence on the distribution and abundance of a number of fauna and flora species and guilds with the impact of both processes combining to mute or accentuate the measured species responses. Time since fire is the best predictor of vertebrate species composition, while for ants grazing class was superior. However for terrestrial species such as reptiles and small mammals, the grazing effects were quite marked. There were several fire and grazing increaser and decreaser species with an interaction between fire and grazing clearly evident for some species (Pseudomys desertor and P. delicatulus). Shifts in structure of plant communities partially accounted for these patterns. These results suggest that in tropical savanna pastoral landscapes both grazing and fire effects should be quantified to avoid measuring spurious species responses. There is often suggestion that intermediate grazing pressure causes neutral biodiversity impacts, irrespective of fire effects, however these results indicate that even light to moderate grazing may result in some community disarray.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1119/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1119/2/02chapters1-2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1119/3/03chapters3-4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1119/4/03chapters5-6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1119/5/05references.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1119/6/06appendices.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A multi-scale analysis of population dynamics and sexual size dimorphism in a widely distributed coral reef fish family (Acanthuridae)</field><field name="creator">Laman Trip, Elisabeth Daniele</field><field name="description">There is a large amount of evidence that the demography and associated life history features of coral reef fish vary across a range of spatial scales. Many Indo-Pacific species are particular in that their geographical distribution extends over ocean basins, and there is increasing evidence that a number of coral reef fish display highly asymptotic growth trajectories. This thesis uses an age-based approach to examine the mechanisms and patterns of variation in the demography and associated life history features over broad geographical scales and in the context of asymptotic growth, exploring the nature of the trade-offs in life history traits associated with variation in growth in coral reef fish. Over 1500 individuals of three Acanthurid species, Ctenochaetus striatus, Acanthurus nigricans and Acanthurus leucosternon, were collected at 14 locations across the Indo-Pacific region. Three critical demographic parameters were examined: mean adult body size, growth rate and longevity, and the relationship between size, age and sex was established using the re-parameterised equation of the Von Bertalanffy Growth Function. We found a longitudinal trend in life span, with Indian Ocean populations being shorter lived than those of the Pacific region, suggesting the presence of differences in population dynamics and recruitment patterns between ocean basins. In contrast, there was no predictable pattern in growth, which varied primarily across locations indicating a substantial effect on growth of local habitat conditions. There was a clear sex-specific structure in growth within all populations sampled. The mechanism underlying the variation in size among and within populations was a mechanism of fast initial growth, which was consistent across species, geographical scales, and across the sexes. This result indicates that adult body size is determined by the rate of growth during the early years of post-settlement life of all individuals, regardless of the nature of sexual ontogeny, suggesting the absence of a trade-off between reproductive and somatic growth in both males and females of the study species. The magnitude of the differences in size between the sexes increased in populations where large absolute adult size was favoured, suggesting an allometric relationship between sexual size dimorphism and the rate of growth of the larger sex. The direction of sexspecific size distributions of the study species varied with adult body size of males, providing evidence that female-biased sexual size dimorphism in acanthurid species is the result of selection for small body size in males. This study illustrates the importance of early post-settlement life history in shaping the demography and life histories in coral reef fish with a highly asymptotic form of growth, and suggests that determinate growth is associated with: 1) a large potential for flexibility in growth, 2) constraints on the nature of the mechanisms underlying variation in size across geographical scales, and between the sexes, and 3) an evolutionary life history trade-off between juvenile survival and lifetime reproductive success overriding the costs of reproductive growth of females.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1122/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1122/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Past visions, present lives: sociality and locality in a Torres Strait community</field><field name="creator">Lahn, Julie</field><field name="description">This thesis explores dynamics of sociality and local identity on Warraber Island in the Torres Strait. I argue that Warraber residents' representation of themselves as a distinctive collectivity needs to be understood in terms of indigenous conceptions of relatedness and difference and with reference to local moral terms of communal life, in particular a valorised striving towards the idealised vision of moral relations known as gud pasin. This value is informed by a dense network of cognatic connections existing among Warraber residents &#8211; encapsulated in the local discourse of &#8220;ol wan pamle&#8221; (all one family), in addition to shared identification as a Christian community. Warraberans envision the past through ideas of temporal rupture, indexed to the arrival of Christianity in the region and linked to the positive transformation of Warraber life. This forms a reference point in local thinking about ancestors. Warraberans depict their ancestors as both 'natives' and 'foreigners' linked respectively to the pre-Christian period and the marine industries of the post-missionised colonial era. These temporal associations, and their implicit moral inscriptions, generate poignant areas of ambiguity concerning personal ancestry, and also prominent pre-Christian sites and dance performances thought to be associated with head-taking and sorcery. The image of the sorcerer is itself contentious, appearing partly as a moral Other, and partly as a source of local power. Such dynamics of difference appear as integral to contemporary social life on Warraber. Differing Christian affiliations, ancestral emphasis and perspectives on the past certainly contain potential for contestation. Productive activities are markedly gendered and family networks involve strong personalised loyalties that compete with broader social obligations. However, the value of gud pasin is shown as ultimately valorising inclusiveness, generosity and a concern with community harmony. Moreover residence on Warraber Island emerges as an important context for common experiences that help distinguish the population as a distinctive, emplaced community within the diversity of Torres Strait populations. Intense attachments to Warraber Island are communicated in local notions of 'belonging' to place. This is characterised by knowledge and familiarity and also by birth and residence. In this context, the marine realm continues to be a central component within Warraber collective identification and notions of local distinctiveness. Warraberans represent themselves both in historical and contemporary terms as incomparable marine workers, hunters and fishers. Transactions in marine products, whether related to generating income or for consumption, continue to be a focus of Warraber life and are inextricably woven into the practice of familial relations, whereby marine resources are transformed by human activity into a &#8216;currency&#8217; of relatedness shaped by moral understandings that inflect the landscape as much as the conduct of sociality.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1128/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1128/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population genetic relationships in the roseate tern: globally, regionally and locally</field><field name="creator">Lashko, Anna</field><field name="description">The roseate tern, Sterna dougallii, is a colonially nesting seabird which breeds on tropical and temperate islands in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans. The roseate tern is considered threatened in a number of regions, including the United States, Europe and South Africa. There are currently four or five recognised subspecies of roseate tern: one in the Atlantic Ocean; and three or four in the Indo-Pacific, with many authors questioning the validity of currently circumscribed subspecies. In this study, two kinds of genetic marker, ND2 and ND6 mitochondrial DNA sequences and microsatellite genotyping, were used to investigate the historical and contemporary relationships among roseate tern breeding colonies. I used samples from breeding colonies in Australia, Japan, Seychelles, South Africa, Azores, Ireland and the United States to investigate population structure in the roseate tern at a global scale, a regional scale and at a local scale within Australia. In addition, samples obtained from the non-breeding aggregations in Australia were included to determine whether mitochondrial DNA or microsatellite markers can be used to determine the origins of individuals in non-breeding aggregations. Sequencing of a combined total of 1381 base pairs of the ND2 and ND6 genes, and genotyping with five polymorphic microsatellite markers, revealed two distinct lineages of roseate tern: an Atlantic lineage; and an Indo-Pacific lineage. The genetic divergence between the two lineages (3.9% corrected mitochondrial DNA sequence divergence) represents a significant historic separation, with continental Africa implicated as the major long term barrier to gene flow between the two oceanic basins. The star-shaped phylogeny observed for both lineages suggests a recent range expansion from a common source in each oceanic basin, which is likely to have coincided with the stabilising of sea level following the last glacial period, approximately 20 000 years ago. The lack of population structure in mitochondrial DNA haplotypes within each oceanic basin suggests that cycles of range expansion and contraction to a glacial refuge have occurred during interglacial and glacial periods, respectively. This periodic range contraction, to a common glacial refuge within each oceanic basin, has allowed regular gene flow to occur among individuals within each oceanic basin, ameliorating any genetic divergence that may develop during interglacial periods. The most recent range expansion has resulted in secondary contact and introgression of the two lineages, identified in the breeding colony sampled in South Africa. The Atlantic subspecies, S. d. dougallii, is well supported by this study, but the currently recognised subspecies in the Indo-Pacific are not warranted based on genetic data. I recommend a formal revision of the subspecies designations, merging the three or four currently recognised subspecies in the Indo-Pacific. Microsatellite markers reveal that population structuring has developed among some breeding regions since the last range expansion. In the Atlantic Ocean, microsatellite analyses suggest that breeding colonies in Ireland and the United States have diverged from the Azores (RST = 0.28 &#8211; 0.36, P &lt; 0.05); however, due to the potential influence of population declines on the genetic variation in these colonies, I cannot reject the alternate hypothesis that individuals from the north Atlantic breeding colonies are regularly interbreeding. In the Indo-Pacific, the breeding colony in the Seychelles is divergent from the colonies in Australia and Japan (RST = 0.14 &#8211; 0.22, P &lt; 0.05), suggesting that the Indian Ocean serves as a current barrier to gene flow. There is no evidence for genetic divergence among colonies in Australia and Japan (RST = 0.03, P = 0.22), indicating that gene flow between the two regions, and among colonies in Australia, is occurring regularly. This may be facilitated via the mixing of individuals from different breeding colonies in the non-breeding aggregations. Due to the lack of genetic structure among breeding colonies in Australia and Japan, neither mitochondrial DNA or microsatellites could be used to determine the origins of individuals in non-breeding aggregations in Australia. During this study, I obtained evidence of hybridisation between roseate and black-naped terns. Further investigation of this revealed that paternal leakage, the transfer of paternal mitochondrial DNA along with the usual maternal transfer, had occurred as a result of the hybridisation event. This is the first evidence of hybridisation between the roseate and black-naped tern, and one of only a handful of instances of paternal leakage of mitochondrial DNA in animals.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1132/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1132/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of sport in Singapore : an Eliasian analysis</field><field name="creator">Lim, Lai Kuan</field><field name="description">This thesis traces and analyzes the development of sport in Singapore since its founding in 1819 to present. Using an Eliasian approach, this thesis examines empirical evidence gathered from official documents, such as sport policies and media reports, to show how sport has developed in Singapore. An Eliasian approach focuses on examining the figuration of sport as a network of interdependencies and how its development creates more and more interconnections with other social figurations. The widening network of interdependencies shapes the culture of sport in Singapore but it also reveals similarities and differences with the development of wider Singapore society. The analysis also examines the figuration of sport in relation to Elias's substantive themes of state formation and the dynamics of established and outsider relationships. Singapore has developed from a British colony to an independent country and over this period of time, it has also transformed from a virtually uninhabited island into a thriving first world nation. Although the seeming under-development of Singapore's sport appears to be at odds with the wider social development, parallels between the two can be drawn. Underlying both developments is the increasing regulation of practices and tightening of the chains of interdependencies. Medals may mark the level the sporting nationalism, but they do not indicate the increasing differentiation and integration of practices, identities and images of the disparate social groups. This thesis shows how sport emerged to its present form since the British colonized the practices, time and space of other social groups; how sport developed into a highly regulated practice and became intertwined with social identity formation and distinction. The development of the figuration of sport reveals the tension of the diminishing contrasts between the disparate of social groups and increasing varieties of the sport practices. The paradoxically unifying and dividing tensions that sport embodied by the 1930s, were appropriated by the Japanese government when they colonized the island. Sport became centralized and the direction and form of its development became more and more situated in the state. Sporting practices were no longer regulated just by the players and their sporting clubs, but by the imposition, direct and indirect, of the state. This shift in the pattern of control on the sporting conduct paralleled the nexus of social control. The increase in bureaucracy and complexity in the organization of the institution of sport widened the network of interdependencies between the state and the subjects but more significantly, the Japanese government also demonstrated the affective quality of sport in nationalizing disparate social groups. In independent Singapore the functions of sport have became increasingly specialized as well as heightened in significance. The rise in commercialism binds more and more people together not only on the functional level but also on the level of identity and image formation. Although Singapore has developed into a first world nation, its sporting achievements are those of a third world country. This thesis discusses how the dissonance in the economic and sporting achievement has provided currency for greater centralization of sport. It also examines the role of sport in producing and reproducing the global-local tension in the establishment of a Singapore identity as the country become more and more interdependent with the rest of the world. Whilst the trend of development of sport in Singapore suggests an increasing level of civilization, it was not a process unfettered with conflicts and tensions. The expansion of functions and rising self restraint in practices, identities and images were marked by continuities and discontinuities, civilizing and decivilizing spurts, integration and disintegration. Using an Eliasian theorisation of sport, the thesis reveals how sport has become more and more interconnected with the wider Singapore society at different historical junctures and how sport reveals the tensions of the cultural underpinnings of Singapore whilst at the same time functions both as a border and a bridge for different social groups.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1133/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1133/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The cognitive, perceptual, social, environmental, and developmental factors associated with child language ability</field><field name="creator">Lines, Katrina Ann</field><field name="description">Child language ability has been associated with cognitive, perceptual and social/developmental factors including auditory temporal processing, processing speed, cognitive capacity and verbal working memory. These factors have largely been identified through research on children with language impairments. In particular, specific language impairment (SLI) has been viewed as a unique opportunity to study the factors of importance in language development free from potentially confounding factors like intelligence, and social, physical and environmental effects (Leonard, 1998). The main aim of this research was to investigate whether the cognitive, perceptual and social/developmental factors identified in previous research really are important for normal language development as a whole, as the majority of research undertaken has not included children across the full range of normal language ability. In addition, the relationships between language, nonverbal intelligence and social, environmental and developmental factors are not usually considered in research on SLI due to the strict diagnostic criteria. However, these factors are hypothesised to have importance for language ability as a whole and have the potential for relationships with one another. Some task based questions were also examined. These included an investigation of McDonald and Christiansen&#8217;s (2002) contention that verbal working memory tasks are merely special types of language processing tasks, and predictions arising from Baddeley&#8217;s (1986) model of working memory. Participants included 158 seven to nine year old children who were administered a battery of language, nonverbal IQ and purpose-made tasks. The children&#8217;s parents were administered an interview that included their years of education and occupation, and language and physical risk factors for the child. Not surprisingly, results from correlational analyses indicate that most variables are significantly related to language ability. The strongest relationships for language ability were with nonverbal IQ, nonword repetition and the language developmental risk index. As was expected from the correlations, the mean differences between groups with low, average and high language ability reflect linear relationships. However, when the variance from nonverbal IQ or the language developmental risk index was removed from the analyses (via ANCOVA), no results remained significant. This indicates complex relationships between cognitive, perceptual and developmental factors, which were confirmed in the analysis of structural equation models. The best fitting model represented the hypothesis that cognitive capacity would predict language ability and was domain-specific as predicted by Baddeley&#8217;s theory of working memory. A model reversing the relationship between language and verbal working memory testing McDonald and Christiansen&#8217;s argument indicated that language ability has a significant effect on all study variables, and an almost perfectly collinear relationship with verbal working memory. The results of the study indicate that: a) multivariate research and analysis approaches are necessary to elucidate the complex predictors of language ability as univariate and quasi-experimental methods do not identify the underlying interrelationships, b) some verbal working memory tasks appear to be measuring language processing as argued by MacDonald and Christiansen, c) it may be impossible to remove the effects of language from experimental tasks, thus requiring novel means of quantifying these effects, and d) that classifying SLI as a distinct disorder may be erroneous as 13% of this nonclinical sample met all criteria for a diagnosis of SLI.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1134/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1134/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">(re)collections: developing a metadata application profile for the Quinkan Culture Matchbox</field><field name="creator">Lissonnet, Sophie</field><field name="description">The Quinkan community has chosen to use online technology to repatriate some of the widely dispersed content that forms part of its culture. Metadata about resources can be aggregated without the need to aggregate resources. Dublin Core (qualified), with its focus of resource discovery, has been chosen as one of the building blocks of the &#8216;virtual cultural institution&#8217;, the Quinkan Matchbox. Some of the resources to be repatriated are not yet identified. Others have been described according to a great variety of guidelines or to suit a variety of purposes. This research takes advantage of the modularity and extensibility of the Dublin Core architecture to develop a unifying metadata application profile (MAP) to describe the content of the Quinkan Matchbox. The profile must support the importation of records produced by a variety of intellectual communities with tolerable levels of loss. It must also reflect the Quinkan community&#8217;s view of cultural heritage, possibly through the addition of local usage elements, element refinements and vocabularies. The building of the Quinkan Matchbox is informed by the differing Western and Indigenous views on heritage. It places the preservation of Indigenous heritage through online networks and multi-media technology in the context of cultural globalisation, control over intellectual property and traditional modes of transmission of cultural knowledge. The design of a composite profile follows the Aggregation, Rationalisation, Harmonisation (ARH) framework (Currie et al., 2002). Following a review of a number of metadata standards used in the cultural heritage community, the draft application profile is assembled by aggregating, then rationalising metadata elements from Dublin Core with elements from other metadata element sets. Cataloguing of existing resources is used to test the MAP&#8217;s ability to accommodate the cataloguing practices of organisations holdings records of interest to the Quinkan community and to adjust the design of the profile in order to minimise loss or distortion. It is suggested that specialised, more granular MAPs could be developed to support specific purposes. The lack of insider&#8217;s knowledge of the culture profiled makes it difficult to evaluate whether the local refinements and vocabularies introduced reflects the contours and relief of the Quinkan cultural landscape. In the end, the MAP is to be regarded as one component of a large assembly of technical infrastructure, legal agreements and human resources that still remain to be built, validated and staffed. The relevance and usefulness of the Quinkan Matchbox as a cultural tool will be fully realised if it can be woven into cultural practices and assist the community in affirming its sense of identity.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1135/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1135/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Frontier conflict in the Bowen district, 1861-1874</field><field name="creator">Loos, N.

With sufficient research and development, sponge aquaculture is likely to supply demand while allowing the preservation of natural sponge stocks. However, due to the array of different environmental conditions found amongst the habitats of different species, and differences amongst the species themselves, detailed research on the amenability to common culture methods, survival and growth rates, recovery processes, and the environmental requirements for any one species is required before commercial culture may be considered. Furthermore, due to the diverse morphological variation that occurs in sponges due to the environment, quantitative quality testing protocols must be established to experimentally determine the optimal environmental conditions required for production of quality bath sponges. In this study, survival (in situ and in vitro), growth rates (in situ), and recovery processes (in vitro) were measured for two potential sponge aquaculture candidates, Rhopaloeides odorabile Thompson et al (1987) and Coscinoderma n. sp. [Phylum Porifera: Order Dictyoceratida Minchin (1900): Family Spongiidae Gray (1867)], cultured at the Palm Islands, central Great Barrier Reef. Sponge survival was dependent on species, culture method, and time with the highest mortality occurring soon after excision of sponge material from the parent stock. R. odorabile had the greatest survival of the two species in vitro, and the lowest survival in situ. Growth rates of 85.9 &#177; 23.7% and 115.2 &#177; 23.4% per annum, for R. odorabile and Coscinoderma n. sp. respectively, were not significantly different over the 21 month experimental period. Both species demonstrated initial size dependent growth rates with smaller explants growing fastest through the first season (78 days). Explant recovery rates were rapid for both species with a protective layer of collagen forming over the surface within 24hrs. This layer was later replaced by pinacoderm as the subsurface tissue was reorganised to recreate a functional surface including redevelopment of the aquiferous system. A quantitative testing protocol was developed to assess the quality of sponges using mechanical engineering techniques. Techniques quantified the directly measurable physical properties of sponges (density, fibre width, and fibre length) and the quality characteristics of firmness, compression modulus, compressive strength, tensile strength, elastic limit, elastic strain, modulus of elasticity, modulus of resilience, absorbency, and water retention efficiency. These were measured for R. odorabile and Coscinoderma n. sp. and three commercial species. There were significant differences between species for all quality parameters creating a unique profile for each species. R. odorabile was the firmest (37.8 &#177; 4.3kPa), strongest (157.4 &#177; 17.3kPa), and most rigid (838.7 &#177; 53.5kPa) species tested, while Coscinoderma n. sp. was one of the softest sponges (7.3 &#177; 1.1kPa) with the highest elastic energy (30.5 &#177; 3.5kJ/m3) and water retention efficiency (40.1 &#177; 1.4%) of all species tested. These quality tests enable comparisons of quality between and within species with scientific rigour. Comparisons between species may be used as a marketing tool to promote aquaculture products for specific applications. Within species testing will allow quantification of differences in quality caused by genetic or environmental factors. This research provides a foundation for the further research necessary to establish sponge aquaculture in Australia.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1145/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1145/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using phenomenology and action research to assist adults with hearing impairment to achieve positive life outcomes</field><field name="creator">MacDonald, Joseph Lee</field><field name="description">Progressive hearing impairment in adulthood is often accompanied by debilitating psychosocial problems including major disruptions to a person's ability to communicate orally. This research describes the story of how phenomenology and action research are employed in more visual ways with adults with degenerative hearing impairment in an attempt to enable them to accomplish more acceptable life outcomes. Descriptive analysis, in the form of dialogic, introspective and retrospective phenomenology, is used to capture a deep understanding of the pertinent life experiences of eight individuals who are hard of hearing. Individual action research case studies are then conducted with two members of the original sample. Information obtained from the descriptive analysis enables participants to identify a specific challenge to address in order to achieve a positive life outcome. The phenomenology-action research approach was found to be both suitable and effective for all individuals engaged in this study, particularly for those who completed the action research process. It is, therefore, recommended that further research and development be conducted into the collaborative use of this approach in which the rehabilitation professional works in close co-operation with the individual experiencing progressive hearing impairment to achieve more empowering and selfaffirming life goals.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1146/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1146/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A mechanistic approach to understanding and predicting hydrodynamic disturbance on coral reefs</field><field name="creator">Madin, Joshua Simon</field><field name="description">To understand and predict community dynamics in habitats where physical disturbance is a major cause of mortality, we must understand the frequency and intensity of these events, as well as their differential effects on the community&#8217;s structural species. Using a tropical coral reef as a study system, the aim of this thesis was to quantify the mechanical vulnerability of the habitat-forming structural species, scleractinian corals, and build a framework to estimate size- and species-specific mortality rates based on the return time and magnitude of hydrodynamic disturbances. To accomplish this aim, a geometric model and classical engineering theory were used to identify the factors upon which colony strength depends. These factors were 1) the tensile strength of the limiting material at the colony/substrate interface, 2) the projected shape of the colony perpendicular to water motion and 3) the maximum water velocity per wave cycle. To investigate the first of these factors, the strength of coral skeleton from three morphologically disparate species (submassive Acropora palifera [Subgenus Isopora], corymbose Acropora gemmifera and tabular Acropora hyacinthus) and the strength of the reef substrate were investigated spatially at a hydrodynamicallyexposed shallow reef platform (Lizard Island, Australia) to determine whether overall colony strength (i.e., a colony&#8217;s ability to withstand physical stress) is limited by skeletal strength or the reef substrate to which it is attached. To investigate the second factor, colonies of the three study species were photographed from the exposed reef crest along belt transects shoreward towards the relatively sheltered reef back and mechanically quantified using a novel technique for calculating the maximum predicted stress (MPS) at the base of a colony as a function of its projected shape for a given water velocity (MPS can be thought of as an objective quantification of mechanical vulnerability). Finally, to examine the third factor, a 37-year meteorological record of hourly wind conditions, in conjunction with a field-calibrated oceanographic modelling procedure, was used to comprehensively quantify maximum water motion (i.e., displacement, velocity and acceleration per wave cycle) on the study reef platform at scales ranging from seconds to decades and from metres to the entire reef. Using the measurements of each colony&#8217;s limiting strength (factor 1) and MPS (factor 2), the maximum water velocity that each colony is predicted to be able to withstand was calculated. The expected mortality rates of colonies from physical disturbances were calculated by fitting the exponential probability density function to the frequency distribution of times between wave events which produced maximum water velocity (per wave cycle; factor 3) greater than that which the colony is predicted to be able to withstand at a given location on the reef. The carbonate substrate of coral reefs served as the limiting factor to the strength of mechanically threatened coral reef colonies and raises the question of why corals invest resources into building skeletons that are stronger than mechanically necessary. The robust, submassive Acropora palifera has a significantly lower MPS than the corymbose Acropora gemmifera, which in turn has a significantly lower MPS than the competitively superior, yet more mechanically vulnerable, tabular Acropora hyacinthus. In addition to these inter-specific differences, these three species display distinctly different intra-specific patterns of MPS when examined with relation to colony size. Acropora palifera demonstrates approximately equal MPS values regardless of size, whereas Acropora gemmifera and Acropora hyacinthus become significantly more mechanically vulnerable with increased size. In addition, the lognormal distribution of MPS values of the mechanically inferior species, Acropora hyacinthus, was truncated at the reef crest, suggesting the imposition of a mechanical threshold by a recent hydrodynamic disturbance which caused colonies with an MPS above the threshold to have been dislodged from their position on the reef. Superimposition of the disturbance thresholds modelled from the meteorological record onto the three study populations illustrated that larger colonies of Acropora hyacinthus are indeed predicted to be mechanically removed at regular intervals from the reef at Lizard Island, and such removal regimes are predicted to occur in a manner consistent with present distributions of this species on the reef. Finally, estimated mortality rates for coral colonies in general (i.e., based on their MPS) vary significantly over the reef&#8217;s hydrodynamic gradient and suggest that a mechanical refuge exists approximately 40-60m back from the reef crest. This refuge is in addition to the expected refuges found at the reef base and reef back, each of which should theoretically promote mechanical, and therefore morphological, diversity. This study has developed a framework for which the change in community structure of scleractinian corals caused by recurrent physical disturbance can be estimated. Building on this framework will significantly enhance ecological understanding of the relationship between physical disturbance and biodiversity on coral reefs, and will facilitate the estimation of general future community changes resulting from changes in the intensity and frequency of physical disturbance that may be associated with global climate change.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1147/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1147/2/02chapters1-3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1147/3/03chapters4-6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1147/4/04appendices.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1147/5/05references.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sediment and nutrient dynamics in coastal intertidal seagrass of north eastern tropical Australia</field><field name="creator">Mellors, Jane Elizabeth</field><field name="description">In this thesis, I aimed to assess the interactions between the sediment structures and the nutrient environments of tropical seagrasses inhabiting intertidal meadows within the central region of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. I first surveyed 11 intertidal seagrass meadows and created an inventory of their sediment, nutrient, and seagrass parameters. This investigation revealed that the porewater nutrient environments of these meadows were low in a global context and below the critical values (60&#8211;100 &#956;M NH4 + and 10 &#956;M PO4 3-) that have been suggested as being limiting to seagrass growth. The biomass of these meadows was also low, with below ground biomass (roots and rhizomes) constituting the largest fraction (c. 60%) of the total biomass. In contrast, the concentration of plant tissue nutrients (%N and %P) recorded for Halodule uninervis and Halophila ovalis were higher than those (1.8%N and 0.2%P) calculated by Duarte (1990) as the thresholds distinguishing between seagrass meadows that would respond to nutrient enhancement from those meadows that would not. I then examined the following four aspects of the generally accepted views concerning seagrass ecosystem function for a variety of locations spanning &gt;500 km of coast: i) that the presence of seagrass regulates sediment structure and nutrient environment; ii) that the abundance of seagrass modifies sediment structure; ii) that seagrass abundance is affected by its sedimentary nutrient environment; and iv) that plant tissue nutrients reflect their sedimentary nutrient environment. I found that the presence of the structurally small seagrasses I examined did not regulate sediment structure and nutrients. Additionally at this scale, seagrass abundance did not appear to moderate sediment structure, or be influenced by sediment nutrient levels, which in turn were not reflected in the concentrations of plant tissue nutrients. The most salient outcome from these investigations was the significance of geographical location on the properties I studied, indicating the important influences of the local environment (physical, chemical and nutrient) on local populations of seagrass. The relationships between the abundance of the seagrass and the plant tissue nutrients to the sediment nutrients may have reflected the time of year (July, Southern Hemisphere winter) in which these investigations were undertaken. Consequently I examined intraannual variation within two locations to establish the effects of season on seagrass abundance, tissue nutrients, growth and sediment nutrients. I found that the ambient nutrient levels, seagrass abundance, plant tissue nutrients and plant growth parameters within the two Halophila ovalis meadows sampled, differed between the months selected to represent a seagrass senescent season and a growing season. In general, sediment nutrients were greater during the month representing the senescent season, whilst seagrass abundance and growth were greater during the month representing the growing season. With this knowledge, I designed an experiment that investigated the response of sediment nutrients and seagrass of the two Halophila ovalis meadows to additions of Osmocote&#174; fertilizer. These experiments highlighted the complexity of field experimentation because of the inability to control environmental parameters. Despite the positive and relatively consistent response of sediment nutrients to the additions of fertilizer, the response of Halophila ovalis varied according to location, season and experimental manipulation. Halophila ovalis at Bolger Bay (characterized by clay mineralogy) showed P limitations during the senescent season (August), with no significant response during the growing season (November). In contrast, Halophila ovalis at Picnic Bay (carbonate sediments), displayed no significant response to additional nutrients during the senescent season, but displayed primary N limitation with secondary P limitation during the growing season. The significant responses were relative to the experimental control and not the ambient field control, indicating the need to examine past experimental evidence in relation to how the fertilizer was added and the type of control used to compare the response. Overall, intertidal seagrass meadows that are characterized by structurally small species in this region do not conform to the generally accepted views on seagrass, sediment, and nutrient interactions. These tropical meadows are substantially influenced by seasonal cues. The predominant effect of location also indicates the importance of the local environmental/geographical history to which the seagrass meadow has been subjected. This result was highlighted by the nutrient enrichment, where the two different meadows displayed opposing patterns of nutrient limitation despite their proximity Overall my results suggest that a broad-brush management approach to the research and management of seagrass habitats in this dynamic and environmentally variable region is inappropriate.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1148/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1148/2/02chapters1-6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1148/3/03references.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1148/4/04appendices.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">With women, for women: a study of women's experiences as workers in feminist organisations</field><field name="creator">Miles, Debra Louise</field><field name="description">This thesis reports on a study of the experiences of women who work, paid and unpaid, in three feminist organisations. The research aims to identify the issues that impact on this experience and to particularly consider issues of difference and inclusion in feminist organisations. The research also aims to examine what strategies women use through their participation in feminist organisations to influence their own work experience. The thesis explores the assertions of the literature that discusses traditional organisational life and the role of organisations in social movements. The feminist critiques of each of these fields and the alternatives proposed are examined to provide background and context. This research employs a feminist qualitative methodology embedded within the theoretical framework of feminist standpoint. Data was primarily collected through semi structured interviews with twenty six women who worked with three different feminist organisations in Darwin, Northern Territory. The content of relevant organisational documentation was also analysed to enhance and provide context to the interview data. The findings presented in this thesis identify a number of significant issues which impact on women&#8217;s experience as workers in feminist organisations. Issues about structure and process are resolved by each organisation through informed, purposeful action that is relevant to their unique history and context, including the relationship of each organisation with the external political environment. Organisational strategies for attracting women from diverse backgrounds are experienced as not particularly successful, despite a collective and individual commitment to inclusion. A number of reasons for this are suggested including the limitations imposed by the white western definition of terms like &#8216;activism&#8217; and &#8216;exclusion&#8217;. Close, friendship based relationships with other women workers are identified as the most significant single element that influences women&#8217;s experience in feminist organisations. These relationships are understood by these women as simultaneously a source of pleasure and of pain. Undertaking work that &#8216;makes a difference&#8217; is also very important in the way women understand their experience. The thesis concludes that while working in feminist organisations is hard, demanding and potentially exploitative, the experience of these women is that being part of a feminist organisation is preferable to any other work environment and allows them an opportunity to pursue the political goals of the women&#8217;s movement even at times when feminism as an ideology is under siege or in abeyance.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1152/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1152/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The theology of freedom in Paradise Lost</field><field name="creator">Myers, Benjamin</field><field name="description">Milton scholarship remains divided between characterisations of Paradise Lost&#8217;s theology as either &#8220;orthodox&#8221; or &#8220;heretical.&#8221; In this study I situate Paradise Lost within its complex post-Reformation context, and I argue that its theology is more variegated and more elusive than either straightforwardly orthodox or straightforwardly heretical readings have tended to suggest. This study pursues the theological portrayal of freedom as it unfolds throughout Paradise Lost, and seeks to identify and explore the ways in which the poem&#8217;s theology is continuous and discontinuous with the major post-Reformation theological traditions. By teasing out the complexities of this theology and the distinctive manner in which it draws on diverse post-Reformation traditions, this study offers a nuanced reading of the poem which allows its theology to emerge clearly on its own terms. In particular, this reading of Paradise Lost highlights the poem&#8217;s profound commitment to both human and divine freedom. It is this commitment which underlies the poem&#8217;s appropriation and reformulation of a wide range of existing theological concepts in its unique and compelling account of the idea of freedom.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1157/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1157/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">One social worker&#8217;s snapshots: of students and poverty, a teaching tool and supervision</field><field name="creator">Nilsson, Deborah</field><field name="description">Social Work is far from &#8216;just&#8217; a job. How can it be when one of its paramount concerns is the pursuit of social justice? In the same vein, whatever social workers are involved with, they need to be able to examine their work in relation to how what they are doing contributes to a more socially just society. It is not enough to just do &#8216;the&#8217; job. Logically following on from this then, a social worker employed as a lecturer must act in ways that promote social justice &#8211; it is not enough to aim only to be a good lecturer or an effective teacher, for underlying these roles is that one is a social worker. The papers presented here describe some examples of one social worker&#8217;s attempts to apply the objectives of social justice in her work as a teacher in a university environment. This thesis is a portfolio of research papers and conference presentations. The common theme is students &#8211; in the higher education sector, in the classroom and in placements. The subthemes are social work and social work education. It is the work of a practitioner researching her practice and looking for ways to improve that practice. It is therefore applied research that is descriptive and qualitative in approach. Given the reflective research approach taken, some of the findings have been incorporated into teaching practices as part of the process. The success achieved in the application of some strategies, supports a recommendation for those involved in teaching and learning environments, to include a range of ways of cultivating the imagination of participants to enhance learning outcomes. Success also with a model of supervision which advocates the use of vision as a base for supervision, leads to a further recommendation for such an approach to be considered by workers and students wanting an egalitarian, cooperative, power sharing arrangement in supervision. Other findings such as the need for action to address student poverty and particularly when that poverty is exacerbated by the requirement of student placements, are matters for many stakeholders such as the professional associations, the universities, the government, the human services and agencies involved in placements, to address. One does need to strive to overcome unfairness caused by unequal access, to work towards upholding the rights of participants in a range of processes, to encourage others to reduce the barriers that prevent access to essential resources, and to foster active participation so that people have real opportunities to have a voice and be involved in decision making processes. The research demonstrates that it is both possible and necessary for a social worker in a teaching role to work in a myriad of ways that do this and in so doing work to promote social justice.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1161/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1161/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of ammonia toxicity on stream biota in north Queensland</field><field name="creator">Okelsrud, Asle</field><field name="description">Lethal and sublethal effects of ammonia toxicity to two north Australian fish species and one invertebrate species were investigated under laboratory conditions following the OECD guidelines for testing of chemicals. Acute toxicity was tested in a static nonrenewal system at pH 9.0 and temperature around 29 &#176;C. 96-hour LC50 values for the two fish species were 1.31 mg NH3 &#8211; N L-1 for barramundi (Lates calcarifer) and 1.99 mg NH3 &#8211; N L-1 for the eastern rainbowfish (Melanotaenia splendida splendida). The 96-hour LC50 value for freshwater shrimp (Caridina nilotica) was 1.53 mg NH3 &#8211; N L-1. The acute values indicate that barramundi, in particular, is sensitive to ammonia toxicity, comparable to salmonid species. Acute values for the freshwater shrimp suggest moderate sensitivity, given that invertebrates in general are more resistant to ammonia toxicity; the lethal values obtained were comparable to values reported for sensitive invertebrates. The acute values for rainbowfish indicated medium sensitivity, comparable to published values for a range of non-salmonids. There was no unequivocal evidence for gill damage resulting from acute ammonia exposure in the two fish species studied. Changes in gill structure in these fish are therefore not a strong indicator of exposure to short-term ammonia toxicity. A three-week postexposure experiment on surviving individuals from the acute toxicity test, in uncontaminated water, indicated that exposure to acute concentrations up to 1.5 mg NH3 &#8211; N L-1 did not have any significant effects on growth in either barramundi or rainbowfish. It was possible that this was a result of compensatory growth in higher concentrations.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1169/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1169/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Feasibility of Akoya pearl oyster culture in Queensland</field><field name="creator">Pit, Josiah Henk</field><field name="description">Pearl culture is the second largest aquaculture industry in terms of value in Australia. It is currently worth an estimated Aus$300 million annually and it is anticipated that the industry will be worth Aus$500 million by 2010. The Australian pearl industry is currently based on South Sea pearl production from the silver-lip pearl oyster, Pinctada maxima, for which it is world renowned. However, there has been recent interest in pearl production from two other major marine pearl oyster species, the blacklip pearl oyster, P. margaritifera, and the Akoya pearl oyster, P. fucata, which are both abundant in Australian waters.
 Production of Akoya pearls, until recently was dominated by the Japanese. However, recent down-scaling of the Japanese pearl oyster industry due to factors that resulted in the death of millions of oysters, has presented an opportunity for other countries to enter the Akoya pearl market. Australia is one such country which has received a lot of interest in Akoya pearl production over the last 5-10 years because of:
 (1) its reputation as a quality pearl producing nation;
 (2) the clean non-polluted waters around Australia; and
 (3) the wide distribution of Akoya oysters along the Australian coastline.
 Consequently, there was a need for biological information on which the feasibility of Akoya pearl oyster culture in Australia could be assessed. The major objective of the current project was to develop techniques to determine whether Akoya pearl oyster culture is feasible in tropical north Queensland. The results of this study will compliment the results of research with similar goals conducted in temperate Australia (New South Wales). The focus of this study was to produce Akoya pearl oysters in tropical Australia for the first time, before optimizing protocols for hatchery and nursery culture. This information was then utilized to suggest possible sites within Queensland which would be suitable for Akoya pearl oyster production, based on &#8216;biological performance&#8217;.
 The first successful culture of Akoya pearl oysters in Australia under tropical conditions produced 213 000 larvae which were transferred to settlement tanks. A total of 58 000 spat were subsequently transferred from settlement tank and resulted in
 48 000 spat ranging in size from 2-30 mm at 3.5 months of age. These spat were produced using established protocols for other pearl oyster species. After 12 months, Akoya pearl oysters had a mean dorso-ventral shell height (DVH) of 56.2 &#177; 0.2 mm and showed superior growth rate to those reported for this species in more traditional culture regions (i.e. SE Asia).
 This project investigated aspects of hatchery production including embryonic and larval development to identify optimal protocols for hatchery culture of Akoya pearl oysters (Chapters 4 and 5). Full orthogonal designs were established to investigate; (1) the effects of water temperature and salinity; and (2) the effects of density and addition of antibiotics on the development of P. fucata embryos into D-stage veligers. Maximum development of P. fucata embryos into D-stage veligers occurs within a water temperature range of 26-28&#176;C and a salinity range of 28-32&#8240;. Further results suggested that antibiotics are not required during embryonic development of P. fucata as development of larvae was not improved in the presence antibiotics. Results have also shown that maximum development of embryos into D-stage veliger occurred when larval stocking densities were low. Suggesting an ideal stocking density is strongly dependant on the individual hatchery and the production goals. These results have obvious implications for the selection of sites for an Akoya oyster hatchery in Queensland. Ideally, a site should be selected in which water parameters are within the above-mentioned ranges.
 A number of pearl oyster culture techniques were investigated during this project to optimise nursery culture of Akoya pearl oysters under Queensland (tropical) conditions. These included the effects of depth, stocking density, culture apparatus and fouling on the growth and survival of pearl oysters.
 P. fucata spat were transferred from the hatchery to the long-line and placed in plastic mesh trays at three different depths, 2 m, 4 m, and 6 m. After 8 weeks on the long-line, spat cultured at 2 m were significantly (p&lt;0.05) larger in DVH than spat at either 4 m or 6 m, which were not significantly different from each other. Additionally, greater numbers of &#8216;large&#8217; spat were recorded when spat cultured at 2 m compared to spat cultured at either 4 m or 6 m.
 Hatchery-produced P. fucata spat at 3.5 months of age were graded into three size classes, &#8216;small&#8217;, &#8216;medium&#8217; and &#8216;large&#8217;, which for the purpose of the study were treated as &#8216;slow&#8217;, &#8216;normal&#8217; and &#8216;fast&#8217; growers, respectively. This study aimed to determine whether growth rates differed between oysters from the above-mentioned size classes. Results from this study suggest that when oysters are first graded at 3.5 months of age (8 weeks after transfer to the ocean) slow growing oysters should not be discarded (common practice by some pearl farmers within the industry). This is because slow growers, when compared to &#8216;normal&#8217; growers, only require an additional 2-4 months before reaching pearl production size. The implications of retaining slow growers is discussed.
 Hatchery-produced spat were cultured at different stocking densities to determine optimal growth and survival of P. fucata. Stocking densities were determined on the basis of percentage of total available net area. In Experiment 1 during early nursery culture, spat were stocked at either 25%, 50% or 75% of total available net area. Maximum growth was recorded for spat cultured at the lowest stocking density (25% of total available net area), which were significantly larger that spat cultured at either 50% or 75% of total available net area. Furthermore, spat cultured at 25% of total available net area had significantly greater numbers of spat in the medium and large size classes than spat cultured at 50% or 75% total available net area. In Experiment 2 during late nursery culture, and based on the results from Experiment 1, spat were cultured at four stocking densities (20, 25, 30 and 40% of total available net area). Similar trends to those in Experiment 1 were recorded in Experiment 2 where spat cultured at the lower stocking densities were significantly larger than spat cultured at the other stocking densities. However, the overall growth performance (&#1060;&#8217;) was greatest in spat cultured at the highest stocking density (40% of total available net area). Survival was not significantly different between treatments.
 Two experiments were conducted with hatchery-produced P. fucata spat using four different culture units to determine which culture unit supported maximum growth and survival. In Experiment 1, the four treatments used were &#8216;box&#8217;, &#8216;tray&#8217;, &#8216;pearl net&#8217; and &#8216;pearl net with noodles&#8217;. While maximum growth, was recorded by oysters cultured in pearl nets, there was no significant difference in growth rate to oysters cultured in pearl nets with noodles; however, oysters cultured in the box treatment were significantly smaller than oysters in all other treatments. Survival of oysters in the box treatment was 47%, whereas, survival of spat cultured in the other three treatments was greater than 90%. In Experiment 2, the four treatments included &#8216;pearl net with small mesh&#8217;, &#8216;pearl net with large mesh&#8217;, &#8216;panel net with small mesh&#8217;, and &#8216;panel net with large mesh&#8217;. Maximum growth in terms of DVH was recorded for oysters cultured in panel nets with large mesh, followed by pearl nets with large mesh, pearl nets with small mesh and panel nets with small mesh. Survival was not significantly different between treatments, and all treatments recorded 85% or greater survival.
 Site did not affect growth and survival in the present study when P. fucata were cultured at Orpheus Island and Magnetic Island for 12 months. Although slight variations in water temperature, salinity and chlorophyll &#8216;a&#8217; were recorded between the two sites, no significant differences were recorded in overall oyster growth performance (&#1060;&#8217;) of 3.81 and 3.82 for Orpheus Island and Magnetic Island, respectively. Site selection for pearl oyster culture is important if growth and survival are to be maximised during nursery culture. Akoya pearl oysters showed positive growth at all water temperatures experienced throughout this study; however, the range at which optimal growth occurred was between 25.1-28.1&#176;C. Meanwhile, maximum growth occurred within salinity and chlorophyll &#8216;a&#8217; ranges of 29-33&#8240; and 3.5-5.3 &#956;g L-1, respectively.
 This project has produced biological information, which will provide a basis for the development of an Akoya pearl oyster industry in Queensland. Establishment of such an industry would compliment the current valuable pearl industry in Australia. While information generated during this study has answered a number of questions in terms of &#8216;biological performance&#8217; there is, however, a requirement for further research to appraise pearl production from Akoya oysters in Queensland and factors influencing pearl quality.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1170/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1170/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The environmental fate of traffic-derived metals in a section of Wet Tropics World Heritage Area (WTWHA), Far North Queensland (FNQ)</field><field name="creator">Pratt, Chris</field><field name="description">The major aim of this research was to resolve the following question: What are the key processes affecting the concentrations, mobility and bioavailability of traffic-derived metals (Cd, Cu, Pb, Ni, Zn, Pd and Pt) in roadside environments in a section of the wet-dry tropics in northern Australia? Specific areas investigated included the Kuranda Range Road, northwest of the city of Cairns; the Captain Cook Highway at the base of the Kuranda Range Road; and adjoining streams and grassed fields. The Kuranda Range Road traverses World Heritage-listed rainforest and the Queensland Department of Main Roads plans to upgrade the road from two lanes to four. Materials analysed in the study comprised bedrock, road sediments, road runoff waters, stream sediments, roadside topsoils, and grasses. Additionally, background stream sediment, stream water, topsoil and grass samples were collected away from roads. Geochemical analyses of the road sediments from the Kuranda Range Road revealed variable total metal concentrations (median values: 0.19 mg/kg Cd, 41.7 mg/kg Cu, 53.3 mg/kg Pb, 38.8 mg/kg Ni, 852 mg/kg Zn, 0.035 mg/kg Pd, 0.086 mg/kg Pt). Moreover, the studied road sediments exhibited metal enrichment (Ni excepted) relative to background stream sediments (maximum enrichment factors: Cd 1.8x, Cu 1.5x, Pb 6.8x, Zn 17.3x, Pd 49.5x, Pt 82x). Partial (citrate dithionite) and sequential (as per the method of Tessier et al. 1979) extractions were performed on the road sediments to examine their metal host sites. The results demonstrated that approximately 35 % to 95 % of the sediments&#8217; metal content was accommodated by acid (HF-HNO3-HClO4)-insoluble fractions, likely residual silicates. However, significant (p&lt;0.01) positive correlations between the Corg and Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn concentrations in the road sediments pointed to metal hosting by an organic source, most likely tyre rubber shreds. The extraction techniques revealed that metals associated with tyre rubber are not readily removed by extraction reagents. Hence, other methods, including correlation analyses between metal concentrations and Al, Mn, Fe and Corg values, are necessary to accurately interpret metal hosting within road sediments. Chemical analyses were performed to evaluate the mobility of Cd, Cu, Pb, Ni and Zn within road runoff waters on the Kuranda Range Road. Maximum Cu, Pb and Zn levels in filtered (&lt;0.45 &#956;m) road runoff waters taken in November 2004 (after a prolonged absence of rainfall) were 8x, 6x and 12x greater than their respective highest values in samples acquired in February 2003 and January 2004 (following heavy rainfall). Such temporal metal distribution data for road runoff waters suggest that large volumes of rainfall in wet-dry tropical regions are capable of mobilising high levels of metals from road surfaces during the initial flushing event (i.e. the &#8216;first flush&#8217;). Furthermore, laboratory leaching and ponding experiments conducted on road sediments indicated that a small proportion of the total heavy metal content (&lt;10 %) of road sediments is readily dissolved in distilled water. In the leach tests, aqueous Cd, Cu, Ni and Zn concentrations showed a pronounced &#8216;first flush&#8217; effect (i.e. metal values were much higher in the first few samples than in the remaining leachates). To explore the dispersion of metals from road surfaces, stream sediments from Avondale Creek (intersecting the Kuranda Range Road) were analysed for their total metal contents and Pb isotopic ratios (208Pb/206Pb, 207Pb/206Pb, 208Pb/204Pb and 206Pb/204Pb). The results revealed: a) elevated total Pb (29.6 mg/kg) and Pt (0.025 mg/kg) concentrations in the sediments collected downstream of the road compared to sediments upstream of the road (Pb = 7.3 mg/kg, Pt = 0.006 mg/kg); and b) non-radiogenic Pb isotopic signatures (characteristic of Broken Hill Pb used in petrol) in sediment samples downstream of roads relative to background stream sediments. The results likely reflect contamination of the catchment by road sources. The verification of metal contamination within Avondale Creek triggered an investigation into the bioavailability of traffic-derived metals. This involved an assessment of the uptake of soil-hosted metals by a grass species (Melinis repens), growing adjacent to the Kuranda Range Road. Median total metal concentrations in topsoils collected adjacent to the road were much higher than median total metal values in topsoils taken 5 metres from the road edge. In the M. repens grass specimens, Cu, Pb, Ni and especially Zn concentrations were elevated in roots acquired from immediately adjacent to the Kuranda Range Road. M. repens clearly has the ability to incorporate high concentrations of trace elements when growing on contaminated roadside soils, particularly Zn and to a lesser degree Cu, Pb and Ni. Additionally, extractions using a DTPA-CaCl2-TEA-HCl (DTPA) solution revealed a significant positive correlation (p&lt;0.01) between soil-DTPA and root Zn levels in the roadside M. repens samples. This indicates that the DTPA reagent is a rudimentary indicator of Zn to the roots of this grass species. Metal concentrations in M. repens samples grown in road sediments as part of a greenhouse experiment, were similar to the values exhibited by the field specimens. Moreover, the metal levels extracted from the road sediments by an EDTA-NH4HCO3 solution were commensurate with DTPA-extractable values, indicating that both of these solutions target similar metal fractions in road sediments. The final research phase examined remediation measures for road runoff waters on the planned Kuranda Range Road Upgrade. A treatment selection process identified dissolved metals as the most significant category of pollutants because of their high lability and potential toxicity. Site constraints, including the close proximity of the road to sensitive water catchments, indicated that at-source pollutant attenuation will be the most effective remediation option for the road upgrade. Thus, existing at-source primary treatment measures (e.g. trash racks); secondary technologies (including sand filters); and tertiary structures (such as biofilters) were identified as the most suitable treatment options for the Kuranda Range Road Upgrade. Few tertiary treatment devices exist for road runoff waters (the StormFilter is an exception). Hence, this research explored the capacity of commonly-available materials, including mushroom compost and bentonite, to remove dissolved metals from road sediment leachates. In laboratory experiments conducted in this project, mushroom compost and bentonite displayed strong capacities to reduce dissolved heavy metal concentrations in road sediment leachates (Pb and Zn removal over 80 %). Both materials were very fast-acting (&lt;5 minutes) in achieving metal attenuation. It is envisaged that these adsorptive materials have the potential to be included into structures (such as sand filter beds) that can achieve tertiary treatment of road runoff waters on the upgraded Kuranda Range Road. Overall, this research demonstrated that annual wet-dry climate cycles control the concentrations, mobility and bioavailability of traffic-derived metals in roadside corridors in the tropics. Metals accumulate in roadside sediments and soils during the prolonged &#8216;dry season&#8217; from April to October, and are mobilised by road runoff waters over the &#8216;wet season&#8217; (November to March). Mobile metals are bioavailable to organisms living adjacent to roads. Consequently, remediation strategies that can reduce the dispersal of these contaminants into natural environments are important in road design and maintenance in the tropics. The use of adsorptive materials such as bentonite in sand filter beds is presented as one such remediation option.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1171/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1171/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polyphase deformation and the structural controls on economic gold occurences within the Bendigo gold field, central Victoria, Australia</field><field name="creator">Raine, Matthew David</field><field name="description">The Bendigo Goldfield is historically the largest producing goldfield within the Lachlan Fold Belt of southeastern Australia, and is a classic example of a structurally controlled turbidite-hosted gold deposit. Since 1993, Bendigo Mining Ltd. has been re-evaluating part of the goldfield and is in the process of developing an underground mine. The current development, which accesses eight auriferous reefs to a depth of ~800 m, presents a unique opportunity to re-examine the structurally controlled reefs, which characterise the central Victorian goldfields. The identification of multiple foliations, both proximal and distal to the mineralisation, prompted a reinvestigation of the deformation chronology, which revealed that the structural evolution of the goldfield was more complex than previously thought. A five-stage deformation chronology (D1-D5) based primarily on the recognition of overprinting tectonic foliations (S1-S5) is proposed. D1 to D3 represent distinct, yet progressive phases of ENE-WSW shortening possibly during the Benambran Orogeny (ca. 439-435 Ma), with D2 corresponding to the peak of deformation and metamorphism. N-S directed shortening during D4 indicates that a change in the principal shortening axis has occurred and as such, D4 could represent the later stages of the Tabberabberan Orogeny (ca. 381-377 Ma). Deformation associated with D5 suggests a period of NNW-SSE directed shortening, which may correspond to the younger Kanimblan Orogeny (ca. 360-340 Ma). A period of deformation and fault reactivation that post-dates both D5 and Jurassic dykes has been recognised within the goldfield. However, the extent of this deformation remains unclear and no associated tectonic foliation has been observed. At Bendigo, economic occurrences of gold are intimately related to the structural evolution of the goldfield and are associated with late-stage mineral phases, which post-date the syn-D2 quartz veins such as the classic saddle reefs. On the basis of structural, microstructural and paragenetic observations it is proposed that the deposition of gold occurred during D3, and more specifically, in association with the development of D3 kink bands. The D3 kinks vary in size from small-scale kink bands (S3) on a millimetre-scale, through to large-scale kinks (F3) at a kilometre-scale. The small-scale D3 kink bands consist of four sets of conjugate extensional kinks, which exhibit an approximately orthorhombic symmetry about a sub-vertical axis, suggesting deformation in response to triaxial strain. Spatial analysis of historical production data has revealed a number of previously unrecognised high-grade trends. These trends coincide with the intersection axis between a kink band axial plane and bedding. It is proposed that these intersections control ore shoot geometry and location, because they also correspond to the orientation of historically worked ore shoots and those encountered more recently by Bendigo Mining Ltd. A new understanding of the controls on ore shoots has considerable implications for future exploration within the goldfield, and elsewhere in central Victoria.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1172/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1172/2/02sectionsA-B.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1172/3/03sectionsC-D.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1172/4/04references.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1172/5/05appendices.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Looking for Lovelace: identity, style and inheritance in the poetry of the interregnum</field><field name="creator">Reichardt, Dosia</field><field name="description">This thesis discusses the work of the Cavalier poet Richard Lovelace in two contexts in particular: first, within the political and cultural constraints operating during the period of the English Civil War and the Interregnum; second, against the background provided by the work of contemporary, often obscure, poets whose aesthetic and political attitudes help illuminate Lovelace&#8217;s own. The study examines a number of apparent paradoxes in the work and status of poets in Lovelace&#8217;s milieu. The desire to fashion an individual and lasting literary persona in the mould of Ben Jonson, for example, conflicts with the practice of circulating essentially un-authored lyrics within an educated and exclusive male coterie. Lovelace&#8217;s amatory verse is viewed through the prism of contemporary attitudes towards female constancy, but also through seventeenth-century poets&#8217; habitual borrowings from Latin and Greek sources. Lovelace&#8217;s attempt at a lengthy pastoral partakes of the cultural poetics of nostalgia for a vanished Court and the genres associated with it. His interest in music and the fine arts inspires many poems which comment on contemporary politics while participating in an immemorial debate about art and artificiality versus nature. His prison and drinking songs have earned him a place in anthologies of poetry as a minor classic, but they also crystallize a conjunction of genres peculiar to the years between 1640 and 1660. The thesis draws on much unpublished material and on rare early books and pamphlets, and hopes to provide an unprecedented sense of Lovelace&#8217;s creative conditions. Recovering Lovelace&#8217;s verse as much as possible in the context of his contemporary admirers, imitators, influences, and readers brings to the fore the intense intertextuality of seventeenth-century poetry generally speaking, but also illustrates the ways in which poets transcended those &#8220;trans-shifting times&#8221; of political and religious unrest.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1173/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1173/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of insect leaf herbivory on the mangroves Avicennia marina and Rhizophora stylosa</field><field name="creator">Burrows, Damien Wayne</field><field name="description">This thesis examines insect leaf herbivory and the insect herbivore community on two common mangrove species &#8211; Avicennia marina and Rhizophora stylosa, at two sites near Townsville, northern Queensland. Despite its widely recognised importance in other forested ecosystems, the role of insect herbivory in mangrove ecosystems is often downplayed and remains relatively unexplored. It is generally considered that mangroves lack a diverse and specialised insect herbivore fauna, and are populated with insects from adjoining habitats. It is also commonly believed that mangrove leaves are less palatable and nutritious than leaves of other tree species, and that herbivory levels are less than those found in other forest ecosystems. Sixty-one insect species were confirmed feeding upon A. marina and R. stylosa at the study sites, more than doubling the number of published host records for Australian mangroves. Herbivore diversity on the two mangrove species was similar, but only four of the 61 herbivore species were in common between them and the composition of the two faunas was substantially different. The two faunas show a high degree of host-specificity and adaptation to their mangrove hosts and there were substantial similarities between the faunas found in this study and those of other Avicennia and Rhizophora species elsewhere in the world. The diversity of folivores on these two mangrove species was similar to that of other nearby non-mangrove trees and to that reported for other trees elsewhere in the tropics. Nearly all mangrove herbivory studies have measured damage on discrete leaf samples collected at one point in time. This approach fails to detect entirely consumed leaves, or partly damaged leaves that have been abscised. These leaves can be accounted for by an alternative long-term method that makes repeated herbivory estimates on tagged leaves. Application of the long-term method in this study found herbivory to be 3-6 times higher than estimated by discrete measurements. R. stylosa had only 2-3% loss of leaf area in discrete samples but 7-13% loss in the long-term study. A. marina had 6-7% loss of leaf area in discrete samples but 28-36% loss in the long-term study. For both species, most herbivory occurred whilst the leaves were young. Once past the juvenile phase, R. stylosa leaves were rarely attacked. In contrast, mature A. marina leaves suffered significant insect damage and leaf loss. Herbivory reduced average leaf longevity of all leaves by 4-5% for R. stylosa and 12-13% for A. marina. In mangroves, loss of entire leaves is reported to be rare, but in R. stylosa and A. marina in this study, 4-5% and 19-29% of leaves, respectively, were either entirely consumed, or aborted due to insect damage. For both species, loss of leaf material through premature abscission of damaged leaves was as great as that actually consumed by insects, indicating a role for herbivory in promoting leaf fall. Destruction of developing leaf buds by insects resulted in greater leaf losses than that suffered by emerged leaves. This was especially important for R. stylosa, which can only produce leaves from the apical bud. Damage to R. stylosa apical buds was common, frequently resulting in the loss of leaves before they emerged or, where damage resulted in the destruction of the apical bud, cessation of leaf production and death of that shoot. In some cases, new apical buds regenerated from suppressed lateral buds immediately below the destroyed apical bud. Death of existing shoots and regeneration from suppressed laterals are potentially major sources of architectural change to tree growth form. Damage to apical buds also resulted in the loss of developing inflorescences and lateral branches. The chemical and physical nature of leaves changed significantly as they aged. Young leaves had a higher nutrient and chlorophyll concentration, but lower leaf thickness and leaf mass per unit area. Thus they were more nutritious and less tough for herbivores. These young leaves were especially prone to premature leaf fall because of insect damage. Leaves re-translocated over half of their nutrients prior to senescence but consumption or premature abscission of leaves before this process is complete may increase nutrient loss from the trees to microbial and detrital food chains on the forest floor. Thus herbivore-mediated leaf fall may also impact upon nutrient dynamics in mangrove forests. This thesis demonstrates that: mangroves support a diverse and distinctive insect herbivore community; leaf herbivory is much higher than previously reported; there are additional mechanisms (eg, apical bud damage) by which herbivores affect leaf loss and other aspects of tree performance; and insects significantly affect leaf longevity, the timing of leaf fall and the quality of leaf litter. These results indicate that the role of herbivorous insects in mangrove ecosystems is more important than previously thought and that its evaluation needs to go well beyond simple static measures of leaf area missing from mature leaves.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1174/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1174/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Participation in physics and rigorous mathematics and a consideration of educational, economic and political influences</field><field name="creator">Ridd, John Cyril</field><field name="description">In this thesis the level of participation in Physics and the allied discipline of rigorous Mathematics at Tertiary and upper Secondary level is examined. Various possible supply side constraints are considered, in particular the condition of Maths and Physics in lower Secondary schools in Queensland. Some of the effects of weak Maths and Physics in that part of the education chain are examined indicating that there is a commonality of interest between many school students, especially males, and the disciplines per se. Participation in Physics at Tertiary level is in decline in USA, Canada and Germany as well as in Australia. There are indications from both Germany and USA that those declines are not entirely explicable by a consideration of demand side influences, supply side factors must have some influence. Because it may be possible to manipulate supply side influences, the work reported here concentrates on those issues, in particular in Queensland. Participation in Physics and especially rigorous Mathematics in the last two years of Secondary schooling has been in medium to long term decline across Australia. In Queensland that decline is mainly a decline in male participation. The student decisions not to study those subjects are made at the end of Year 10. Hence their educational experiences prior to that time are important. Clear evidence is presented from a large sample of school Principals in Queensland that there is a high degree of concern in the schools about the condition of both Mathematics and Science in Years 8,9 and 10. An inappropriate structure of relevant Statutory Authorities in Queensland has led to there having been no collection for 15 years of data vis-&#224;-vis student outcomes up to the end of year 10. The only exception being a single but excellent study for Mathematics that showed that outcomes are highly variable and frequently weak, particularly for algebra. For physical Science there is no data but indications from textbooks are that very little numerical Science is studied. Hence there is a discontinuity at the Year10/11 interface. It is known that participation in the physical Sciences is highly dependent on previous educational experiences. The discontinuity referred to will affect participation in Physics and Maths C, the most rigorous Mathematics in Queensland at the Year11/12 levels. An analysis of effects on student Overall Position (the equivalent of ENTER) consequent to the concurrent study of Maths B, Maths C and Physics shows that students are advantaged in OP terms by that concurrent study. Hence the decision by an increasing number of capable students not to take those subjects may have a deleterious effect on their final outcomes. A survey of students from five North Queensland schools confirms that students who are taking Maths B/Maths C/Physics are comfortable with it and recognise that it has been to their advantage. Another part of that survey demonstrates a degree of ignorance about both Physics and Maths C amongst the Year 10 students at the time that they are making their subject selections. It is noteworthy that the advantage gained by taking the combination Maths B, Maths C and Physics is at least as noticeable for males as for females. Consequently it is an area of comparative advantage for males. An examination of male/female performance in rigorous Mathematics and numerical Science across the whole state demonstrates that, contrary to received wisdom, females are not performing better than males of similar general ability or have relatively improved their performance over the last decade at least. It is suggested that a major overhaul of both Mathematics and physical Sciences in lower Secondary schools in Queensland is required. Such an improvement would tend to raise participation levels in both Physics and rigorous Mathematics to the advantage of many students, particularly males and provide a larger pool of qualified students from which Tertiary physical Science and Engineering Departments could draw. The condition of both Mathematics and physical Sciences in Years 8/9/10 is at best highly variable, at worst poor, to the detriment of many thousands of students and the related disciplines Mathematics and Physics. It is suggested that Parliament, the Statutory bodies, schools and Tertiary Education Faculties need to accept that a problem exists, accept a part of the responsibility for that problem and act decisively to rectify the situation.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1176/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1176/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ability of gender to challenge: Queensland senior physical education</field><field name="creator">Walls, Gillian Sandra Rachel</field><field name="description">Previous research in physical education has historically focussed on the gender issues of single-sex and coeducation, however discussion on alternate groupings of students, is not as significantly discussed. Ability is a factor that has also been infrequently dealt with in this examination. This doctoral research explored from the students&#8217; perspectives, the class habitus of single-sex and coeducational Senior Physical Education classes in three North Queensland regional Catholic High schools. This research considered the factor of ability in single-sex and coeducation practical physical education learning environments, and the homogeneous groupings of single-sex schooling alongside a coeducation setting. It did this by examining the relationship of the themes of ability, challenge and gender, which were identified and incorporated into the study&#8217;s multidimensional methodological framework using the dimensions of Ability, Individual and Environment. It was hypothesised that gender, ability and the learning environment could affect an individual&#8217;s experiences, perceptions and sense of level of challenge experienced within the physical education environment. Participants were (N) 117, n = 78 male and n = 39 female, year 11 students enrolled in an elective Queensland Senior Physical Education subject. A case study method was utilised allowing for the triangulation of the qualitative and quantitative data. Quantitative instruments were trialled in a Pilot study and found appropriate for use in the case study methodology. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected over the duration of a study unit which involved an interceptive, team, ball physical activity. Data collection techniques employed were those of survey, observation and interview. The data analysis revealed that ability was a significant factor in Senior Physical Education learning environments. However, the findings of this research did not reveal gender as a significant factor in the same learning environments. Student perceptions of issues of ability, challenge and equity in the class habitus were both quantitatively and qualitatively linked to ability. Implications of the preliminary findings of this research for grouping students in Senior Physical Education classes indicate issues of equity relating to grouping students based upon ability and gender with the recommendation that further research be undertaken to examine such issues.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1177/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1177/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microprobe dating of monazite in relation to porphyroblast growth and thermodynamic modelling P-T paths for rocks affected by prolonged orogenesis</field><field name="creator">Welch, Peter W.</field><field name="description">Pressure-Temperature-time-deformation paths were modelled using microstructural, petrologic, geochronologic data for multiply deformed Acadian metamorphic rocks currently exposed within and mantling the Chester and Athens Domes in southeastern Vermont, USA. Estimates of pressure, temperature and time were obtained for samples where the relative timing of distinct periods of garnet growth has been previously established through detailed microstructural analysis of foliation intersection axes (FIAs) of inclusion trails in garnet porphyroblast. Compositional mapping and in-situ microprobe analyses of monazite grains reveal that monazite growth was the result a series of reactions or growth events. Numerous monazite grains preserve complex compositional zoning patterns that cannot be easily explained by a single monazite growth event. Electron microprobe point analyses of U, Th, Pb and Y were used to determine the ages of monazite grains or distinct compositional domains within monazite grains. U-Th-Pb age distributions show monazite growth and subsequent metamorphism occurred over a period at least 80 m.y from 430 Ma to 350 Ma. A single sample was found to contain distinct populations when monazites where grouped by microstructural affinities. A single sample yielded ages of 424 &#177; 2.4 Ma, 405 &#177; 6.0 Ma, 386 &#177; 6.0 Ma, 366 &#177; 3.8 for monazite populations analysed in the cores, medians, and rims of garnet porphyroblasts and matrix respectively. Weighted averages calculated for monazite populations, which lie within the included/overgrown foliations for all of the samples clustered around 425 Ma, 405, Ma, 387 Ma, 377, Ma and 365 Ma and 350 Ma. These age distributions are taken to represent a best estimate of the timing of deformation and accompanying mineral growth for southeastern Vermont. P-T pseudosections were utilised to map mineral reactions for samples that contain garnet porphyroblasts with inclusion mineralogies that reveal partial mineral assemblages prior to garnet growth. Pseudosections were modelled in the system MnKFMASH for high-Al pelites and MnNCKFMASH for low-Al pelites and calcpelites. Thermobarometric calculations were compared with P-T pseudosections to construct P-T paths consistent with observed mineral reactions. P-T estimates for garnet cores are consistent with the position of garnet-in reactions on MnKFMASH pseudosections and are generally 25-50&#176;C above the garnet-in reaction on the MnNCKFMASH pseudosections. P-T estimates for garnet cores reveal that garnet growth commenced at &#170; 525&#176;C and moderate pressure (4-9 kbars) and proceeded along an up-pressure path reaching peak pressures between 13-14 kbars at 600-625&#176;C. Monazite inclusions in garnet porphyroblasts bracket the timing of the onset of garnet growth between 425 Ma and 405 Ma. Peak pressure, which is estimated to have occurred at &#170; 600&#176;C, was likely reached by 385 Ma. Peak temperatures of &#170; 650&#176;C are recorded between 11-12 kbars, which was followed by decompression and cooling. Decompression occurred between 380 and 350 Ma with very little heating indicating that initial uplift and subsequently exhumation was rapid. Monazite ages from garnet rims and matrix mark the end deformation and mineral growth at 350 Ma. Previous tectonic models for Acadian orogenesis for the region have suggested that deformation and accompanying metamorphism was a two-stage process. Crustal thickening was thought to be the result of nappe style thrusting followed by regional scale doming. The integration of microstructural studies and in-situ monazite dating along with a detailed evaluation of the thermobarometric history reveals a more complex deformation and metamorphic history. The peak pressures and relatively low geothermal gradients associated with the early part of the P-T path are more consistent with subduction related tectonism than nappe style thrusting. Inclusion trails in garnet porphyroblasts also reveal that numerous near orthogonal foliations formed during garnet growth that cannot be easily explained by nappe and dome stage deformations. In the proposed model, foliation development and subsequent mineral growth occurs in response to crustal thickening related to continental subduction. This resulted in a greatly over-thickened crust that was unstable and underwent rapid uplift and exhumation with little heating. Monazite ages that have been linked directly with microstructures and mineral growth reveal that Acadian Orogenesis may have begun as early as the earliest Silurian and continued through to the Carboniferous.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1178/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1178/2/02chapter1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1178/3/03figures1-8chapter1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1178/4/04tables1-4chapter1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1178/5/05figures9-17chapter1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1178/6/06chapter2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1178/7/07figures1-5chapter2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1178/8/08figures6-9chapter2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1178/9/09tables1-2chapter2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1178/10/10figures10-17chapter2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1178/11/11chapter3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1178/12/12figures1-5chapter3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1178/13/13figures6-10chapter3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1178/14/14tables1-4chapter3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1178/15/15figures11-17chapter3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1178/16/16chapter4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1178/17/17figures1-5chapter4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1178/18/18figures6-9chapter4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1178/19/19tables1-5chapter4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1178/20/20figures10-16chapter4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1178/21/21appendices.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ideas and identities: representations of Australian public universities</field><field name="creator">Westerhuis, Diane Solomon</field><field name="description">This thesis is a critical and discursive analysis of Australian public universities from a normative perspective, based on a commitment to values of social justice and equality.
 I argue that ideas of universities in Australia have changed over time; that there were two major shifts of ideas since the liberal ideas that were apparent with the foundation of Australia's first university. Different ideas dominated in the 1970s when ideas of universities are described as egalitarian and democratic, but these ideas of universities changed again with reconstruction of Australian public universities in 1988. In the last two decades Australian public universities have been based on ideas that have produced different institutions, described as neoliberal, marketised and, in effect, privatised.
 These neoliberal ideas privilege the economic over the social. I argue for a preferred model of equal rights based on citizenship and merit, which includes free access to a higher education in a public university.
 The data that are analysed are policy texts, speeches and university mission statements that are representations of identity and agency. This is a critical analysis in which themes and concepts are identified in discourse that represents universities at different times, for example in the speech for the founding of the University of Sydney by Wentworth in 1849, or a speech by Whitlam in 1972 which describes the ideas of universities as free and access based on ability.
 However, representations in contemporary mission statements and policy texts illustrate that the identities of Australian public universities have shifted. Findings include themes in texts of transformed relations, actors and communities, and mechanisms and strategies that illustrate changed practices, such as commercialisation, internationalisation and, most significantly, privatisation of Australian public universities. Australian public, not-for-profit universities have become more commercial than their predecessors, undertaking different activities, more governed yet in contradiction more flexible and shape-shifting. Specific neoliberal characteristics and strategies are now evident in their discourse and in practices. These neoliberal characteristics and strategies cross domains and operate at different levels, and in combination they achieve the hegemonic neoliberal project of the state. The consequences are that these neoliberal ideas have reshaped Australian universities.
 Australian universities have become altered commercial and international actors in disparate networks and different market relationships. Reflexive Australian universities are very successful in these markets, and take on a marketised, private identity. The mechanisms of this are in place, but the effects are still to be proclaimed. There will, in the future, be no Australian public universities. A normative alternative is offered.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1179/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1179/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning from mothers: how myths, policies and practices affect the early detection of subtle developmental problems in children</field><field name="creator">Williams, Jane</field><field name="description">Background.  Recent research has revealed increasing concerns over the number of children entering school with unidentified developmental problems even though there are seemingly comprehensive health services available for mothers and their children in the pre-school years. Recognising that early detection and early intervention reduces the likelihood of long-term serious health and educational problems, it is important to understand why so many children have not been detected with developmental problems in their pre-school years. Utilising the knowledge and experience of mothers&#8217; whose children had not been diagnosed with developmental delay until school age, this study draws attention to reasons how and why children with subtle developmental problems &#8216;slipped through the net&#8217;. Research Question.  What can be learned from the mothers&#8217; experiences of their child&#8217;s development that will contribute to improving the early detection of subtle developmental problems in children? Aims.  This study had four specific aims: (1) to document mothers&#8217; stories about their experiences of raising a child with developmental problems that remained undiagnosed until school; (2) to ascertain the extent to which mothers&#8217; were &#8216;aware&#8217; of developmental problems with their child prior to school entry; (3) to determine the environmental characteristics associated with parent&#8217;s experiences and their interpretation of these experiences and, (4) to ascertain ways in which child health professionals may utilise the experience of parents to improve early recognition and diagnosis of subtle developmental and behavioural problems in children. Theoretical framework, methodology &amp; method.  Recognising that parenting does not occur in a vacuum, but is influenced by the immediate surrounds, the community and the larger socio-economic, cultural, political and historical environments, a social constructionist perspective was utilised as the framework for this research. A synthesis of interpretive biography and literary folkloristics provided a method of collecting, reading and interpreting the life stories of mothers whose children had not been detected with developmental problems until school age. The life stories were obtained through individual, in-depth interviews of eight mothers who lived in the North Queensland region of Australia, and were read through the lens of three literary theories, arising respectively from the tenets of semiotics, neoMarxism and Foucauldian poststructuralism. Findings &amp; Conclusions.  Findings draw attention to a number of factors that influence the interaction between mothers, health professionals and community members and how these impact on early detection of children&#8217;s developmental problems: &#8226; competing messages about motherhood affect how mother&#8217;s decide on the best course of action when concerned about their children; &#8226; societal myths influence how mothers and health professionals view their roles, the child&#8217;s problem and subsequent action; &#8226; health professionals&#8217; knowledge is valued over mothers&#8217; knowledge; &#8226; expectations of the role of the health professional, influenced by mythical ideals and ideological notions, differ between mothers and health professionals; &#8226; communication between health professionals and mothers is distorted due to different approaches to language and understanding; &#8226; competing arguments about the value of diagnosis and labelling delay identification and access to assistance programmes for their children; &#8226; a medical diagnosis plays an important role in how support and assistance is determined. Significance.  This research has raised awareness of constraining social, historical and political factors on how mothers and health professionals interact, and the effect this has on the early detection of childhood developmental problems. Bringing these constraints to the attention of health professionals working with mothers and their young children will hopefully encourage active engagement with parents and the acknowledgement that health professionals and parents can work together to improve the early detection of developmental problems in children.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1180/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1180/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">This is our life, this is our child: mothers dancing in the margins of disability</field><field name="creator">Ypinazar, Valmae Anne</field><field name="description">This study examines the narratives of 15 mothers who each have (or had) a child who is medically, educationally and socio-culturally constituted as having a disability. This research interrogates the mothers&#8217; narratives to consider motherhood from the discursive multiple position/ings of the society in which they live. The central research questions are: What are the lived experiences of these women who have a child who does not fit the dominant socio-cultural expectation of a 'normal' child? What subject positions are available for these women? How do they position themselves and how are they positioned in multiple discursive sites such as medicine and education? By drawing on multiple methodological frames, the study explores the lived experiences and meanings as these mothers (re)construct the discourse of motherhood. Qualitative methods were used to design the research and gather data. Poststructural and feminist perspectives are added to provide additional methods of data analysis. Poststructuralist theorisings are considered new to the field of disability studies and hence provide an opportunity to re-examine subjectivity, power/knowledge and agency in fresh ways, as various mothers in this study reject, (re)construct and even rupture dominant nondisabled assumptions not only of disability, but also of motherhood. The women&#8217;s narratives transverse multiple discursive sites but particular attention is paid to medical and educational discourses and the complex interplay of relations of power constituted with/in these sites. The outcome of analysis suggests many women with a child with a disability actively take up the subject position of 'good mother' in keeping with the dominant discourse and ideology of motherhood available in Western society and (re)construct their lives as 'normal', while simultaneously encountering societal and attitudinal barriers which continue to marginalise their child named with a disability and by association, their families. Professionals can do much to dismantle barriers encountered by these mothers and work collaboratively to ensure inclusive life experiences are available. This thesis adds to the body of literature in disability studies by adding new forms of analysis of the interaction between the lived experiences of mothers and society, serving to challenge Western socio-cultural ways of &#8216;knowing&#8217; about the intersection of motherhood and disability.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1181/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1181/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Systematics, biogeography and functional morphology of the Box Crabs (Family Calappidae)</field><field name="creator">Bellwood, Orpha</field><field name="description">The box crabs (family Calappidae, H. Milne Edwards 1837) are a morphologically and ecologically distinctive group of marine crabs found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Traditionally placed in the section Oxystomata because of their characteristic triangular buccal frame (the 'oxystomatous' condition), they are one of the few brachyuran families capable of burying completely in soft substrata. This study aims to review the systematics of the family and to examine the phylogenetic and functional implications of the oxystomatous condition in an evolutionary and biogeographic framework. The systematic status of the family Calappidae and the phylogenetic relationships of its four component subfamilies were re-evaluated based on a cladistic analysis of 78 adult morphological characters. A single tree was produced (CI = 0.654, RCI= 0.403). The monophyly of the Calappidae sensu lato is rejected. Yet the monophyly of each subfamily is supported, with the Calappinae clearly defined by 13 autapomorphies and the Matutinae and Orithyiinae well-defined by 6 and 5 autoapomorphies. respectively. Only the Hepatinae appears to be a relatively weakly-defined taxon supported by 1 autapomorphy. The data also suggest that the Calappinae and Hepatinae form a single lineage which is closer to some xanthids than to the Matutinae or Orithyiinae. A close link between the Matutinae and some leucosiids and between the Orithyiinae and some dorippids is also apparent, with a suggestion that these four taxa all belong to a single lineage. A revised classification of the Oxystomata emend. and Calappidae sensu strict0 is proposed. The phylogenetic relationships of 8 genera within the Calappidae sensu strict0 were further examined based on a cladistic analysis of 55 adult morphological characters. A single tree was produced (CF0.833, RCI=0.717). The data revealed two major lineages within the Calappidae: the 'calappine' clade consisting of Calappa, Cryptosoma, Cycloes, Paracyclois and Cyclozodion, and the 'mursiine' clade consisting of Acanthocarpus, Mursia and Platymera. Analyses of the fossil record and biogeographic patterns point to vicariance events associated with Gondwanan fragmentation. The earliest fossil record of the group suggest that present-day genera were already established by the Oligocene. Optimization of depth distributions on the cladogram indicates that the family initially diversified in deep water. Of the 10 genera, only three have a significant proportion of species recorded in waters less than 50 m: Calappa, Cycloes and Cryptosoma. All three genera comprise a single crown-group clade. The remaining genera are largely restricted to water between 100 and 300m deep. This suggests that the family had deep-water origins with only a single, derived, lineage moving into shallow waters. An evaluation of existing evidence reveals two distinct means of concealment within the substratum in Brachyura: burrowing and burying. There are fundamental differences between the two types of behaviour, both in terms of ecological, mechanical and physiological implications. The oxystomatous condition was found to be primarily associated with burying crabs. The functional basis of the oxystomatous condition and its role in the burying habit was evaluated, based on two distinct forms within the Calappidae sensu lato: Calappa and Matuta. Although the morphology of the respiratory system of both taxa follow the typical brachyuran pattern, Calappa and Matuta both possess two unusual modifications which appear to be associated with their burying habit: accessory inhalant channels and elongate exhalant channels. Video analyses demonstrated that both taxa enter the substratum backwards, within seconds, at relatively steep angles. Both taxa are capable of burying completely within the substratum for extended periods of time while maintaining contact with overlaying water at the surface. Matuta is unusual in that it is also capable of complete deep burial. Dye tracer studies show that ventilation patterns in both taxa are broadly similar and confirm the function of the accessory inhalant channels as the primary inhalant pathway. Both Calappa and Matuta ventilate their branchial chambers in the normal forward pattern and do not rely on prolonged reversed ventilation even when buried under the sediment. This is unique within Brachyura and is found only in one other family, the Leucosiidae, another oxystomatous group also characterized by accessory inhalant channels. It is hypothesized that the role of the oxystomatous configuration of the exhalant channels enhances the efficiency of the accessory inhalant channels. It serves to separate the inhalant and exhalant currents by dispersing the exhalant stream with sufficient force so as to prevent re-mixing, as well as creating a suction effect via the Bernoulli principle which facilitates the movement of fresh oxygenated water into the vicinity of the inhalant openings. In summary, this study demonstrates that the Calappidae sensu lato is not a monophyletic, natural, group and that component taxa exhibit a clear evidence of convergent evolution. The oxystomatous condition, on which traditional groupings have long been based, has no phylogenetic basis and appears to have arisen independently in a number of lineages. In most lineages, however, the evolution of the oxystomatous condition appears to be closely associated with respiration whilst buried in soft substrata. The oxystomatous condition therefore is a functional not a systematic characteristic.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1182/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1182/2/02chapters1-3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1182/3/03chapters4-5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1182/4/04references.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1182/5/05appendices.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of image measurement and continuum mechanics to measuring the large-strain kinematic behaviour of prepared sugar cane and bagasse</field><field name="creator">Britton, Paul Falcon</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an investigation into the application of numerical image measurement techniques and fundamental continuum mechanics to measurement of the large strain kinematic behaviour of prepared sugar cane and bagasse. A generic, stand&#339;alone software tool was created for measuring the two&#339;dimensional finite strains of solid&#339;phase historic continua, via time series of digital images from filmed experiments. This software, referred to for simplicity as Image Tensor Analysis (ITA), combines numerical image displacement measurement using the FFT direct cross&#339;correlation, with the classical theory of continuum mechanics, to produce transient kinematic and material output that is concurrent with Lagrangian finite element models. The ITA software presents a new platform for data acquisition from prepared cane and bagasse experiments, as well as providing a means for proofing finite element simulations of bagasse milling. Furthermore, the accurate measurement of fibre kinematics, coupled with mechanical data, provides sufficient information for estimating parameter values within the solid&#339;phase material model, with a reverse finite element procedure. A small series of confined flat&#339;platen uniaxial compression experiments were conducted and the ITA software was calibrated for the complex fibro&#339;porous process materials, prepared sugar cane and bagasse. Problems with experimental procedures were identified and a subsequent series of experiments conducted. Refined experimental practice resulted in improved initial sample homogeneity and repeatable sample deformation measurements. The ITA software was also employed in an investigation into bagasse behaviour during compression between grooved surfaces, providing insight into juice flow through the bagasse fibre blanket. A series of two&#339;roll milling experiments were conducted, with the aim of quantifying the deformation behaviour of prepared cane and bagasse during rolling. The experiments were inhibited by apparatus limitations, resulting in poor repetition of the deformation measurements. However, the ITA software was shown to be capable of measuring the large biaxial material strains, and solid conclusions were made in regard to the kinematic behaviour of the solid&#339;phase fibre. It was identified that improved apparatus is required to obtain suitable ITA deformation results for direct comparison with finite element simulations of the two&#339;roll milling regime.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1183/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1183/2/02chapters1-2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1183/3/03chapter3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1183/4/04chapter4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1183/5/05chapters5-6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1183/6/06references.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1183/7/07appendices.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Guiding linear deductions with semantics</field><field name="creator">Brown, Marianne Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Guidance is a central issue in Automatic Theorem Proving systems due to the enormity of the search space that these systems navigate. Semantic guidance uses semantic information to direct the path an ATP system takes through the search space. The use of semantic information is potentially more powerful than syntactic information for guidance. This research aimed to discover a method for incorporating semantic guidance into linear deduction systems, in particular model elimination based linear systems. This has been achieved. The GLiDeS pruning strategy is a simple strategy of restricting the model elimination deduction to one where all A-literals are false in the guiding model. This can be easily incorporated into any model elimination based prover. Evaluation of the GLiDeS strategy has shown that when &#8220;good guidance&#8221; has been achieved, the benefit of this guidance is significant.

Co-varying traits provide the basis for hypotheses as to how individuals allocate energy, as populations genetically adapt to or phenotypically adjust to different environments. In coral reef fishes, the extent and underlying causes of such patterns across large geographic scales are poorly understood. Intraspecific phenotypic variation may be evident on a broad geographic scale, for example when comparing populations that are geographically isolated or those along a latitudinal cline. Such variation may be the consequence of local genetic variation due to natural selection, and/or it may reflect phenotypic and behavioural plasticity that is largely environmentally determined. Discriminating between these potential causes of local population differentiation is an important goal of evolutionary ecology. This study provides a comprehensive description of geographic life history variation (reproduction, growth, mortality) and performance (swimming ability) in a long-lived group of coral reef fishes (subfamily Amphiprioninae). It presents a unique evaluation of the degree to which life history and performance traits may be coupled, and determines whether these traits are environmentally induced vs. genetically determined by employing an integrated set of common-garden experiments. Chapter two of this thesis describes a comparative field study that examined latitudinal differences in the life history characteristics of three species of anemonefishes (Amphiprion melanopus, A. akindynos and Premnas biaculeatus) among three locations, including Kimbe Bay in West New Britain, Papua New Guinea (5&#186;30&#8217;S/150&#186;05&#8217;E), and Lizard Island (14&#186;40&#8217;S/145&#186;28&#8217;E) and One Tree Island (23&#186;30&#8217;S/152&#186;05&#8217;E) on the Great Barrier Reef, encompassing 18o of latitude. Life history theory predicts that populations from higher latitudes should exhibit larger adult body sizes, but smaller size at age (i.e. slower growth). Concomitant with slow growth, a delay in sexual maturation is expected, which should be compensated through the fecundity advantage of a larger size and longer lifespan. As predicted, maximum age increased with increasing latitude in all three species. A. melanopus always had a higher maximum age than either A. akindynos or P. biaculeatus at each location, reaching 38 years at the highest latitude location. At this location, A. melanopus also had a larger adult body size, slower growth, lower mortality, greater proportional age and size at maturity and sex change, larger egg size and higher batch fecundity than at either of the lower latitude locations, and thus conformed well to life history theory. For the other two species, maximum body size was smaller at the higher latitude location, there were no differences among locations in growth and mortality rates, and no consistent trends in the timing of maturation or sex change. Thus, while longevity varied with latitude as expected in all three species, some of the other life history traits examined did not. The divergence in magnitude and direction of life history patterns among these species suggests that there are processes beyond simple trade-offs that determine life history strategies. I discuss the hypothesis that in anemonefishes, selection for flexibility in life histories imposed by a highly specialised habitat and rigid social structure may oppose selection over latitudinal environmental gradients. Geographic variation in life history phenotypes between populations of a species is often assumed to reflect genetic divergence caused by natural selection. The relative contribution of genetic and environmental sources of phenotypic variation has never been determined in coral reef fishes. Yet, distinguishing between these sources of variation is fundamental to understanding the ecological and evolutionary significance of geographic life history variation. A conventional way of demonstrating the genetic basis of adaptive variation in the wild is to perform a common-garden experiment, in which individuals from different local populations are compared under identical environmental conditions established in a laboratory. This approach formed the basis of the following three chapters. In chapter three I determined whether the latitudinal variation in maternal reproductive traits observed in the wild has a genetic basis or whether it represents a phenotypic response to the environment. Adult fishes of the three species were collected from three latitudes along the Great Barrier Reef (Lizard Island, Britomart Reef at 18&#186;23&#8217;S/146&#186;63&#8217;E and One Tree Island) and their reproductive performance was monitored in a common-environment for up to 3 years. Based on life history theory and previous field observations I predicted larger egg sizes, but lower egg numbers in populations from higher latitudes. However, size-specific egg size, fecundity and reproductive output did not differ among populations in any of the three species held under identical environmental conditions. Thus, any divergence in these traits observed among natural populations most likely results from environmentally induced plasticity, rather than genetic divergence. The next chapter describes another common-garden experiment with a full-sib design to examine differences in early growth rates and growth plasticity and among the latitudinal populations described above. Temperature and food availability were manipulated under controlled laboratory conditions to determine whether there is intraspecific variation in growth plasticity in response to these two environmental factors. Given that environmental variability generally increases with latitude I expected that offspring from high-latitude populations should display greater levels of plasticity compared to their low-latitude counterparts. In all three species, mean growth rates differed significantly among populations and were consistent with the co-gradient variation hypothesis (i.e. offspring from low latitudes grew faster than offspring from high latitudes). Demonstrated under common-garden conditions, this implies that population-level variation in the growth capacity of juvenile anemonefishes has a genetic basis and should therefore respond to natural selection. Furthermore, significant genotype x environment interactions suggest the evolution of different growth reaction norms in response to temperature and food availability at different latitudes, although the variation did not always follow the predicted pattern. Overall, these results provide evidence for adaptive genetic differentiation for growth rate and growth plasticity in the early juvenile stages of these latitudinal populations. Swimming abilities of larval fishes are important to their survival, potentially affecting their ability to avoid predators, obtain food and control dispersal and recruitment patterns. To date, no attempt has been made to quantify geographic and population-level differences in swimming performance of coral reef fishes. The aim of chapter five was to determine if, and to what extent, there is heritable variation for swimming performance among populations of the three anemonefish species across a latitudinal gradient. Flume-based trials were conducted to measure maximum sustainable swimming speeds (or U-crit) as an estimate of aerobic capacity of laboratory-reared pre-settlement larvae. My results confirmed that these fishes have different intrinsic swimming capabilities, such that offspring from high-latitude populations out-performed those from lower latitudes in all three species. These consistent behavioural differences between populations in the laboratory may reflect adaptive specialisation in response to latitudinal changes in coral reef environments. Mean swimming speeds were inversely related to mean body sizes among populations, suggesting that observed patterns may arise from a trade-off with growth rate. This demonstrates that developmental attributes and performance are interrelated in a complex fashion, with multiple selection pressures acting on multiple aspects of the phenotype, and that adaptation involves trade-offs among competing functions. This study has shown that both phenotypic plasticity and genetic differentiation across environmental gradients may exist for important fitness-related traits in coral reef fishes. The high potential for gene flow and lack of obvious barriers to dispersal in these species does not appear to preclude local adaptation in life history and larval swimming capacity along a latitudinal gradient. These results are significant steps forward in resolving the evolutionary and ecological processes that explain the substantial variation in the life histories and behavioural abilities of coral reef fishes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1185/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1185/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reconciling the structural and metamorphic record of orogeny in central western New Hampshire through microstructure and garnet isopleth thermobarometry</field><field name="creator">Evans, Thomas Philip</field><field name="description">This thesis consists of four sections, each a stand-alone body of work intended for publication in international journals. The sections are ordered such that they progress in a logical fashion; the first two sections form an introduction to the new analytical techniques developed and utilised within this thesis, the remaining two sections present data and geological interpretations derived from the application of these techniques. Volume 1 contains the text and reference list, whilst Volume 2 contains the figures and appendices. Section A describes the technique of garnet isopleth thermobarometry, and outlines methods for analysing the relative contributions of the sources of error inherent to this technique. Additionally, some insights into the significance of common compositional variations within garnet are provided and discussed. Section B describes a method for calculating the changes in composition of the chemical system from which garnet is growing that are caused by crystal fractionation of garnet. This section has been published in The Journal of Metamorphic Geology (Evans, 2004), and is presented here unchanged. Section C utilises the methods described in the first two sections to determine a metamorphic history for the Garnet Hill and Salmon Hole Brook synclines of central western New Hampshire, USA. The thermal regime of the region during metamorphism was found to be characterised by localised, transient thermal heterogeneities. Two distinct episodes of metasomatism were also defined. Section D utilises the methods described in the first two sections to test a previously defined relative timing scheme for porphyroblast growth that was based on Foliation Intersection Axes preserved within porphyroblast (FIA). Additionally, a tectonic model for central western New Hampshire is presented that explains several key geological features of the region that contradict many of the existing tectonic models.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1188/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1188/2/02sectionA.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1188/3/03sectionB.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1188/4/04sectionC.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1188/5/05sectionD.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1188/6/06references.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1188/7/07appendices1-2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1188/8/08appendices3-7.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gardens of the mind: an exploration of the integral role of gardens in the lives of contemporary Australians by probing the construction of a public garden space and exploring visually an idiosyncratic artistic experience
 of the Flecker Botanic Gardens</field><field name="creator">Field, Laurine</field><field name="description">The research explores the construction of the garden in contemporary Australia through a visual
 art practice. The written thesis was conceived as a reflection upon the meaning of the Garden;
 and the exhibition as an individual interpretation of one particular public, tropical garden, that
 of the Flecker Botanic Garden. This Garden is located in suburban Cairns, Far North
 Queensland and is explored from the perspective of the aesthetic, sensory and spiritual, rather
 than the scientific.
 Our garden sanctuaries are the product of centuries of development in garden making
 and are symbols of people&#8217;s relationships with the environment. The garden is a significant part
 of Australian culture satisfying as it does a significant need in the contemporary Australian
 identity. This view is supported by an investigation into the highly interdisciplinary area of
 research of the nature of the garden in which attention is focussed on cultural geography to
 provide connections between place and identity. This is followed by an analysis into garden
 design and a discussion of the spiritual aspects of people&#8217;s interaction with the garden as a place
 of peace, reflection and renewal.
 The garden is an aspect of the landscape that is commonly associated with the domestic
 domain, rather than as a subject worthy of intellectual appraisal. In the realm of contemporary
 visual art this association has led to garden genre artworks traditionally holding an amateur
 status. In part, this is due to the lack of documentation about the ideology of the gardens in the
 garden genre in art. Gardens of the Mind seeks to address this deficit by examining artworks
 that have interpreted the garden in a manner that transcends the mundane and deals with aspects
 of people&#8217;s perception of their environment. Research into artistic insights of gardens found
 that depicting a sensory and spiritual connection between the plant and human worlds was
 frequently communicated through the use of intimate and multi-viewpoints. It was also
 expressed in artworks by including sensory information, conceptual titles, enlivening colour
 schemes and the depiction of growth forms in optimum health.
 My sensory response to the Garden was informed by the written research and by
 frequent field studies in which extensive photographic records were made in order to prompt
 recollection of the Garden&#8217;s colours and growth forms. I also interviewed the Curator of the
 Gardens and attended tours given by the Interpretative Officer in order to gain insight into the
 site of the FBG. The paintings and watercolour prints created were shown at the Cairns
 Regional Gallery from the 5th of February to the 6th of March 2005 in the exhibition entitled Gardens of the Mind. This was my first solo exhibition in a high status gallery and was a
 significant milestone. Exhibiting at the CRG extended my art practice, as I was able to explore
 exhibition concepts, utilise professional museum display techniques and present my work to a
 broad audience.
 The images in the exhibition Gardens of the Mind fall into two series &#8211; the Garden
 Series and the Wallpapers of the Mind Series. The Garden Series focuses on the lifeforce of
 flora and observation of plant forms. The more decorative works of the Wallpapers of the Mind
 Series are concerned with mark-making and are in part inspired by the history of flora in art.
 The artworks created represent the abundant visual delights and kinaesthetic experience of
 walking through the Gardens. This was done by including several downward views and closeup
 images of plant forms and by using the grid format to represent the diversity of plant forms.
 Manipulating colour schemes and depicting garden scenes filled with light communicated the
 uplifting experience of being in the Gardens. Gardens of the Mind represents the depiction of
 flora as a means of connecting with nature and thus operating from an intuitive side of
 perception.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1196/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1196/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flesh and the text: poststructural theory and writing research</field><field name="creator">Gannon, Susanne Marie</field><field name="description">This thesis is an analysis and practice of writing otherwise in academia. It takes off from Barthes&#8217; claim that &#8220;Science will become literature&#8221; (1989, p. 10) into a labyrinth of writing in different contexts and genres. In local and specific writing contexts, the author contrasts (social) scientific analytical writing with poetic, dramatic and autoethnographic writing to begin to generate theories about how different types of writing might work differently to construct different knowledges. Data from collective biography projects is re-presented as poetry and as a theatre script. Data from a professional development context becomes the launch pad for autoethnography. Sections of &#8220;creative&#8221; or &#8220;literary&#8221; writing are interspersed with theoretical and methodological analysis. The research methodologies of collective biography/ memorywork and autoethnography are interrogated in the light of poststructural theories on language. Poetry and drama are analysed as poststructural research and writing methodologies. The thesis is a risky journey into transgressive writing research. The linear narratives of research are disrupted as the thesis is organized as a series of detours into writing towards a conclusion that stresses the (im)possibilities of conclusions. Particular lines of flight through this thesis are the subject, the body and the other in writing. Poststructural perspectives on subjects emphasise their positionality (Foucault, 1972) and their mobility (Ferguson, 1993). Subjects are produced in particular spaces, places and times (Probyn, 2003) and this thesis attends to subjects-in-process in particular writing (con)texts. Writing is both the site and the practice of research. The body is pivotal in this thesis. All the texts produced in this thesis attend explicitly to the (female) body. The methodologies of collective biography/ memorywork (Davies et al., 2001; Haug, 1987), which provoked the poetic and dramatic writing in this thesis, begin with the body as the locus of knowledge. The particular research sites and texts of this thesis have given an overtly feminist cast to this textual body. My research colleagues have almost all been women and it is women&#8217;s embodied experiences that have been of interest to us. Research sites have ranged from Germany (where I was part of Project Area Body of the Internationale Frauenuniversit&#228;t in 2000), to a community theatre company in my town, to a writing group around my kitchen table. The &#8220;other&#8221; is the third line of flight in this thesis and I use the concept of the other to trace how the writing in this thesis has been a collaborative practice, and an ethical practice where writing the other (otherwise) might be seen as a practice of love (Cixous, 1991; Somerville, 1999).</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1201/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1201/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Child-initiated literacy episodes: sites of significant learning in early education

 Child-initiated literacy episodes occurred within scheduled literacy practices of the

 collaboration where literacies and learning embodied children&#8217;s lives. The interactive
 literacy episodes encompassed children&#8217;s sharing and volunteering information as
 they demonstrated understandings and literacies. The teacher-researcher
 acknowledged literacies as social practice and considered construction of learning, coconstruction
 of knowledge and interactive scaffolding as effective early childhood
 pedagogy. The open-ended scheduled literacy practices built on the children&#8217;s literate
 identities as they called on lived experiences, immediate and global worlds in
 everyday classroom life.
 The research conclusions illustrated children as dynamic and powerful learners as
 they initiated meaningful learning, made connections and demonstrated multiple ways
 of knowing in building their literate identities and using everyday literacies. In
 addition, the &#8216;enabling&#8217; teacher established classroom conditions that were underpinned by core assumptions and key understandings about how young children
 learned. Such classroom conditions enabled child-initiated literacy episodes to occur
 within the rich literacy context and become sites of significant learning.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1203/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1203/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kill, cure or strangle: The history of government intervention in three key agricultural industries on the Atherton Tablelands, 1895 &#8211; 2005</field><field name="creator">Gilmore, Marjorie Anne</field><field name="description">The Atherton Tablelands, west of Cairns in Far North Queensland, comprise some of the richest agricultural lands in Australia. The area was settled from the 1880s, following the discovery of gold and other minerals on the Palmer River, the Hodgkinson and the Herberton fields. Situated as it is on the economic and geographic periphery of Australia, government sponsored agriculture on the Tablelands was seen not so much as a food producing venture, as a means of closer settlement and strategic defence in accord with the White Australia Policy. Maize, dairy, and tobacco industries were set up by opening Crown Land for selection under conditions which inevitably caused destruction of thousands of acres of valuable rainforest, with consequent land degradation, erosion, and invasions of weeds. Subsequently, production became less than optimal, and without assured markets, transport systems and access to communications, the farmers struggled with subsistence conditions. In order to keep unviable industries alive, successive Queensland and Commonwealth governments intervened with a plethora of schemes which had the effect of subjecting farm families to years of poverty and despair. In the process, the industries became subject to ever-increasing regulation which stifled enterprise, and led to over-production of commodities for the available market. All of the industries were supported to some degree by mechanisms ranging from statutory marketing to subsidies, bounties, direct grants and tariff protection. When Australian governments moved to realign the economy of the nation according to neo-liberal principles, all of the support mechanisms which had allowed the industries to stay alive were withdrawn over a period of thirty years. The result has been predictable. Tobacco growing in the area has ceased, the dairy industry has declined to the point where it is unlikely to exist for much beyond 2010, and the maize industry is surviving as a provider of stock feed to the local market. This study traces the establishment, development, and rationalization of each industry, and records the effects of these processes on the people, the environment, the wider community, and the politics of the area. In terms of regional decline, it is a microcosm case study of the effects of government intervention, both in the process of regulation and deregulation. The lessons to be drawn from the study point to profound implications for the production of food within a sustainable environment in Australia.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1205/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1205/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constructing discourses: A postmodern interpretation of a rural public library system</field><field name="creator">Grant, Penelope Anne</field><field name="description">Aim.  Most of the literature related to the study of library and information science tends to spring from a modern, positivist paradigm. Only a small number of theorists, working in what some describe as &#8220;the periphery&#8221; of library and information science (Trosow 2001), explore the ways that postmodern thought can be applied to the study of libraries. This thesis looks at issues related to a particular public library through both modern and postmodern perspectives. The insights evoked raise questions about many of the basic tenets of public librarianship. Scope.  The subject of this study is the Vancouver Island Regional Library, a large integrated public library system on the west coast of Canada. The researcher is also the Executive Director. The underlying conceptual framework includes the idea that modern and postmodern thought are reflective of different epistemologies and play out differently within the contemporary social condition. The research is grounded in a qualitative, constructivist research tradition. Mailed questionnaires, individual interviews, and group interviews, using open-ended questions, are used to elicit opinions from board members, qualified librarians, local branch heads, and customers. Comments that seem to indicate a modern or postmodern perspective about such things as truth, knowledge, belief, the knowing subject, language, binary pairs, the role of the author, the organization of knowledge, the increase in information, professionals, power, the panoptic principle, moral panics, significant groups, feminism, culture, premodern phenomena, work, and bureaucracy, as they relate to the Vancouver Island  Regional Library, are interpreted hermeneutically. This interpretation, it is argued, evokes new and interesting insights into the Regional Library that would not be found through scientific analysis. A second cycle of hermeneutic interpretation evokes scepticism about many of the modern, positivist tenets of public librarianship that one participant suggests are &#8220;inculcated&#8221; into librarians. Questions are raised about such long-standing beliefs as the need for the librarian&#8217;s neutral stance; the necessity of the balanced collection; the public library&#8217;s role in supporting intellectual freedom; the intrinsic difference between fiction and non-fiction; the scientific nature of the Dewey Decimal Classification system; the superiority of professional librarians; the possibility of complete, correct reference transactions; the need to charge penalties to ensure materials are returned on time; the belief that the female nature of the workforce is not significant; the effectiveness of library bureaucracy; the need for increased tax support for public libraries; and traditional ways of planning for the future of public libraries. A number of pragmatic strategies are suggested. Conclusion.  The principal conclusion of the research is that postmodern thought can offer new insights into the Vancouver Island Regional Library. By implication it can help librarians and library and information science theorists understand other public libraries differently and, in so doing, assist public libraries adapt to the postmodern social condition.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1206/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1206/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The dialectic of control: A critical ethnography of renal nurses&#8217; decision-making</field><field name="creator">Hardcastle, Mary-Ann Rose</field><field name="description">Renal disease in Australia is increasing at an alarming rate. Many of the patients presenting with renal failure are from rural and remote areas where renal and other health care services are minimal. What services are available tend to be predominantly managed by nurses because of the way that renal services are organised in regional areas. Consequently, there is an assumption that renal nurses are autonomous in their practice and accountable for the decisions they make. The purpose of this study was to explore these assumptions within the bounds and context of a regional renal unit. The aim of the study was to increase nurses&#8217; awareness about their responsibility when taking on expanded nursing roles in terms of their decision-making ability, and capacity, and what this means in terms of accountability. Critical ethnography was adopted as the methodology to explore the nature of decision-making in the renal unit context. Particular emphasis was placed on how nurses used their knowledge during daily routine practice. Carspecken&#8217;s (1996) five-stage method of critical ethnography incorporated periods of prolonged participant-observation, structured and unstructured interviews and documentation review. Concepts from Giddens&#8217; (1984) structuration theory provided a theoretical framework that sensitised the researcher to certain &#8216;aspects of nursing practice&#8217; to guide data collection and analysis. These, in turn, provided major chapter headings for the thesis: decision-making across time-space encounters (Contextuality), the rules and resources (Social Structures) available for decision-makers and the nurses&#8217; ability and skills (Knowledgeability). In addition, Giddens (1984) &#8216;Dialectic of Control&#8217; was threaded throughout the finding chapters as a major theme that addressed the nurses&#8217; capacity (power and control) to make and implement decisions. Collectively the researcher and participants gained new insights about decision-making practices, during reflection and dialogue, one learning from the other. It was assumed that if, and when, decision-making concerns were recognised, the nurses themselves could possibly make changes to their practice with the aim of enhancing patient outcomes. Time-space played an important factor in controlling nurses&#8217; decision-making, but this was often in complex and subtle ways. Encounters across time-space often controlled who made decisions and when. This alternating decision-making behaviour caused conflict and confusion that, at times, undermined some nurses&#8217; authority and overall responsibility as decision makers. Even though many nurses spoke about being autonomous decision makers, most unknowingly followed established routines and practices that was not always conducive to best-practice principles. Social structures, the rules and resources, could enable and constrain decision-making within this context. The rules that nurses ascribed to were not always known at a discursive level, therefore, rationale could not always be given for the decisions they made. When rules could be spoken about, not all the nurses followed them. Reasons for breaching unit rules varied such as out-dated rules or policies, limited resources that required &#8216;short-cuts&#8217; and, at times, no recognition that rules were being broken. Knowing the rules and prescribing to routine practices provided a sense of safety as the nurses made decisions. This did not necessarily mean that best decisions were being made but gave a presentation that the decisions being made were satisfactory. Knowledgeability about the rules and resources available to nurses, and decision-making encounters across time-space, appeared to be a key feature that enabled the nurses to exercise their dialectic of control. When a nurse had, or perceived to have, control over the decisions they made, this, in turn, facilitated a sense of &#8220;being autonomous&#8221;. Despite this shared perception of being in control, several nurses remained frustrated and constrained by bureaucratic policies and hierarchical structures. However, the nurses, too, could create these constraints, knowingly or unknowingly, as they went about their day. Recommendations resulting from these findings include that further research is required on certain aspects of decision-making such as the role emotions play when making decisions, how ethical issues embedded in routine practice are recognised, and how risk and uncertainty are acknowledged and then managed. When nurses do not question their decision-making roles, they can become constrained in their decision-making capacity and ability. Without deliberate reflection aspects that control nurses&#8217; decision-making may never be exposed, thus changed. The implications of this study are central for both patient outcomes and the professional development of nursing.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1208/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1208/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phosphate stabilisation of partly oxidised, polyminerallic mine wastes</field><field name="creator">Harris, David Llewellyn</field><field name="description">The oxidation of sulphides present in mine waste may produce acidity and release dissolved metals and sulphate into local surface and ground waters. This process is known as acid mine drainage and is considered the most important environmental problem currently facing the mining industry. Phosphate induced stabilisation has been used to create passive iron phosphate coatings on pyrite and pyrrhotite. The formation of solid phosphate coatings on the sulphide grains thereby inhibits sulphide oxidation. The aims of this study were to determine whether the phosphate stabilisation technique would inhibit acid generation and attenuate metals released from partly oxidised, polyminerallic mine waste (obtained from the Montalbion Silver mine, north Queensland) under laboratory conditions. Sulphide-rich materials comprising the waste at the abandoned Montalbion silver mine have undergone extensive oxidation prior to and post mining. Weathering has led to the development of an abundant and varied secondary mineral assemblage throughout the waste material. Post-mining minerals are dominantly metal and/or alkali (hydrous) sulphates and generally occur as earthy encrustations or floury dustings on the surface of other mineral grains. The variable solubility of these efflorescences, combined with the irregular rainfall, controls the chemistry of seepage waters emanating from the waste dumps. Irregular rainfall events dissolve the soluble efflorescences which have built up during dry periods, resulting in &#8216;first flush&#8217; acid (pH 2.6&#8211;3.8) waters with elevated sulphate, Fe, Cu and Zn contents. Less soluble efflorescences, such as anglesite and plumbojarosite, retain Pb in the waste dump. Metal-rich (Al, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Zn) acid mine drainage waters enter the local creek system. Oxygenation and hydrolysis of Fe lead to the formation of Fe-rich precipitates (schwertmannite, goethite, amorphous Fe compounds) which, through adsorption and coprecipitation, preferentially incorporate As, Sb and In. Furthermore, during dry periods evaporative precipitation of hydrous alkali and metal sulphate efflorescences occurs on the perimeter of stagnant pools. Flushing of the streambed by neutral pH waters during heavy rainfall events dissolves the efflorescences resulting in remobilisation and transportation of sulphate and metals (particularly Cd, Zn) downstream. Thus, in areas of seasonal or irregular rainfall, secondary efflorescent minerals present in waste materials or drainage channels have an important influence on the chemistry of surface waters. Waste materials for the phosphate stabilisation experiments were sourced from the Montalbion silver mine. Three kinetic column leaching experiments were conducted using (a) polyminerallic unoxidised sulphidic mine waste and liquid phosphate stabiliser, (b) partly oxidised polyminerallic mine waste and liquid phosphate stabiliser, and (c) partly oxidised polyminerallic mine waste using liquid and solid phosphate fertilisers. SEM observations of the treated waste material showed that phosphate coatings and precipitates formed in all experiments. Metal-alkali phosphate coatings formed on all sulphides when KMnO4 and phosphate fertilisers were used in the coating solutions. Otherwise tetrahedrite was uncoated. The phosphate coatings were most abundant on chalcopyrite and were interpreted to be chemically connected with the underlying sulphide. In contrast, the metal, metal-alkali and alkali phosphate precipitates were interpreted to be physically connected to their substrates. The abundance of phosphate development appeared to be dependent on the abundance of cations in solution available for precipitation with the phosphate anions. The release of cations was predominantly dependent on oxidant strength, through sacrificial sulphide oxidation, or the dissolution of soluble sulphate minerals present in the partly oxidised waste. Leaching of the coated material in a strongly oxidising solution showed that the phosphate coatings and precipitates inhibited acid generation and probably inhibited metal release in all experiments. Thus, the phosphate coatings prevented oxidant access to the sulphide surfaces, inhibiting sulphide oxidation. Lead and Fe phosphates were the most stable in the oxidising solution, whereas Cu and Zn phosphates were partially dissolved. Arsenic and Sb were mobilised by the coating process due to the higher mobility of these metalloids at circum-neutral pH. The results of this study demonstrate that phosphate stabilisation can suppress sulphide oxidation and metal release in partly oxidised, polyminerallic mine wastes on a laboratory scale.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1229/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1229/2/02chapter1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1229/3/03chapter2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1229/4/04chapter3parts1to4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1229/5/05chapter3parts5to7.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1229/6/06chapter4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1229/7/07conclusions.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1229/8/08references.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1229/9/09appendixA.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1229/10/10appendicesB1toB3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1229/11/11appendicesB4toB5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1229/12/12appendicesB6toB9.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of the female reproductive tract on the motility and morphological characteristics of ram spermatozoa</field><field name="creator">Ismaya, .</field><field name="description">In mammals, millions of spermatozoa are deposited in the posterior female reproductive tract but only a few hundred reach the oviducts and from these only one will fertilise an oocyte in a mono-ovulatory species. Investigating why so few spermatozoa reach the oviduct and what was so special about these spermatozoa was the central theme to the studies reported in this thesis. The studies were conducted in the facilities of the Biomedical and Tropical Veterinary Science precinct, James Cook University and used Merino sheep as the model. In initial studies, semen was collected from rams by electroejaculation and it was demonstrated that not only did ram spermatozoa in undiluted semen have a limited life span but that were differences between rams. Some rams had spermatozoa that survived for less than six hours whereas in others, spermatozoa survived for 30 hours. These differences between rams were not present in semen diluted in Tyroide&#8217;s-albumin-lactate-pyruvate (TALP) medium. Nearly all spermatozoa in freshly ejaculated semen were uncapacitated but after 12 hours incubation in Hepessynthetic oviduct fluid (HSOF), 70% were capacitated. Baseline information on the detailed motility and movement characteristics was determined with a computer-aided semen analyzer (CASA). The results demonstrated that there is a heterogenous population of spermatozoa in a semen sample and that some rams had spermatozoa that had a significantly larger head area than others. This result was supported in later studies by manual measurements of the width and length of heads of spermatozoa. Semen was collected each month for 13 months from a group of six rams. A range of measurements of the semen was made including volume, colour and velocity and movement characteristics of spermatozoa as determined by CASA. These data were correlated with meteorological data. The quality of semen was significantly influenced by the mean daily maximum temperature and hours of bright sunshine with the months January to March being the times when ram semen was of poorest quality. Samples of spermatozoa were collected from a range of sites in the reproductive tract of naturally-mated ewes at 3, 6 and 24 hours after mating. The spermatozoa were examined for detailed velocity and movement characteristics, capacitation status and dimensions of spermatozoa. A surprising result was the low and variable percentage (range 2%-22%) of motile spermatozoa in the uterus particularly at 3 and 6 hours after mating declining to a mean of 2.7% 24 hours after mating. No difference in the velocity and movement characteristics of spermatozoa between the anterior and posterior reproductive tract could be identified. However, two important and interesting results were found. There was evidence that the ovary bearing the pre-ovulatory follicle or corpus haemorrhagicum influenced the distribution of spermatozoa as significantly more spermatozoa were found in the mid and anterior ipsilateral uterine horn and oviducts than the contralateral side 24 hours after mating. The same occurred 6 hours after mating except there was only a non significant trend for the uterine horns. The second important finding was that the spermatozoa in the oviducts had a significantly smaller head than elsewhere in the reproductive tract. Analysis of the capacitation status of spermatozoa demonstrated that spermatozoa can undergo capacitation and the acrosome reaction in all sites of the reproductive tract and by 24 hours after mating most spermatozoa were capacitated and acrosome-reacted.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1237/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1237/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transforming civics and citizenship education in the middle years of schooling : an exploration of critical issues informing teachers&#8217; theories of action</field><field name="creator">Jennings, Robert Neville</field><field name="description">In the past decade there has been a revival of interest in civics and citizenship education at the national and global level. While the revival of interest has influenced all levels of education, this study has a particular focus on civics and citizenship education in the middle years of schooling. It recognises that classroom teachers are &#8220;policy actors&#8221; who make individual meaning out of official policies on civics and citizenship education. On the other hand, it recognises that teachers are also autonomous agents who sometimes act independently of &#8220;official knowledge&#8221;. The aim of the study is to identify critical issues informing teachers&#8217; theories of action as they seek to engage young adolescents in meaningful learning experiences. The study is based on the assumption that young adolescents between the ages of 10 and 14 have specific needs and characteristics that present unique challenges for teachers of civics and citizenship education. The study uses a case study approach based on a selection of schools in Northern NSW and South Eastern Queensland. Participating teachers in an inner reference group conducted action research projects to investigate their theories of action in relation to civics and citizenship education. Data were also collected from an outer reference group of critical friends comprising teachers in other schools, teacher educators, consultants and trainee teachers sharing an interest in citizenship education. The study seeks to redress a perceived gap in the research literature about the knowledge, pedagogical skills and attitudes needed by teachers to make civics and citizenship education more meaningful for young adolescents. The study is founded on a conceptual framework of &#8220;critical theory&#8221; (Habermas, 1972; Fay, 1987; Carr and Kemmis, 1993). Critical theory provides a basis for understanding the critically reflective skills of teachers and also provides an epistemological base for the critical action research methodology used in the study (Kemmis and McTaggart, 2000). A series of semi-structured interviews with participating teachers over periods of one to three years provides a primary source of data on how teachers approach civics and citizenship education and the critical issues that inform their theories of action. Data are also collected by means of direct observation, keeping of professional journals and content analysis of policy and syllabus documents. Analysis of the data reveals three sets of critical issues: the first resulting from teachers&#8217; self reflection; the second identifying teachers&#8217; response to &#8220;official knowledge&#8221;; and the third identifying opportunities for transformative action. An analytical model is used to portray the relationships between critical issues that influence teachers&#8217; theories of action when they engage young adolescents in civics and citizenship education. The analysis identifies the critical issues that teachers of young adolescents face as they move from a concern to reproduce society towards a concern to transform society through civics and citizenship education programs. The study contains critical reflections on the research process and on the process of providing education for democracy. A practical outcome of the study is a set of guidelines for professional development programs seeking to develop a critical pedagogy of civics and citizenship education in the middle years of schooling.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1238/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1238/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computational and experimental modelling of the crushing of prepared sugar cane</field><field name="creator">Kannapiran, Arasu</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the investigation and application of porous media mechanics and elasto-plastic constitutive theory for the crushing of prepared sugar cane using finite element simulation. This research specifically investigates the experiments carried out on C. R. Murry Advanced Experimental Milling Facility using cane that has also passed through a series of basic tests to characterise its properties for the computational models. For isotropic plastic material behaviour, constitutive models that represent yielding under hydrostatic pressures are applied. The constitutive behaviour of the solid skeleton, and the plastic strain hardening response are derived from a series of slow speed confined uniaxial compression experiments. The liquid flow within fibrous solid matrix of prepared cane is modelled by applying Darcy's law, and the coefficient of permeability therefore was determined experimentally. The finite element technique applied to the crushing process, couple the elastoplastic constitutive theory for the solid fibre and the Darcy's liquid flow theory for the liquid juice in conjunction with the frictional relation between the roller and blanket material. The material law has been coded initially into a two-dimensional plane strain computer model. Series of experiments on two-roll mill was conducted. The two-dimensional plane strain model predicted the roll load in agreement with experimental values, however failed to capture the tangential component of compression and the torque values were 50% lower than the experimental values. However, numerical prediction of a flat roll surface matched well in roll load and torque with experimental values as the stress levels associated with grooves are absent. The rolls were then modelled with grooves in threedimension. The three-dimensional model captured high and low compression regions in groove tip and base respectively. The roll loads as well as roll torques matched well with experimental values.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1239/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1239/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantitative histopathology and epidemiology of prawn viral diseases</field><field name="creator">Littik, Semuel Ayub Mathias</field><field name="description">The interaction of prawns, viruses and the environment in disease development at individual and population levels was studied using histological and statistical analyses based on quantitative models and simple quantitative methods. At the individual level, quantitative histopathology was utilized to differentiate monodon baculovirus (MBV) in the digestive tissues (the midgut or MG and hepatopancreas or HP) of Australian Penaeus monodon and Penaeus merguiensis. It seems MBV in P. monodon was less damaging than in P. merguiensis. Indeed, P. monodon sustained significantly lower severity of MBV infection (mean&#177;SE of severity index (SI) = 1.6 &#177; 0.1) and proportion of abnormal cells (Rac = 34 &#177; 3%) with a significantly higher proportion of infected nuclei (Rin = 64 &#177; 3%); while P. merguiensis had significantly higher SI (2.1 &#177; 0.1) and Rac (76 &#177; 5%) with significantly lower Rin (46 &#177; 3%). Besides, the diameter of MBV occlusion bodies (OBs) in P. monodon (5.4 &#177; 0.3 &#956;m) was significantly larger than that in P. merguiensis (3.5 &#177; 0.4 &#956;m). Also, the number of MBV OBs per nuclei in P. monodon was moderately correlated to the OB diameter (R2 = 0.34, p &lt;&lt; 0.05), while in P. merguiensis it was weakly correlated (R2 = 0.12, p &lt;&lt; 0.05). Perhaps, P. monodon and MBV mutually determined the size of the OBs, whereas P. merguiensis mostly influenced the size of the OBs. Tissue tropism of Australia-type MBV in the AMG of P. merguiensis was reported for the first time based on MBV prevalence (91&#177; 6%), SI (2.4&#177; 0.1), Rcc (91&#177;3%) and significant dominance of the final stage of nuclear change. Overall, the HP of both penaeid species was more tolerant to MBV than the AMG since the HP contained significantly larger OBs and higher proportion of nuclei with the early stage of MBV infection compared to that in the AMG. For the first time a transect method was applied to analyse lymphoidal changes in P. monodon. This method was simple and cost effective since it detected the changes of the length of lymphoidal tubules and spheroids using a micrometer and a low-power light microscope. Two novel quantitative models were developed and tested here, i.e. the spheroid-total length ratio (STLR) and morphotype (MT) score. The results show that the ratio of spheroid length and morphotypes of the spheroids continually changed in a successive fashion from an early infection type (morphotype A) to a terminal type (morphotype C) in chronic or acute experimental infection by an insect Autographa californica nuclear polyhydrosis virus (AcNPV). Overall, this simple technique was sensitive and reliable to detect lymphoidal changes in the prawns. At the population level, risk factor analysis was applied relative to a declining prawn production in a farm with no written records of prawn diseases. Statistics were employed to investigate any possible correlation between the food budget (proxy measure of prawn health) and 10 parameters of daily water quality (265 working days from 18 crops); the biomass (proxy measure of prawn health) to 5 parameters of prawn biology, 6 parameters of farming management and 1 parameter of production (29 crops within 9 month data span); and 2 parameters of histology (35 sub-adult P. monodon). Coherence, analogy and histology show that high salinity (33 ppt), low temperature (26 oC), young age (&lt; 107 days), high stocking density (&gt; 20 individuals/m2), systemic bacterial infection (46% prevalence) and muscle necrosis (91% prevalence) were the potential risk factors of declining prawn production in the farm. Non-systemic and minor cellular changes associated with suspected viruses suggest that viral disease was very likely not a risk to the prawn production. Since molecular techniques can be used to confirm the diagnosis by histology, the histological diagnosis of MBV was compared to non-isotope in situ hybridization (NISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Molecular diagnosis of MBV appears to encounter technical difficulties, which were clarified in terms of possible causes and procedural modifications. Quantitative histopathology, statistical epidemiology and simple, low-costs, time-efficient and robust quantitative methods in this research may be suitable for places like Indonesia lacking sophisticated diagnostic facilities.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1245/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1245/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Handwritten signature verification using complementary statistical models</field><field name="creator">McCabe, Alan</field><field name="description">There is considerable interest in computerised personal identification and in particular in biometrics, a branch of identification that deals with verifying physical or behavioural characteristics of human beings. This thesis is concerned with the development of the particular biometric of handwritten signature verification which is superior in many ways to other biometric authentication techniques that may be reliable but are much more intrusive. Specifically this project involves the use of two complementary artificially intelligent systems in the form of neural networks and hidden Markov models. Five sample signatures are used to build a reference in each of the independent models and experimentation and testing is done using an extensive database of almost 4000 genuine signatures and forgeries. The confidence levels from each model are then combined and tested on unseen signatures resulting in an equal error rate of 1.1%. Further experimentation is performed and includes analysis of different verification scenarios, error contribution and the importance of visual feedback when signing. Finally, experiments are conducted exploring the possibility of "signing" handwritten passwords, with the developed system resulting in an equal error rate of 0.7% in the worst case.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1246/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1246/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The willow and the palm : an exploration of the role of cricket in Fiji</field><field name="creator">McGlusky, Narelle</field><field name="description">The starting point for this thesis is an investigation of the political role of cricket in the development of national identity among the colonies of the British Empire.

The game was used as a vehicle for entry into the closed society of the elite ruling class but was also utilized, both overtly and covertly, as a tool for resistance. This thesis examines this process in the Pacific state of Fiji through a study of the interaction of its political and social history with the development of cricket between 1874 and 1971. While the role of cricket in the development of national identity in the major test playing nations has been extensively explored, very little has been done to discover whether the processes in these countries operated in those ex-colonies where the game is still played but not to test standard. There also appears to have been little consideration given to the more pragmatic question of why the game prospered in some colonies rather than others. The role of sport in the colonial experience of the people of the Pacific islands has been neglected by historians. Utilising a broadly comparative approach, the study traces the Fijian experience with colonial sport through cricket. The importance of the sources of the game in other British colonies, the administration, missionaries and the education system, are placed in the Fijian context. The demographics of cricket in Fiji are established through a study of individual players. A contextual analysis of the game itself and the physical and geographical nature of Fiji reveal practical reasons for the game&#8217;s decline after its initial enthusiastic reception. The thesis establishes that although cricket initially flourished in Fiji, the nature of the game, Fiji&#8217;s climate and geography and the competition provided by rugby union and soccer, led to its decline. The weather and terrain frustrated the most enthusiastic attempts to promote the game. Rugby provided Fijians with a more compatible form of entertainment and excitement, dovetailing with current images of maleness and masculinity. Soccer gave Indo-Fijians a cheap leisure activity in which all could participate. Cricket remained a chiefly game and did not become popular with the general population. Relating the role of cricket to the concept of national identity within the Fijian state posed problems. National identity is intrinsically linked to nationalism and nationalism to the nation. Fiji does not fit comfortably within accepted definitions of the nation. During the period covered by the study, indigenous Fijians acknowledged cultural differences in their own society but retained a cohesive sense of ethnic identity which consolidated their polity. Nationalism, and national identity, presupposes an &#8216;other&#8217;. For Fijians the &#8216;other&#8217; was the immigrant Indian community, not the British. The need to prove themselves against the coloniser, which drove other British colonies, did not motivate the Fijians. They were not establishing a &#8216;new&#8217; national identity, only strengthening and re-working their existing identity to fit new circumstances. Hence their interaction with the game of cricket did not take on the political overtones experienced in other colonies.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1247/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1247/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the biology of the Indo-Pacific sandy shore crab, Matuta lunaris Forsk&#229;l (Brachyura: Calappidae)</field><field name="creator">Perez, Orpha Salatandre</field><field name="description">In this study, the relative growth, feeding, reproduction, absolute growth and population structure of the Indo-Pacific sandy shore crab, Matuta lunaris(Forskal)(Brachyura: Calappidae) were investigated, using samples collected in monthly intervals from Pallarenda beach, Townsville, Australia, between April, 1984 and May, 1985. The relative growth patterns of 15 morphological characters were determined using direct plots, log regressions and relative proportions. Three functional units were recognized, namely, the carapace, the chela and the abdomen and its associated structures. There were no marked changes in the relative growth patterns of the carapace dimensions with size, sex or sexual maturity. However, there were variations in the growth patterns of the chela characters and those of the abdomen and its associated structures, i.e. the thoracic plate and the pleopods. These variations appeared to be associated with the feeding and reproduction. Those of the chela were primarily related to size during ontogeny and were discussed in relation to changes in its mechanical capabilities. Those of the abdomen, the thoracic plate and the pleopods were related to sex and sexual maturity and were discussed in relation to the differences in the specific reproductive functions of these structures. Analysis of the stomach contents using the percent occurrence and percent point methods indicated that M. lunaris is a facultative scavenger and a predator of small crustaceans and molluscs. In addition, there were marked changes in the composition of its diet during ontogeny with small individuals primarily feeding on small crustaceans such as sergestids and copepods, and large individuals primarily feeding on hermit crabs, gastropods and bivalves. The reproductive biology was investigated using gonad indices, histological analysis of the gonads and field and laboratory observations of sexually mature individuals. Reproductive activity in terms of gamete production, mating behaviour and brood incubation was continuous throughout the year with marked asynchrony between individuals and no apparent seasonality. The mating behaviour involves a prolonged precopulatory grasping between a postpuberty male and a prepuberty female, after which the female undergoes a puberty moult and copulation occurs. Ovulation and oviposition were found to occur several weeks after copulation. Adult females were found to be capable of producing more than one egg batch from a single copulatory event with each batch containing approximately 65,000 eggs. The absolute growth pattern was determined based on the analysis of moult increment data. Both sexes were found to exhibit a determinate growth pattern with the puberty moult being the terminal moult. However, marked differences in the growth strategies of the two sexes were found. Male absolute growth is characterized by constant but relatively small (24.7%) moult increments and an unknown and possibly variable number of instars, each with a wide size range. Female absolute growth is characterized by relatively large (41-85%) but variable moult increments, and at least 5 distinct instars, each with restricted size ranges.  The population biology of M. lunaris in Pallarenda beach was assessed in terms of relative abundance, sex ratio, population structure and growth. M. lunaris was found to be abundant throughout the year, and although the population was dominated by large individuals (30-50 m carapace width) most size classes were consistently present. The sex ratio remained constant at 1:l. The estimated time between settlement and maturity was approximately 119 days in males and 148 days in females.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1248/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1248/2/02chapters1-4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1248/3/03chapters5-8.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1248/4/04appendices.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1248/5/05references.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Oral reading : the silent debate</field><field name="creator">Rennie, Jennifer Ann</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the relationship between the practice of reading out-loud and the teaching and learning of reading in the primary school. It argues that oral reading is a different practice from reading silently and that it contributes to the construction of a school reader in particular terms. Specifically it contributes to students' understanding of what it is to read and what it is to become a reader in school. The study adopts a sociocultural view of reading (Freebody &amp; Luke, 1990). Many past studies of oral reading used psychological approaches that ignored the historical, social, communicative and interactive contexts of oral reading practices. This thesis investigates oral reading from the perspectives of students, teachers and the researcher', using three different types of data gathering procedures: questionnaires, interviews and observations. It describes oral reading practices in terms of the pedagogies they maintain, the activities they build and the identities they construct. The study found that many oral reading activities were not an effective means for either the teaching or assessment of reading. Rather, oral reading activities were characterised by limited explicit instruction, which served to maintain the controlled nature of schooling. The rules, procedures and interactions preceding, surrounding and subsuming the various activities served to construct students' views of themselves as readers and what it means to read in school in restricted terms. The thesis has implications for reading pedagogy in that it presents a case for the reconsideration of these practices when teaching learner readers in schools.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1250/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1250/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A scientific basis for a comprehensive approach to managing sea turtle by-catch: the Queensland east coast as a case study</field><field name="creator">Robins, Julie Belinda</field><field name="description">The Australian continental shelf is one of the few remaining areas of the world where sea turtle populations have been subject to relatively small levels of direct harvest and where nesting- and feeding-ground habitats remain essentially intact. The area supports six of the world&#8217;s seven sea turtle species (i.e., Chelonia mydas, Caretta caretta, Eretmochelys imbricata, Natator depressus, Lepidochelys olivacea and Dermochelys coriacea), contains significant nesting populations of three species (i.e., Chelonia mydas, Caretta caretta, Eretmochelys imbricata), the world&#8217;s only nesting populations of N. depressus and is the main feeding-grounds area of Natator depressus. The incidental capture of sea turtles in the trawl fisheries of northern Australia was a significant threat to sea turtle populations of Australia. Trawl by-catch mortality of Caretta caretta is considered to have contributed to the 80% decline in numbers of nesting sea turtles in eastern Australia, but this speculation is based on limited or unpublished data relating to mortality associated with trawl fisheries. There is limited information on the potential impact of trawl fisheries on other sea turtle species that occur in Australian waters. Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) were legislated for use in trawl fisheries of northern Australia in 1999. TEDs allow sea turtles to escape from trawl nets whilst enabling the trawl fishery to continue to operate and catch prawns. TEDs can be an effective solution to sea turtle by-catch, but the adoption and use of TEDs in a fishery needs to be monitored to ensure that the devices are having the desired outcome i.e., sea turtle exclusion. The scale and geographic extent of Australian trawl fisheries have the potential to result in a poor capacity to monitor the effective use of TEDs by fishers. TED compliance strategies (i.e., monitoring and enforcement) should be focused in areas where the effective use of TEDs would have the greatest benefit to sea turtle conservation i.e., areas where sea turtle by-catch or mortality is greatest. The present study adopted a comprehensive approach to understanding the interaction between trawling and endangered sea turtle species in waters adjacent to the Queensland east coast, by collecting and utilising baseline data on the size and distribution of sea turtle by-catch. Aspects of compliance strategies for TEDs that would contribute to the sustainable management of sea turtle by-catch in trawl fisheries are also considered. In this context, the following objectives are addressed in this thesis: (i) To estimate the number and species composition of sea turtles caught and killed in a multiple sector trawl fishery using spatial stratification; (ii) To examine the behavioural responses of sea turtles to trawl capture in order to investigate the potential for post-trawl mortality; (iii) To investigate the factors that influence the distribution pattern of sea turtles, and from this analysis, predict the relative in-water densities of sea turtles at broad spatial scales; and (iv) To develop a spatially explicit strategy for TED compliance (i.e., monitoring and enforcement), based on an assessment of the interaction between sea turtles and fishing effort. The thesis concentrates on sea turtle by-catch in the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery, but has broader implications for the management of sea turtles in their feeding-grounds. Baseline information on sea turtle by-catch was collected from select commercial fishers who voluntarily reported information on sea turtles caught in the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery. About 1,500 sea turtles were reported caught during ~24,000 days of trawling by 105 fishers who participated in a voluntary program to monitor sea turtle by-catch between 1991 and 1996. Stratified, weighted analysis of the data resulted in an annual estimated sea turtle catch of about 5,900 for the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery, given a mean annual total fleet effort of about 85,000 days fished per year. The catch was comprised of Caretta caretta (~50%), Chelonia mydas (27%), Natator depressus (16%) and Lepidochelys olivacea (6)%. The fishery had minimal catches of Eretmochelys imbricata and Dermochelys coriacea. Sea turtle by-catch was dominated by immature individuals, with between 60 and 80% of individuals caught being immature, based on approximate size-at-maturity for each species. Estimates of total mortality were based on observed rates as well as published mortality rates from USA shrimp trawl fisheries. In general, mortality rates of sea turtles caught in the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery were lower than mortality rates reported for other trawl fisheries in northern Australia and the USA. Lower mortality rates were probably a function of the tow duration associated with various sectors of the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery. However, the combined by-catch of sea turtles in the three major trawl fisheries of northern Australia (i.e., the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery, the Northern Prawn Fishery and Torres Strait Prawn Fishery) was estimated to be of sufficient magnitude to have contributed to the observed declines in nesting numbers of east Australian Caretta caretta. Estimates of the mortality of sea turtles in the trawl fisheries of northern Australia raise concerns about the likely impacts of these fisheries on other species of sea turtle, particularly Australian sub-populations of Natator depressus and Lepidochelys olivacea. These species frequent feeding-ground habitats typical of trawl grounds and are poorly monitored through nesting-ground surveys. The scale of impact estimated in this thesis indicates that the use of TEDs in the trawl fisheries of northern Australia is warranted. Mortality rates of trawl-caught sea turtles could be higher than currently estimated if sea turtles die after release as a consequence of the delayed effects of capture or secondary mortality resulting from changes in diving behaviour. Six trawl-caught sea turtles were monitored post-release using ultrasonic transmitters and Temperature Depth Recorders in order to assess their diving patterns for signs of modified behaviour. Two rodeo-caught sea turtles were monitored post-release as controls to the trawl-caught individuals. All sea turtles swam rapidly away from the point of release and displayed a period of frequent surfacing behaviour that was speculated to represent swimming and hyperventilation. The sea turtles then settled into a steady pattern where dive intervals were long and regular. This was speculated to represent recovery behaviour. &#8216;Normal&#8217; activity patterns, as documented in the literature, were not apparent in the dive profiles of the trawl-caught sea turtles within the post-release monitoring period (i.e., 66 hours). Rodeo-caught sea turtles displayed &#8216;normal&#8217; activity patterns at about 85 and 111 hours post-release. There was no evidence of delayed post-release mortality in the limited number of individuals monitored. However, the trawl-caught sea turtles displayed modified diving patterns that potentially made them more susceptible to secondary mortality such as boat strike or predation. Recovering sea turtles did not appear to undertake normal feeding activities, suggesting that sea turtles exposed to non-lethal interactions with human activities on a frequent basis may have lower growth rates. The results suggest that sea turtles are affected by interactions with humans to a much greater extent than previously thought and that the recovery period of such interactions can take several days The relative spatial distribution of sea turtles is poorly known and is insufficient for developing management plans, such as monitoring and enforcement strategies for TEDs. Sea turtle catch per unit effort from trawl captures and sea turtle sightings from aerial surveys were used to estimate the relative density of sea turtles in the waters adjacent to the Queensland east coast. As expected, sea turtles were not evenly distributed, with several areas having exceptionally high relative densities. In trawled areas, the relative density of sea turtles was significantly correlated with the benthic species trawled (e.g., species of prawn) as well as water-depth. Natator depressus and Lepidochelys olivacea had high relative densities in inshore, tropical waters less than 40 m deep, where tiger prawns (Penaeus esculentus, P. semisulcatus) and endeavour prawns (Metapenaeus endeavouri, M. ensis) were caught most commonly. Caretta caretta had high relative densities in inshore, sub-tropical waters less than 30 m deep, where banana prawns (Fenneropenaeus merguiensis) or bay prawns (Metapenaeus bennettae i.e., Moreton Bay) were caught most commonly. The relative density of sea turtles was predicted for the majority of waters adjacent to the Queensland east coast based on the mean sea turtle CPUE and information on target species caught most commonly and mean-depth trawled. The relative distribution of sea turtle density developed in this thesis provides the first broad scale maps that quantitatively identify areas that appear to be important as sea turtle habitat. This information could be used to assist the conservation management of sea turtles populations of eastern Australia. Sea turtle by-catch in northern Australia has been addressed through the mandatory use of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) in otter trawl fisheries. However, the use of TEDs in a fishery needs to be supported by monitoring or enforcement to ensure that TEDs are used effectively, but this is difficult in fishery that operates over a large geographic scale. A pragmatic solution would be to target the monitoring and enforcement of TEDs in critical areas where reductions in sea turtle by-catch will make the greatest contribution to recovery of impacted populations of sea turtles. The spatial distribution of effort for the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery in the year 2001 was integrated with the relative density of sea turtles to identify critical areas for sea turtle by-catch. Critical areas for sea turtle by-catch were similar despite the use of qualitative or quantitative methods. The results suggest that effective TED use is most critical in the inshore waters of the Queensland east coast. Monitoring and enforcing TEDs in these critical areas would enable fisheries managers to measure progress towards the stated target of the 95% reduction in sea turtle by-catch and contribute to the sustainable management of the fishery. The use of TEDs in non-critical areas should also be monitored, but because of the lower contribution of these areas to sea turtle by-catch, monitoring and enforcement could take place with less intensity. Critical areas for monitoring the effective use of TEDs may change if the intensity of fishing effort changes and may become unnecessary should it be demonstrated that most fishers comply fully with TED regulations.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1251/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1251/2/02chapters1-3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1251/3/03chapter4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1251/4/04chapter5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1251/5/05chapter6-7.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1251/6/06references.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1251/7/07appendices.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology of crustose coralline algae; interactions with
 scleractinian corals and responses to environmental conditions</field><field name="creator">Harrington, Lindsay Mortan</field><field name="description">Crustose coralline algae (CCA) are considered a key functional group in coral reef
 ecosystems. Changes in the abundances of certain CCA species can directly regulate
 the abundance of other components of reefs, in particular corals, and can therefore
 result in changes in structure and function of this marine ecosystem. This thesis
 assesses important questions on what controls distribution and abundance patterns of
 tropical CCA species along environmental gradients, their responses to sedimentation
 and the herbicide diuron, and species-specific differences in their roles in inducing or
 inhibiting coral recruitment, hence contributing to the structuring of coral reefs.
 The taxonomic composition of CCA is described for the inshore and offshore reefs
 within the central and northern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Twenty-three species from
 twelve genera and three subfamilies of Corallinaceae were identified to species level
 using reproductive and vegetative morphology and anatomical features as diagnostic
 characters. Distribution and relative abundance of the species were compared along
 gradients in depth and across the shelf, and along a set of environmental variables
 such as slope angle and sedimentation. Changes across the continental shelf were
 observed in CCA cover and CCA community composition, as well as in the
 environmental variables slope angle, sediment deposits, and water clarity. Percent
 cover of CCA increased more than four-fold across the shelf. Inshore reefs were
 dominated by thin leafy non-adherent corallines (i.e. Mastophora pacifica), whereas
 offshore reefs were dominated by thick adherent species (i.e. Porolithon onkodes and
 Neogoniolithon fosliei). Abundances of several species were significantly related to
 cross-shelf distance, depth and sedimentation. For example, the most abundant CCA,
 Porolithon onkodes was 4 times more abundant on offshore reefs compared to inshore
 reefs, and preferred shallow depths (2 to 5 m) and low sediment deposits. Conversely,
 the most abundant species on the inshore reefs, Hydrolithon reinboldii, decreased in
 abundance across the shelf, preferred deeper depths (8 to 12 m) and was not affected
 by high levels of sediment. Differences in CCA communities between inshore and
 offshore reefs may however be additionally related to the factors of wave force,
 grazing and water clarity. On the inshore reefs, the reduced cover of CCA, the dominance of thin and leafy species and the reduced abundance of thick consolidators
 have profound implications for differences in the ecosystem structure.
 At present, the degree to which human activity can affect abundance and species
 composition of CCA on reefs is poorly understood. The herbicide diuron
 (N&#8217;-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-N, N-dimethylurea) is detectible in many inshore sediment
 samples along the central Queensland coast. Organisms living on some of the inshore
 coral reefs of the GBR are regularly exposed to river plumes transporting this
 herbicide. This study compares physiological responses and survival of CCA that
 were exposed to diuron and to sedimentation, separately and in combination, in
 controlled time course laboratory experiments, using pulse-amplitude modulation
 chlorophyll fluorometry. The results demonstrate that sediment deposition and
 exposure to diuron when applied in isolation can negatively affect the photosynthetic
 activity of CCA, but were often reversible depending on diuron concentration and
 sediment type. Significant reductions in effective quantum yields (DF/Fm&#8217;) of
 photosystem II in CCA species were observed at nominal diuron concentrations
 greater than 1 mg L-1. Exposure to fine (&lt;63 mm grain size) nutrient-rich estuarine
 sediments reduced DF/Fm&#8217; more than exposure to the same amount of fine (&lt;63 mm
 grain size) calcareous sediments. There are clear differences in sedimentation
 tolerance between species, with an inshore species (H. reinboldii) being more
 sediment tolerant than two offshore species (P. onkodes and N. fosliei).
 Sedimentation stress is however significantly enhanced by trace concentrations of
 diuron, and recovery from a combined sediment and diuron exposure was still
 incomplete after 9 days. The finding of synergistic effects of simultaneous exposure
 to sedimentation and diuron on CCA has implications for the recruitment of the vast
 number of reef organisms specialized to settle on CCA.
 The ability of coral larvae to identify an appropriate site for settlement and
 metamorphosis is critical for recruitment. Crustose coralline algae are known to
 induce metamorphosis of coral larvae in the laboratory. The aim of this field study
 was to determine what types of substrata (namely reef-dwelling species of CCA) coral
 recruits settle on and at what orientation (i.e. upper, lower or vertical surfaces). This
 study was conducted in 3 regions: in the GBR on inshore and offshore reefs, and in the Caribbean. After one year, the amount of unoccupied substrata (bare), and the
 space occupancy of CCA, Peyssonnelia sp., invertebrates and turf algae on the
 settlement tiles varied between the 3 regions. On offshore reefs in the GBR the
 percent of CCA on the tiles was greatest (26%) and turf algae lowest (5%). On
 average, 89% of coral recruits were found on the bottoms and sides of the settlement
 tiles. Most coral recruits in the GBR and in the Caribbean attached to a widespread
 but rare CCA, Titanoderma prototypum, that overall comprised less the 5% of the
 coralline flora on natural reef surfaces, but as a pioneer species, nevertheless covered
 2.5% of the settlement tiles. Most other reef-dwelling organisms, such as other
 encrusting algae (i.e. the CCA species H. reinboldii and Porolithon sp. and the
 non-coralline crust Peyssonnelia sp., which induce metamorphosis under laboratory
 conditions), and some invertebrates (specifically polychaetes, foraminifera and
 attached bivalves), supported significantly lower coral recruit densities. In all regions
 combined, only 0.1% of the coral recruits settled onto turf algae despite it covering
 14% of the tiles, and 0% settled on sediment-covered surfaces, macroalgae and certain
 species of dominant CCA. Titanoderma prototypum may provide a good attachment
 surface in microhabitats where competition and grazing from other reef organisms is
 low. This research identifies the available settlement substrata for coral settlement in
 the GBR and Caribbean and highlights the critical role a single species can play in the
 structure and function of a highly complex ecosystem.
 Several species of CCA are known to induce coral settlement, however CCA also
 employ physical and biological anti-settlement defence strategies at varying
 effectiveness. This study describes the chemical and physical recognition and ranking
 of five CCA species and inert settlement substrata by coral larvae, and the subsequent
 survival of these larvae on the varying substrata. Settlement on the most preferred
 substratum, T. prototypum, was 15 times higher than on the least preferred
 substratum, N. fosliei. The rates of post-settlement survival of the corals also varied
 among CCA species in response to their anti-settlement strategies (shedding of
 surface cell layers, overgrowth and potential chemical deterrents). Rates of larval
 settlement, post-settlement survival and the sensitivity of larvae to chemical extracts
 of CCA were all positively correlated across the five species of CCA. Non-living
 settlement substrata on coral reefs are sparse, consequently the presence of only a few CCA species that facilitate coral recruitment has important implications for
 structuring the reef ecosystem.
 These four studies have extended our knowledge of basic ecology of CCA and their
 important role in structuring coral reefs. They have also advanced our knowledge of how the
 mosaic of benthic organisms, influenced by human disturbances, affect coral settlement. A
 small and inconspicuous species of CCA that strongly facilitates and catalyzes coral
 recruitment on reefs has been identified. The information gained from these studies assists in
 the understanding of reef recovery, and therefore may contribute to the management and
 conservation of reef ecosystems.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1264/1/01front.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The settlement experience of Asian immigrant and humanitarian entrant people living in the Australian regional centre of Coffs Harbour, New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Van der Veen,  Roger Neal</field><field name="description">Australia has accepted several million immigrant and humanitarian entrant people since the large-scale immigration program began at the end of World War II. Since the White Australia Policy was completely abandoned in the early 1970s, many more Asian immigrant and humanitarian entrant people have arrived in Australia. They have disproportionately moved to and settled in the metropolitan centres, and not the regional centres. There is very little literature about the settlement of Asian immigrant and humanitarian entrant people in Australian regional centres. This research used a dialectic social work lens to analyse critically how settlement was structurally and individually framed by exploring the settlement experience of Asian immigrant and humanitarian entrant people living in an Australian regional centre, using Coffs Harbour NSW as a case study. Respondents (31) and key informants (16) were interviewed using in-depth, semi-structured, face-to-face interviews. There were six themes that proved to be significant that exhibited minimal social inclusion of Asian immigrant and humanitarian entrant people, resulting in a position of social inequality: Firstly, compatriots were present in small numbers, but were not deemed important. They did not play much of a role in the settlement of the respondents. Secondly, DIMIA funded hours of English language tuition were quite limited, and this resulted in most respondents only learning survival to functional English. Thirdly, the respondents had to interact with the townspeople, because of a lack of compatriots. Through this interaction, the respondents were forced to speak and learn more English. They were seen to be reaching out, by the townspeople. Fourthly, the respondents reported experiencing mainly low-level and unintentional discrimination and racism. The townspeople were reported overall as polite but tentative (tolerant but not accepting). Fifthly, the respondents were employed in part-time and casual work ranging from unskilled to semi-skilled. Their level of English kept them out of the occupations they wanted to work in, and this was not likely to change in Coffs Harbour; although, most of the respondents were employed in some capacity. Sixthly, belongingness, acceptance by the dominant group and the respondents&#8217; sense of place, was attributed to Australia and in some cases to Australia and the country of origin. Belongingness was not attributed to Coffs Harbour or to compatriots. This reflects Australia, as the preferred country in which to live because of its standard of life. The respondents&#8217; settlement was found to be one of minimal social inclusion (tolerance) resulting in a position of social inequality. This research has advocated change and reform, by striving to individualise the structural and giving voice to a marginalised group of people and then using this collectivised voice to advocate for change on the structural level. The commencement of this change and reform is the reconceptualisation of regional settlement.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1279/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1279/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Extensions to the COSRAD HF ocean surface radar : extraction of swell wave parameters</field><field name="creator">Bathgate, Jonathan Stacy</field><field name="description">Routine extraction of ocean surface information from HF radar spectra has, to this point, been predominantly limited to surface currents and wind parameters which rely on the analysis of the first-order spectral lines. Recently, wind wave parameters are also being supplied in a routine manner. Their calculation involves the ratio of first and second-order spectral energies to produce significant wave heights and direction. Parameter extraction from portions of the long ocean wave spectrum has proven difficult. The derivation of the second-order cross-section by Barrick (1972b) led to solutions for the extraction of swell wave information (Lipa and Barrick, 1980). However, this still did not lead to a reliable supply of long wave information. Only recently has there been some success with full directional spectrum analysis under certain conditions, (Wyatt, 1999). The solutions provided by Lipa and Barrick (1980) are evaluated in this thesis on data collected by the coastal ocean surface radar (COSRAD). The results proved unsatisfactory due to the high sensitivity required by the solutions. To develop an original method of extraction for swell wave information, two sets of data were acquired using a pair of COSRAD systems overlooking Tweed Heads and Bass Strait in 2001. At Bass Strait the radar was configured to cover a sweep (approximately 60 degrees) every 60 minutes with spatial resolution of the order of 3km. Spectral preprocessing procedures included frequency and power level normalization prior to incoherent averaging. We average 8 adjacent pixels over a 2-hour period to improve the signal to noise ratio and aid in the identification and manipulation of the second-order swell peaks that lie about the strong first-order Bragg lines in the spectrum. A new method for the extraction of swell wave parameters from HF radar spectra is presented along with results and comparisons to a directional wave buoy which lies in the coverage zone. The method of extraction of the parameters, period, direction and height, relies on a frequency modulation approach that describes the hydrodynamic interaction of the swell waves with the resonant, shorter, Bragg waves. The analysis process minimises the electromagnetic second-order interaction and a simulation model was used to validate the approach. This simplified method provides a fast means of examining swell conditions over large areas of the ocean surface. The automated algorithm returned results that compared favourably with the wave buoy at both deployment locations. The best results were achieved during periods of swell activity that exceeded 0.3 m in height, below this value the second-order sidebands became noisy and unreliable. During these periods the swell height was measured to within &#177;0.1 m of the wave buoy. The swell direction was measured to accuracies of &#177;10 degrees and the swell period to &#177;1 second. The results support the use of the COSRAD HF ocean surface radar for mapping swell in the nearshore zone and shows potential for the routine extraction of parameters in near real-time. A routine for the extraction of wind direction was also developed and tested on data collected during the deployment at Tweed Heads. A comparison of pairs methodology for the resolution of the inherent ambiguity in wind direction about the radar beam is presented. The determination of an appropriate spreading parameter is demonstrated, as carried out previously by Heron and Prytz (2002), to refine the directional results in comparison with wind wave data from the wave buoy.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1287/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1287/2/02chapters1-2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1287/4/03chapters3-8.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1287/5/04references.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stereochemical effects on intervalence charge transfer</field><field name="creator">D'Alessandro, Deanna M.</field><field name="description">This thesis reports the first observation of stereochemical effects on intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) in di- and trinuclear mixed-valence complexes. The differential IVCT characteristics of the diastereoisomers of polypyridyl complexes of ruthenium and osmium offer a new and intimate probe of the fundamental factors that govern the extent of electronic delocalisation and the barrier to electron transfer. These findings challenge prior assertions that the inherent stereochemical identity of such complexes would have no influence on the intramolecular electron transfer properties of polymetallic assemblies. Chapter 1 addresses these issues within the context of the existing theoretical and experimental framework for IVCT. Solvatochromism studies on the meso and rac diastereoisomers of [{Ru(bpy)2}2(&#956;-bpm)]5+ {bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine; bpm = 2,2'-bipyrimidine} reported in Chapter 2, reveal striking differences between their IVCT characteristics due to stereochemically-directed specific solvent interactions. Such effects are inconsistent with dielectric continuum theories of solvation which are typically used to assess the contribution of the Franck-Condon outer-sphere reorganisational energy to the electron transfer barrier. Solvent proportion experiments demonstrate that the magnitude of the specific interaction is enhanced for the rac relative to the meso form, as the dimensionality of the &#8220;clefts&#8221; between the planes of the terminal polypyridyl ligands are ideally disposed to accommodate discrete solvent molecules. Subtle and systematic variations in the size and shape of the clefts through bridging ligand modification and the judicious positioning of alkyl substituents on the terminal ligands reveal that the magnitudes of the effects are dependent on the different cavity dimensions, and the number, size, orientation and location of solvent dipoles within the clefts. Chapter 3 discusses stereochemically-directed solvent and anion interactions in systems of the type [{M(bpy)2}2(&#956;-BL)]5+ {M = Ru, Os} where BL denotes an extensive series of N-heterocyclic di- and tri-bidentate polypyridyl bridging ligands. NIR region electroabsorption (Stark effect) measurements of the mixed-valence complexes reveal small dipole moment changes for the IVCT transitions. In all cases, the effective charge transfer distances are negligible compared with the geometrical metal-metal separations, in support of a moderately- to strongly-delocalised assignment for the systems. This contrasts previous assertions in the literature which favoured a localised (&#8220;Class II&#8221;) classification for complexes of the genre. IVCT solvatochromism and thermochromism studies on the mixed-valence species reveal that a subtle increase in the extent of inter-metal coupling with bridging ligand modification reduces the reorganisational barrier to electron transfer and leads to a transition between the localised (&#8220;Class II&#8221;) and localised-to-delocalised (&#8220;Class II-III&#8221;) regimes. The importance of the bridging ligand in mediating the IVCT process necessitates a three-state theoretical analysis for the IVCT line-shape which explicitly includes the symmetric vibration mode. The comproportionation constants (Kc) which are typically used to assess the degree of metalmetal coupling are markedly dependent on the electrolyte anion and the stereochemical identity of the complex. This emphasises the need for standard conditions for data from which analyses based on the magnitude of Kc are made, and the danger of over-interpretation of the values. The differential anion interactions between the diastereoisomers are also manifested in their IVCT characteristics and represent a redox asymmetry contribution to the electron transfer barrier. The magnitude of the differences between the IVCT characteristics of the diastereoisomeric forms of the same complex are more pronounced in the presence of inherent structural distortions in the bridging ligands, which are evident in their solid-state X-ray crystal structures. Such distortions decrease the extent of delocalisation through their redox asymmetry contribution to the electron transfer barrier. The interconfigurational (IC) transitions in the fully-oxidised forms of the dinuclear osmium complexes indicate that stereochemical effects modulate the energy levels of the metal-based d&#960; orbitals themselves, which are split by spin-orbit coupling and ligand field asymmetry. Chapter 4 extends the IVCT probe to stereochemically-pure trinuclear assemblies through a systematic investigation of the influence of the oxidation state, nuclearity and overall geometry of the systems on their intramolecular electron transfer processes. The IVCT properties of the dinuclear complexes [{Ru(bpy)2}(&#956;-HAT){M(bpy)2}]5+ {M = Ru, Os} and [{Ru(bpy)2}2(&#956;-ppz)]5+ are contrasted with their trinuclear analogues, which are &#8220;cluster-type&#8221; [{Ru(bpy)2}2{M(bpy2)}(&#956;-HAT)]n+ or &#8220;chainlike&#8221; [{Ru(bpy)2}2{Ru(bpy)(&#956;-ppz)2}]n+ {n = 7, 8; M = Ru, Os; BL = HAT (1,4,5,8,9,12- hexaazatriphenylene) and ppz (4,7-phenanthrolino-5,6:5',6'-pyrazine)}. While the diastereoisomers of the dinuclear complexes possess similar electrochemical and IVCT characteristics, the trinuclear &#8220;clustertype&#8221; system bridged by HAT exhibits significantly greater electronic coupling than the &#8220;chain-like&#8221; assembly based on ppz. The IVCT transitions in the singly-oxidised (+7) and doubly-oxidised (+8) trinuclear mixed-valence species are markedly different to those in their dinuclear analogues due to appreciable second-order interactions which depend on the overall geometry and oxidation state of the assemblies. The observation of stereochemical effects on IVCT illustrates the subtle interplay of factors that govern the localised-to-delocalised transition, and addresses the limited experimental data which exist to probe the microscopic factors that facilitate this transition. The recognition of such effects on intramolecular electron transfer processes has significant implications for the elucidation of spatial influences on electron migration in biological systems such as metalloenzymes in nature. Ultimately, stereochemical modifications may be exploited in materials science applications to &#8220;fine-tune&#8221; the physical properties of novel molecular devices such as artificial photosynthetic systems for solar energy harvesting.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1289/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1289/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of socioeconomic factors in customary coral reef management in Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Cinner, Joshua Eli</field><field name="description">For generations, communities in the Pacific islands have employed a range of resource management techniques (including reef closures, gear restrictions, limiting entry, and the protection of spawning aggregations) to limit marine resource use. Because of their perceived potential to meet both conservation and community goals, these traditional resource management techniques are being revitalized by communities, governments, and conservation groups as an integral part of national and regional marine conservation plans in the Pacific. However, it is uncertain whether traditional management can provide a solid foundation for the development of these conservation strategies. Little is known about the social, economic, and cultural processes that enable communities to employ traditional management and it remains unclear if the traditional management systems will be resilient to the profound socioeconomic changes sweeping the Pacific region. Indiscriminate application of &#8220;traditional&#8221; solutions to present day problems in Pacific communities without understanding the socioeconomic context in which these systems can operate effectively may lead to disappointment with results and disenchantment with the conservation process if results do not meet expectations. Theoretical and empirical studies have identified a number of specific socioeconomic factors that may influence the ability of a community to implement or maintain traditional management, but specific relationships between socioeconomic conditions and the use of traditional management practices are still not well understood. This thesis aims to examine the socioeconomic context within which select traditional management systems operate in Papua New Guinea and further debate on how these systems may be applicable in the modern conservation context by exploring the following research questions: Do communities with traditional reef closures have different socioeconomic characteristics than communities that do not? How do traditional closure systems reflect the socioeconomic conditions of the communities that implement them? This thesis identified socioeconomic factors that may influence whether a community employs or maintains traditional management and prioritised 11 that could be collected within the research timeframe. These factors were population, size of the resource, distance to market, conflicts, settlement pattern, dependence on marine resources, modernisation, perceptions about the complexity of human-environment interactions, perceptions about the condition of the marine environment, social capital and occupational mobility. These socioeconomic factors were examined in 14 coastal communities in Papua New Guinea, five of which had traditional closures and nine of which did not. Data were collected using a combination of quantitative and qualitative techniques, including household surveys, key informant interviews, participant observation, and oral histories. A technique called Rasch modelling, commonly used in psychology and education, was employed to aggregate household-level socioeconomic indicators into thematic interval-level variables. Then the socioeconomic factors in the five communities that employ traditional closures of coral reefs were quantitatively compared with the nine communities that do not. Results showed that the constructs used to measure modernisation, social capital and occupational mobility had a slight but significant relationship to the presence of traditional closures, and the construct of dependence on marine resources was strongly related to the presence of traditional closures. Two case studies were used to provide a more detailed examination of how dependence on marine resources influences whether and how communities can employ a traditional closure. One case study is from Ahus Island, Manus province where dependence on marine resources is extremely high. The other is from Muluk village on Karkar Island, where dependence on marine resources is low. These contrasting case studies help to provide more detail into the socioeconomic context within which these traditional practices operate and how a community&#8217;s dependence on marine resources may determine whether and how traditional closures may meet their goals. The thesis concludes by exploring how traditional closures in Papua New Guinea focus on providing the communities with benefits rather than biodiversity conservation and examining how this leads to a fundamentally different resource governance model than we see in western fisheries management and resource conservation. This utilitarian model of conservation may have a place in the modern conservation context of many developing countries where the social and economic burdens of Western conservation models are unrealistic.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1294/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1294/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changes in the Great Barrier Reef since European settlement</field><field name="creator">Daley, Benjamin</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the results of research into the environmental history of the Great Barrier Reef since European settlement, with particular emphasis on the period from 1860 to 1970 for which comparatively little scientific information about this ecosystem has been collected. Few environmental histories of the Great Barrier Reef have been written; those that exist have made limited use of archival and oral history sources. My research used archival and oral history sources more extensively in order to write three narratives of changes in the coral reefs, islands and marine wildlife of the Great Barrier Reef. Recent scholarship within the sub-discipline of environmental history has acknowledged that the production of such narratives &#8211; that focus on the changing relationship between human societies and the environment &#8211; is an essential task of environmental historians. My narratives are based on detailed descriptions of environmental changes, collected using qualitative methods including textual analysis and semi-structured interviewing; those narratives constitute an interpretive account of numerous ways in which humans have used and modified the Great Barrier Reef between 1860 and 1970. Changes in coral reefs are described in the context of the geomorphological evolution of the east Australian continental shelf during the Holocene epoch, which resulted in deteriorating water quality and the progression of some reefs &#8211; especially nearshore reefs &#8211; from juvenile to senile geomorphological states. Subsequent natural and anthropogenic impacts have brought several of these vulnerable reefs close to critical ecological thresholds, beyond which their recovery from degradation is unlikely. My research has found evidence that early European reef fisheries, coral mining, coral collecting, shell collecting, the creation of access channels and tracks, and military impacts have degraded some coral reefs; I present evidence to indicate the extent of these various impacts. In particular, no accounts of historical coral mining and coral collecting in the Great Barrier Reef have previously been written, yet those activities resulted in the removal of considerable quantities of coral from many reefs over long periods of time. As a result, some coral reefs were probably far from pristine at the time of the formation of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) in 1975. Changes in many islands of the Great Barrier Reef have also been substantial: for example, the construction of the navigation beacon at Raine Island, the removal of guano from many islands, the destruction of native vegetation and fauna, the introduction of exotic species such as coconut palms and goats, and the development of infrastructure. Some islands have been significantly transformed as a result of these activities, including Raine Island, several islands of the Capricorn-Bunker Group, and the most accessible tourist resort islands in the Cairns, Townsville and Whitsunday areas. Considerable impacts have also occurred on some marine wildlife species, including the commercial fishing of dugongs and turtles in the Great Barrier Reef and in adjacent coastal waters. I provide reconstructions of the extent and impacts of those fisheries, based on analysis of the reports and records of various Queensland Government Departments together with oral history evidence. I also describe other changes in marine wildlife, including the effects of the commercial humpback whale fishery and the effects of Indigenous hunting of dugongs and turtles. Together, the three environmental history narratives contained in this thesis represent an account of almost continuous human exploitation of the Great Barrier Reef between 1860 and 1970 which probably amounts to considerable degradation of the ecosystem, at least in localised areas and for particular species. Consequently, my research has several implications for the contemporary environmental management of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA). I argue that the re-evaluation of some ecological baselines is necessary, as documentary and oral history evidence indicates that the Great Barrier Reef has been exploited earlier, for a longer period, in more locations and more intensively than has previously been documented. In particular, some coral reefs, islands and marine wildlife species require additional scientific research and monitoring &#8211; linked with agreed performance indicators &#8211; in order to ensure their effective conservation. In addition, I have evaluated the use of qualitative methods in environmental history research. While the coverage of documentary sources describing the Great Barrier Reef is uneven for the period before 1970, those sources contain rich information about environmental changes. In comparison, oral histories provided sparse data, although some evidence about coral mining was obtained only from oral history sources. My research indicates that the use of multiple methods can best inform accounts of environmental changes in the Great Barrier Reef.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1312/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1312/2/02chapters1-4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1312/3/03chapter5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1312/8/04chapter6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1312/9/05chapters7-8.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1312/10/06references.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1312/11/07appendices.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantitative and qualitative aspects of the protein nutrition of barramundi (Lates calcarifer) larvae fed formulated foods</field><field name="creator">Nankervis, Leo</field><field name="description">Formulated &#8216;artificial&#8217; diets have the potential to overcome inherent nutritional and financial drawbacks associated with live foods used for larvae fish culture. Artificial formulations also provide a vehicle for accurate manipulation of nutritional constituents, enabling investigations into the nutrient requirements of fish larvae. In order to develop species-specific larval food formulations, optimal macronutrient requirements and appropriate nutrient sources must be established. The nutritional value of a food ingredient is determined by its nutritional profile and nutrient availability, and therefore nutrient digestibility is an essential part of the evaluation of novel food ingredients. Since the proteolytic capacity of barramundi larvae is limited, optimal sources of dietary protein must be established to optimise both their amino acid profile, and protein digestibility. An integrated approach was therefore adopted in this study to evaluate protein sources for barramundi larvae in terms of their amino acid profile and digestibility and in their capacity to support optimal growth and survival when incorporated into food formulations. Furthermore, the endocrinal mediation of the nutritional control of growth is investigated through thyroid hormone analysis, and nutritional effects on digestive physiology are examined through pepsin development. The thyrotropic hormone system is a major regulatory mechanism for the control of growth in teleosts. Thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine, T3 and L-thyroxine, T4) mediate extrinsic processes, such as nutrition, to regulate growth in juvenile and adult fish, and are regulated by nutritional quality and quantity. While thyroid hormones regulate growth, survival, development and metamorphosis in fish larvae, data are lacking on an endocrine-nutrition link at the larval stage. By applying an endocrinal approach to the nutritional control of growth, we may achieve a better understanding of the underlying processes governing the physiological status of fish. The research described in this thesis was therefore designed to clarify the quantitative and qualitative protein requirement of barramundi, Lates calcarifer, larvae, and to investigate possible nutritional links to thyroid hormone concentration. Dietary protein and energy contents were initially manipulated in larval food formulations to determine baseline macronutrient inclusion levels. Barramundi larvae (14 days after hatch, DAH) were fed microbound diets (MBD), varying in gross dietary protein (45, 50 and 55%) and energy (18 and 21 MJ.kg-1) for a period of 14 days. All fish were then sacrificed, measured for total length and a sub-sample taken for dry weight analysis. Carcass T3 and T4 were measured by radioimmunoassay, following chloroform/NH3OH extraction. In following experiments, marine animal meals (fish meal, squid powder, Artemia meal, mussel meal, prawn meal and krill meal) were evaluated for their suitability for inclusion into MBD for barramundi larvae. Each of these meals was included in dietary formulations to a total of 50% gross protein. These formulations were evaluated in terms of growth and survival of barramundi larvae, amino acid composition of protein sources, protein digestibility and resulting carcass thyroid hormone levels. To improve the limited digestibility of fish meal, subsequent experiments incorporated fish meal hydrolysates and acid-denatured fish meal into MBD for evaluation in growth trials with barramundi larvae. An optimal diet was found to contain at least 21 MJ.kg-1 dietary energy and derived its protein from a combination of fish meal and squid powder (9:1 ratio). The limited digestibility of fish meal was improved approximately two-fold by acid denaturation, and the moderate inclusion of denatured fish meal into food formulations improved larval growth significantly, while the entire replacement of untreated fish meal with denatured fish meal did not improve growth above that of diets containing intact fish meal. The reasons for this are unclear, though carcass pepsin level was depressed for larvae fed the formulation containing no intact fish meal, indicating that larvae may adapt to less digestible protein sources. The high leaching rates typically attributed to MBD are assumed to be responsible for the poor growth and/or survival of larvae fed diets containing autolysates and hydrolysates in this study. Thyroid hormone levels had no direct correlation to dietary energy level, protein source or protein inclusion level, though T4 correlated with growth independently of these nutritional manipulations. This finding indicates that T4 is important in the growth process of barramundi larvae, but is not directly mediated by specific nutritional inputs. This study developed a microbound diet which supported up to 58% survival and significant growth in barramundi larvae from 14-28 DAH. The diet that supported the best rates of growth and survival contained 21 MJ.kg-1 utilisable dietary energy and at least 50% dietary protein, comprised of a 9:1 ratio of fish meal to squid powder. This study utilised integrated methodology to improve diet composition to increase growth and survival in barramundi larvae fed MBD, and to investigate the underlying mechanisms behind growth promotion. Growth trials remain the most conclusive way to determine optimal nutrient requirements for formulated foods, however, biochemical composition and physical properties can be used to narrow-down the wide range of nutrient sources available. Digestibility is of critical importance to the study of protein sources in food formulations for fish larvae, and a major area for the improvement of native animal meal protein sources. The diet developed in this study is a critical step in the development of species-specific weaning and larval diets for barramundi. Amino acid profiles for optimal growth have been refined, and the digestibility of fish meal has been increased to improve larval growth, thus potentiating early weaning protocols and diminishing Artemia requirements. The development of co-feeding and weaning protocols with this diet is expected to increase growth through optimised amino acid profile and increased energy and fatty acid availability, while reducing costs in barramundi hatcheries through reduced Artemia requirements.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1317/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1317/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behavioural ecology of Irrawaddy, Orcaella brevirostris (Owen in Gray, 1866), and Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins, Sousa chinensis (Osbeck, 1765), in northeast Queensland, Australia : a comparative study</field><field name="creator">Parra, Guido J.</field><field name="description">Irrawaddy dolphins, Orcaella brevirostris, and Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (hereafter humpback dolphins), Sousa chinensis, are two of the least known species of coastal dolphins found in the Indian and West Pacific Ocean region. Both species occur in sympatry throughout most of their range in Australian waters, where they have been little studied. As a result, the conservation status of Australian populations of Irrawaddy and humpback dolphins is unknown and conservation and management actions have been hampered by this lack of knowledge. To overcome this lack of knowledge and improve the capacity to effectively conserve and manage Australian populations of Irrawaddy and humpback dolphins, this study aimed to contribute information on different aspects of their behavioural ecology. As both species co-occur throughout most of their range in Australian waters, an additional aim of this study was to analyse the degree of ecological separation between them. This comparative approach served two purposes: 1) to provide species-specific information on different aspects of the behavioural ecology (e.g., habitat use, social structure) of these species, and 2) to provide insights into the mechanisms promoting their coexistence. Boat-based surveys were carried out in different areas along the east coast of Queensland between 1999-2002, focusing mainly in one area, Cleveland Bay Dugong Protected Area (hereafter referred as Cleveland Bay), where populations of both species are known to co-occur and where weather and logistical considerations allowed for almost year-round boat-based observations. Analysis of data on the spatial distribution of Irrawaddy and humpback dolphin schools along different areas along the east coast of Queensland indicated that the distribution of Irrawaddy and humpback dolphins was strongly influenced by proximity to the coast, with both species occurring closer to land than would be expected under a random scenario. When comparing between species, Irrawaddy dolphins occurred closer to river mouths than humpback dolphins, but this interspecific difference was not constant across study areas. Based on the spatial distribution of both species in the areas surveyed, I found that the existing protected areas may not include the most critical habitats for Irrawaddy and humpback dolphins. In Cleveland Bay, I found that Irrawaddy and humpback dolphins were present year round between 1999 and 2002. There was no evidence of variation in their occurrence with year or season. Irrawaddy and humpback dolphins used coastal waters of Cleveland Bay mainly for foraging activities indicating this area represents an important feeding area within their home range. I also found that Irrawaddy and humpback dolphins exhibit significantly different school dynamics, with Irrawaddy dolphins forming larger schools (mean &#177; SE = 5.3 &#177; 0.35) than humpback dolphins (mean &#177; SE = 3.5 &#177; 0.19). School of both species were mainly composed of adult individuals and, in proportion to the total number of animals within a school, Irrawaddy dolphins had a greater number of adults than humpback dolphin schools. Differences in school size and composition may be attributed to socioecological and phylogenetic factors. There is evidence from my studies that social as well as behavioural constraints may be responsible for these differences in school sizes. Analysis of the relative use of space by both species using kernel methods showed that Irrawaddy and humpback dolphins do not use Cleveland Bay uniformly. The representative ranges (95% kernel range) of Irrawaddy and humpback dolphins were similar in size and location covering mainly the area between the Port of Townsville and the mouth of the Black River. The area around the Port of Townsville was used heavily by both species and represented a core area of use (50% kernel range) for both Irrawaddy and humpback dolphins. Irrawaddy dolphins had another core area between the mouths of the Bohle and Black Rivers. The behaviour of Irrawaddy and humpback dolphins within and outside their core areas was dominated by foraging and travelling activities. The 95% representative ranges of Irrawaddy and humpback dolphins showed considerable spatial overlap (81%). Additionally, the Utilization Distibutions (UDs) of both species showed strong correlation (rs = 0.55, P &lt; 0.05), indicating strong concordance in the utilization patterns of shared areas by both species. Despite considerable overlap and concordance in space use patterns, Irrawaddy and humpback dolphins showed different habitat preferences. Within their representative range Irrawaddy dolphins preferred shallow (0-2 m) waters with seagrass meadows, and occurred closer to river mouths than humpback dolphins. Humpback dolphins showed preference for deeper waters (2-5 m deep), followed by waters close to the coast, shallow waters (1-2 m deep) with no seagrass, and dredge channels (5-15 m deep). I propose that these differences in habitat preference are important factors promoting the coexistence of Irrawaddy and humpback dolphins. I photo-identified 63 Irrawaddy dolphins and 54 humpback dolphins in Cleveland Bay. Analysis of monthly and annual sighting rates of identified animals indicated most individuals were not permanent residents in the bay, but most used the area from year to year. Irrawaddy and humpback dolphins identified in more than one year were mainly identified and re-identified during the dry season between May and September when greater survey effort was carried out. The low standard distance deviations of Irrawaddy and humpback dolphins sighted on eight or more occasions indicated that individuals of both species tended to come back to specific areas within Cleveland Bay. The observed sighting patterns of individual Irrawaddy and humpback dolphins fitted exponential models of emigration + reimmigration, indicating that some animals are permanent residents while others reimmigrate into the study area after certain periods of time. I suggest site fidelity patterns may reflect fluctuations in prey resource availability and levels of predation risk within Cleveland Bay. The ranges of individual animals of both species sighted on eight or more occasions were similar in size; length and location. Individual ranges of both species extended over similar areas, covering mainly the stretch of coastline southeast and northwest of the Port of Townsville. This pattern of interspecific overlap in range patterns indicated a lack of species-specific territories. Analysis of association patterns among identified individuals indicated that Irrawaddy and humpback dolphins were more frequently seen with a particular companion than would be expected by chance. Cluster analysis showed that individual Irrawaddy dolphins may form strong associations with more than one individual. Strong associations between humpback dolphins appeared to be limited to pairs of animals. The social model that best described this relationship suggested that at any one time an individual Irrawaddy dolphin had two types of associates: &#8220;constant companions&#8221; and &#8220;casual acquaintances&#8221;. The mean number of associates (constant companions + casual acquaintances) suggested by the model was approximately eight, of which four were constant companions. The fit of all social models to the data from humpback dolphins suggested a complex pattern of associations between individual humpback dolphins that may involve various associates with different levels of temporal stability. Differences in the social systems of both species could be explained by their different phylogenetic relationships among the Delphinidae and/or exposure to different levels of predation risk. Photo-identification data collected between 1999-2002 and open markrecapture models provided abundance estimates of Irrawaddy and humpback dolphins inhabiting the coastal waters of Cleveland Bay. Based on the open population model that best fitted the data, I estimated that less than a hundred individuals of each dolphin species used Cleveland Bay between 1999 and 2002. Based on historical data, it is certain that both species have been subject to anthropogenic mortality in the past due to entanglement in shark nets set for bather protection, and in commercial gillnets. A power analysis of the abundance estimates of both species and their associated variation indicated that, even with relatively unbiased and precise abundance estimates (CV = 0.08), population trends will be extremely difficult to detect within the space of a few years unless decreases in population size are worryingly high (&gt; 20% p.a.). Because of their small population sizes, Irrawaddy and humpback dolphins are particularly vulnerable to local extinction. Detection of population trends should not be a necessary criterion for enacting conservation measures of both species. My observations on the interspecific interactions among individuals of both species showed that encounters between Irrawaddy and humpback dolphins are common and predominantly of an aggressive/sexual nature in Cleveland Bay. The individuals involved in aggressive/sexual interactions appear to be mainly adult-male humpback dolphins and adult-female Irrawaddy dolphins with calves. During these encounters, humpback dolphins were dominant in initiating chasing, and seeking physical contact with Irrawaddy dolphins, while the latter tried to swim away or showed resistance to the interaction. I suggest the predominant aggressive/sexual interactions observed may reflect: 1) a physical training or skill development function that would have beneficial effects for future interactions between male humpback dolphins and their female conspecifics; 2) a mechanistic basis for some competitive interactions and patterns of resource partitioning between these two species of coastal dolphins; and 3) a relative scarcity of female humpback dolphins. This study is the first comprehensive investigation of Irrawaddy and humpback dolphins in the Australian/Papua New Guinean region. The information collected provides a preliminary scientific basis for their future conservation and management. Given the certainty that the continuing loss of global biodiversity will be particularly severe in coastal ecosystems, the conservation and management of Irrawaddy and humpback dolphins will need to be intensive and adaptive. The potential for the conservation and management of Irrawaddy and humpback dolphin populations along the Queensland coast is relatively good. However, in view of the concerns raised in this study about the long-term survival of these two species, and evidence that Australian populations of Irrawaddy and humpback dolphins represent different species/subspecies from populations elsewhere, future research directed at enhancing our ecological knowledge throughout Queensland and other areas of their range in Australia will be essential to inform their conservation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1318/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1318/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population genetics of dugongs around Australia : implications of gene flow and migration</field><field name="creator">McDonald, Brenda J</field><field name="description">Dugongs (Dugong dugon) live in tropical inshore areas around Northern Australia and throughout the Indo-West Pacific. These marine mammals are obligate seagrass feeders and are thus largely restricted in distribution to areas of seagrass habitat. The turbid environment and the lack of a dorsal fin for individual identification makes it impractical to study these animals using standard observational methods. Consequently very little is known about dugong population structure and migration patterns. From satellite tracking of individuals and aerial surveys it appears that dugongs, like many other marine mammals, can move long distances, but the timing and length of movements vary individually. If dugongs move and mate in their new locality, there will be substantial gene flow across large spatial scales and very little population differentiation around the tropical Australian coast. However, if dugongs maintain a home range and are philopatric (i.e. any long distance movements are for food or other reasons not including mating), then there would be very limited gene flow and substantial structuring among populations. In order to ascertain which pattern of population structure is present in the dugong, I used a variety of molecular techniques to assess dugong population genetic structure around the North Australian coast.
 A comparison of the two published mitochondrial genomes of dugongs showed that most variation was contained within the control region. I subsequently characterised the entire control region of eight individual dugongs (four available from previous studies and four sequenced in this study) and identified the amount of variation among them. I also made a comparison of the mitochondrial control region of dugongs with available sequences of their closest relatives, the paenungulates (Proboscidea, Hyracoidea, and other members of the Sirenia), in order to assess whether the control region was capable of producing reasonable phylogenies and its usefulness as a marker for phylogeographic and population studies on the dugong.
 The 5&#8217; domain of the control region was identified as the most appropriate section of this locus for use in the phylogeographic analysis. This domain demonstrates high diversity in the dugong. Phylogeographic analysis of the 492 bp alignment of 115 dugongs, identified two divergent Australian mitochondrial lineages. I hypothesise that the Australian lineages diverged historically during periods of low sea level that would have reduced habitat availability and produced geological barriers such as the Torres
 Strait land bridge between Northern Australia and Papua New Guinea. One lineage is restricted geographically to the coast of Queensland and into the Northern Territory, while the other is more widespread occurring from Shark Bay in Western Australia to Moreton Bay in Queensland (i.e. across the entire Australian range). The widespread lineage is poorly represented in Southeastern Queensland. Given the availability of continuous habitat with higher sea level for the past 7000 years and the high mobility of dugongs, I expected that more complete geographic mixing of lineages would have occurred. Mitochondrial DNA sequences of dugongs from Asia are distinct from those of Australian dugongs. These results suggest long-term isolation between dugong lineages and subsequent partial geographic mixing of dugong matrilines.
 Nuclear DNA microsatellite loci isolated from the Florida manatee were tested for use as population genetic markers the dugong. These loci displayed considerable allelic diversity in the dugong, significantly greater than observed in the Florida manatee. For example, 27 alleles were identified in the dugong at locus TmaA04, while only one allele was identified in the Florida manatee at the same locus. These microsatellite markers reveal a high level of gene flow among dugongs in Australia and a significant level of isolation-by-distance across Australia.
 Comparison of the results from mtDNA and nDNA indicate that members of the two distinct mitochondrial lineages within Australia interbreed in areas where they overlap geographically. The contrasting patterns of structure presented by the mtDNA and nDNA suggest male-biased gene flow in the dugong. This pattern has not yet been identified from ecological studies, but is consistent with common dispersal patterns in mammals.
 The major findings of this study are the detection of &#8216;healthy&#8217; levels of genetic diversity of Australian dugongs, a suggestion of male-biased gene flow, and a demonstration of significant gene flow around Australia. This high level of gene flow makes the allocation of management units difficult. These results indicate the importance of a co-ordinated management strategy at a spatial scale of thousands of kilometres. Dugongs within Australia cannot be managed at a bay level due to the connectivity between bays observed in this study. Co-operation between management agencies at local, state, national and international spatial scales is required in order to conserve this vulnerable species.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1327/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1327/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Petrogenesis of Mount Dore-style breccia-hosted copper &#177; gold mineralization in the Kuridala-Selwyn region of northwestern Queensland</field><field name="creator">Beardsmore, Trevor John</field><field name="description">Mount Dore-style breccia-hosted copper-gold deposits define a 70 kilometre-long, north-trending
 lineament from Kuridala (65 kilometres south of Cloncurry), southwards. The type deposit lies 130
 kilometres south of Cloncurry, and a detailed study of it was undertaken to produce a metallogenic model
 applicable (with suitable modifications) to all deposits having this style.
 Regional geology results from a combination of (i) at least two cycles of ensialic rift
 sedimentation, (ii) later compressional tectonics and associated metamorphism to a maximum middle
 amphibolite grade, and (iii) intrusion of late-tectonic granitoids (Beardsmore et al., 1988 and Newbery et
 al., in prep.). Mount Dore-style deposits are largely restricted to rocks of the upper part of the Middle
 Proterozoic Maronan Supergroup, a newly-recognized package of rift-basin sediments. The precise age of
 this unit is presently unknown; it could belong to either rift episode, or be older or younger.
 The Mount Dore deposit occurs within steeply east-dipping quartz-muscovite schists and
 carbonaceous slates of the uppermost Maronan Supergroup structurally overlying meta-calcarenites,
 calcilutites, marbles and metabasalts of the Staveley Formation. The structural history includes early,
 subhorizontal (D1) detachment of the Staveley Formation from older units, followed by upright, northtrending,
 tight to isoclinal folding (D2), accompanied by peak metamorphism in the lower to middle
 amphibolite facies (Jaques et al., 1982). The events are tentatively dated at 1545 Ma, by analogy with D2
 and metamorphic history derived for the western part of the Mount Isa Inlier (Page and Bell, 1986).
 Northwest-trending corridors of open, upright folds belonging to the D3 deformation event are scattered
 across the region, and one of these passes through the Mount Dore orebody. Latest tectonism produced the
 Mount Dore Fault Zone, a moderately- to steeply east-dipping reverse fault-zone about 250 metres wide,
 which passes through Mount Dore and reactivates the D1 structure. The fault zone contains a thin sliver of
 uppermost Maronan Supergroup, sandwiched between footwall Staveley Formation and hangingwall
 (truncated) Mount Dore Granite. The granite is dated at 1510 Ma (Nisbet et al., 1983).
 Mount Dore displays a complex history of brecciation and alteration. Both are related to
 movement along the Mount Dore Fault Zone and to associated hydrothermal activity. Brecciation was a
 continuum process, with any particular "event" first producing angular, commonly tabular, crenulated
 schistose fragments. The crenulation is identified with S3, but is randomly orientated from clast to clast,
 arguing for post-D3 brecciation. Subsequent reworking of the early fragments involved tectonic and
 hydrothermal milling. Replacement and infill in the breccias are extensive. Early alteration produced Kfeldspar
 (or biotite), tourmaline, sericite and quartz. Later alteration produced carbonate (dolomite and
 calcite), apatite and chlorite. All phases are associated with all brecciation styles, but the most pervasive
 alteration is associated with the intensively milled breccias.
 Sulphide mineralization is associated temporally with carbonate alteration, and occurs late in the
 history of development of the Mount Dore deposit. Primary sulphide mineralization comprises pyrite and
 chalcopyrite, with minor sphalerite and galena. Pyrite is early, and is replaced by the other phases.
 Chalcocite also clearly replaces earlier pyrite, but is restricted to shallow depths, and probably formed by
 deep leaching of the deposit during Recent weathering. Alteration, fluid inclusion and stable isotope geochemistry identify a primary deep-seated, hot
 (&gt;500oC?), oxidized, CO2-bearing, highly-saline (65-70 wt% salt) metamorphic or magmatic fluid
 containing K+, Na+, Fe2+, Ca2+, B, SiO2, H+, Cl- and possibly SO2. After initial separation and loss of an
 immiscible CO2-rich phase, the residual aqueous fluid became more dilute with time, probably by mixing
 with cooler, lower salinity (&lt;20 wt% salt), low-CO2 fluid, possibly also of metamorphic origin. A model
 accounting for mineralization at Mount Dore invokes dilation and hydraulic brecciation during movement
 along the Mount Dore Fault Zone, where the fault intersects D3 "corridors" of shallowly-dipping bedding
 and S2 foliation. Early potassic and silicic alteration released ore metals (Cu, Pb, Zn, Ag, Co, U, Au) to the
 fluid from the host rocks at this time. Sulphide precipitation was controlled by sulphate reduction with
 carbon released from host. Pyrite scavenged most of this, and later Cu-, Pb- and Zn-sulphides formed by
 scavenging of S from pyrite.
 Data concerning other Mount Dore-style deposits (Mount Elliott, S.W.A.N., Hampden) are
 limited, but suggest they may have formed by similar processes, with superficial differences arising from
 variations in geological setting. These deposits apparently all formed during a single metallogenic event
 related to late tectonism in the eastern part of the Mount Isa Inlier. A speculative regional model proposes
 emplacement of at least one large allochthonous slab of Maronan Supergroup over the carbonate-evaporite
 successions of the Mary Kathleen Group. The latter passed highly saline, CO2-bearing connate and
 prograde metamorphic fluids upwards into and along the decollement. Subsequent upright to inclined F2
 antiforms may have ponded these fluids, allowing them to "stew" for some time in contact with relatively
 metal-rich rocks in the overriding plate. Alternatively, or additionally, the fluid may have migrated
 dissolved in Williams Batholith magmas, which were produced by partial melting of deep crustal material
 probably at the peak of regional metamorphism. Eventual release of hydrothermal fluid to higher crustal
 levels occurred only when vapour separation occurred in the rising plutons, and when permeable, latetectonic
 reverse faults, which also controlled the solid-state emplacement of at least some of the plutons,
 breached F2 structures. Passing rapidly upwards along the faults, the fluids encountered local dilatant
 zones, where high fluid fluxes and rapidly changing physical and chemical conditions instigated extensive
 alteration and sulphide precipitation. Low salinity fluids of meteoric, or more likely upper-plate
 metamorphic derivation also migrated into the dilatant zones when the deeply penetrating fault structures
 became available, and subsequently mixed with the saline fluids, perhaps initiating some styles of
 mineralization in the process.
 Epigenetic mineralization across the Cloncurry Fold Belt (and perhaps the entire Mount Isa Inlier)
 appears to be the result of large-scale devolatilization of the crust during the waning stages of regional
 deformation and metamorphism. The characteristics of individual deposits depends on the combination of
 local factors such as structure and rock types available adjacent to these structures for leaching of metals.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1344/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1344/2/02chapters1-2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1344/3/03chapter3_-_Part_1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1344/4/04chapter3_-_Part_2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1344/8/05chapter4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1344/9/06chapter5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1344/12/07chapter6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1344/13/08chapter7.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1344/14/09references.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1344/15/10appendicesA-D.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1344/16/11appendicesE-G.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology of chytridiomycosis, an emerging infectious disease of Australian rainforest frogs</field><field name="creator">Woodhams, Douglas Craig</field><field name="description">In the wet tropics of Queensland, Australia eight species of stream dwelling frogs have experienced population declines, and individuals have been found with fungal infections of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, an emerging infectious disease of amphibians. I examined infection prevalence in stream frog assemblages and determined that amphibian chytrid infection is now endemic and persists in adults and tadpoles of declining and non-declining species at all eight streams surveyed. Infection prevalence varied among species, and between adult and tadpole life history stages, seasons, and elevations. Prevalences were higher during the dry season (May to September) and at high elevations (600-800 m). Tadpoles of Litoria nannotis, L. rheocola, and Mixophyes shevilli may be carrier hosts in this system; they have infection prevalences between 48 and 76%, and appear to be resistant to disease. Non-carrier hosts may include adults of all species and tadpoles of some species, with infection prevalence below 10%. I found no relationships between infection prevalence and body condition, fluctuating asymmetry of hind limbs, population density, or the presence of metamorphosing tadpoles and juvenile frogs. I examined how environmental temperature and moisture regimes influenced the chytrid pathogen on frog hosts and in culture. Infected Litoria chloris juveniles survived at the lowest rates in constant mist and constant 20&#176;C conditions, but frogs in constant dry or rain conditions survived longer. All frogs exposed to 37&#176;C on days 12 and 13 after infection survived in good health for 9 mo after infection, and were found to be free of infection. I modelled growth of chytrid populations using in vitro experiments to estimate the parameters zoospore production, zoospore survival rate, zoospore settlement rate, and time to sporulation of sporangia. The chytrid lifecycle may be faster at higher temperatures (23&#176;C) than at lower temperatures (8&#176;C), but relatively greater production of zoospores and better survival rates at lower temperatures may cause chytrid colonies to grow faster under cold conditions. In addition to environmental effects, host immune function and behaviour may also alter host-pathogen dynamics. I found that leukocyte populations in juvenile Litoria chloris responded to infection but not to environmental conditions. Skin peptide immune defences were more effective in common species (Litoria lesueuri, Litoria genimaculata, Mixophyes shevilli) and less effective in some endangered species (Litoria rheocola, Nyctimystes dayi). Skin peptide defences against the chytrid were also better in those species that showed greater survival when experimentally infected with B. dendrobatidis. Environmental conditions may also affect skin peptide immune response, with poorer responses under colder conditions. The behaviour of captive Litoria chloris juveniles varied with thermal and hydric environments and time of day, but not infection status. Litoria genimaculata tadpole behaviour did vary with infection status; tadpoles exposed to chytrid sporangia showed a behavioural fever of 6.2 to 7.1&#176;C. The conservation status of the rainforest stream frog species examined was correlated with their ranking on a disease risk assessment of behaviour; however, their current infection prevalence is not well correlated with disease risk. This agrees with epidemiological theory, which suggests that a disease involved in population declines should be present in both common and endangered species, but should have higher infection prevalence in species with stable populations. These stable species are also less at risk from chytridiomycosis based on behavioural and immunological assessments. The emergence of chytridiomycosis may occur when a particular host-pathogen interaction is achieved involving the complex arrangement of species assemblage structure and environmental conditions.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1352/1/01front.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Economic assessment of agricultural pollution management options in sugar cane production in Queensland : a case study involving a dugong protection area</field><field name="creator">Jacobsen, Ben</field><field name="description">Sugar cane production inevitably creates off-site environmental impacts. This thesis addresses the joint production of an agricultural good and environmental externalities and investigates options to manage transboundary effects. Sugar production activities upstream of a marine protected area may alter the natural setting and impose costs on individuals and society that are not offset by commensurate increases in benefits. Expanding the Burdekin River Irrigation Area in North Queensland to supply the Molongle Block would bring areas adjacent to Upstart Bay Dugong Protection Area under cane production with the potential to create net social costs. Irrigated cane production might introduce dry season flows and pollution carried by water, affecting the ecological value of dugong (Dugong dugon) habitat. The thesis examines why environmental damage might occur in the coastal region and explores some of the mechanisms that might be used to better minimise problems. The original contribution is an economic analysis of Dugong Protection Areas, identifying appropriate mechanisms for intervention. A case study of potential cane production adjacent to Upstart Bay is used to explore agricultural pollution mitigation policy options. Constructed wetlands are one option, employing biological processes to mitigate agricultural pollutants. The problem of handling variable loading rates to avoid intertemporal ineffectiveness would lead to high cost mitigation. Controlling the timing of pollutant loadings via retention ponds may be a more cost effective alternative. Retarding dry season flows and first flush events for release in subsequent high flow events is expected to provide reductions in environmental impacts. Subregional retention ponds allow for effective coordination of the timing of wastewater releases and may also have economies of scale advantages. Integrating agricultural production and ecological criteria in economic analysis of policy options revealed shortcomings in available datasets. Gaps in knowledge constrain a full evaluation of mitigation policy, but reflect a situation commonly encountered in natural resource management. Some existing planning tools could be used as a basis for pollution mitigation. The Coastal Protection and Management Act 1995 might be used to strengthen the environmental aspects of land and water management plans required by the Queensland Water Act 2000. Property level drainage outflow points may allow for effective monitoring of water quality. The strategic location of drainage outflow points in a new irrigation development could address measurement problems hindering effective responses. Instruments which might be worthwhile interventions include traditional regulatory approaches and market based instruments. Instruments such as tradeable permits linked to a regional mitigation infrastructure have the potential to further reduce the pollution risk at the lowest social cost. The first challenge in establishing a marketable permit system that creates an incentive to reduce pollution is the setting of limits for the aggregate quantity of pollution permissible. In considering the potential implications of the case study for the sugar growing industry as a whole, more parameters become relevant for policy analysis. A whole of catchment approach similar to the Productivity Commission investigation of policy options for water quality and the Great Barrier Reef lagoon (2003) provides a framework to address complex land use issues affecting the land-marine interface. It is argued that policy options that inherently create incentives to reveal private information aligning private interests with desired environmental outcomes and allow for site variability must feature as part of the abatement policy mix. Finding ways to lever community capacity to implement policy options and ensure desired environmental outcomes through adopting some targeted regulatory options remains the challenge for agricultural pollution mitigation policy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1353/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1353/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impacts of agriculture and restoration of the habitat values, water quality and fish assemblages of a tropical floodplain</field><field name="creator">Perna, Colton Nicholas</field><field name="description">Fish assemblages in two floodplain sub-catchments of the Burdekin River, north
 Queensland, were examined over two years, in relation to habitat condition water quality and
 the effects of habitat rehabilitation. The main study sites were located along Sheep Station Ck
 and Warren&#8217;s Gully which are overflow channels or sub-catchments of the Burdekin delta.
 Artificially high flows are maintained in these streams as water from the Burdekin River is
 pumped through them to supply downstream irrigation needs. In general, the study sites were
 moderately to highly impacted by riparian clearing, modified flow regimes and weed
 infestations. Weed infestations appeared to be linked with the imposition of a modified flow
 regime as remnant sites had far less cover of weeds than sites with modified flow. Sites in the
 upper floodplain, Burdekin River and Barratta Ck had highest habitat values.
 Water quality was highly variable across sites, streams and over time. Oxygen
 concentration was identified as a major determinant of fish diversity, so the dynamics of
 dissolved oxygen were a major focus of this study. Flow, habitat condition and weed infestation
 were identified as the main drivers of oxygen in the streams. The introduced Water hyacinth
 (Eichhornia crassipes) had a major impact on oxygen as it essentially blocks oxygen exchange
 with the water. Modified flows appear to benefit weed growth, through continuous nutrient
 supply. Loss of riparian habitat improves growing conditions for weeds and increases water
 temperature, further impacting oxygen content in the water.
 Habitat condition had a major influence on fish assemblages. Species richness and
 abundance were highest in sites of good habitat condition. Sites within the distribution systems
 (Sheep Station Ck and Warren&#8217;s Gully) had the most impacted fish assemblages. The
 abundances of exotic species (both real and relative) decreased with increase in habitat
 condition. The most abundant fish species were (i) small, highly tolerant gudgeons, (ii) the
 introduced Mosquito fish (Gambusia holbrooki) and (iii) larger Tarpon (Megalopes
 cyprinoides), which is a facultative air breather. The small species appeared to favour degraded
 lagoon habitats but it appears that as habitat condition improves and more predatory species
 occur, the abundance of these small species decreases.
 During the sampling period a local project was initiated using an aquatic weed harvester
 to remove weed infestations from lagoons on Sheep Station Ck Weeds were harvested from
 Payard&#8217;s Lagoon in August 2000. Three samples were taken before weed removal and six after
 weed removal to examine temporal changes in fish assemblages and water quality. There was
 an immediate improvement in oxygen content in the month after weed removal and this improvement persisted for a further year. The abundance of native fish species increased
 rapidly after weed removal. Gudgeons were the most abundant. Over the study period these
 abundances gradually declined due largely to the re-colonisation by predators, previously
 excluded from the lagoon by poor habitat and water quality condition. A number of species
 moved into the experimental site from a refuge site in the inlet and during a flood event. The
 most notable of these species is Bony bream (Nematalosa erebi), a species that is very intolerant
 of hypoxia. As more natural native habitat conditions re-established, the abundance of exotic
 species (G. holbrooki) decreased. However, fish assemblages could not fully return to natural
 because of combined barriers to access by estuarine species (e.g., flow control devices, bund
 walls and hypoxic lagoons), and poor linkage to remnant refuges.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1354/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1354/2/02chapter1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1354/3/03chapter2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1354/4/04chapters3-6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1354/5/05references.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biogeography of coral reef shore gastropods in the Philippines</field><field name="creator">Vallejo, Benjamin</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to describe the distribution of coral reef and shore gastropods in the Philippines, using the species rich taxa, Nerita, Clypeomorus, Muricidae, Littorinidae, Conus and Oliva. These taxa represent the major gastropod groups in the intertidal and shallow water ecosystems of the Philippines. This distribution is described with reference to the McManus (1985) basin isolation hypothesis of species diversity in Southeast Asia. I examine species-area relationships, range sizes and shapes, major ecological factors that may affect these relationships and ranges, and a phylogeny of one taxon. Range shape and orientation is largely determined by geography. Large ranges are typical of mid-intertidal herbivorous species. Triangular shaped or narrow ranges are typical of carnivorous taxa. Narrow, overlapping distributions are more common in the central Philippines. The frequency of range sizes in the Philippines has the right skew typical of tropical high diversity systems. This shows that there are many species with small range sizes, and suggests a tendency for these ranges to overlap. The species area curves are consistent with predictions of basin isolation on species richness. The central Philippine basins (Visayas and, Sibuyan) have a z estimate (a parameter of the Species Area relationship or SPAR) close to unity (0.59-1.30). This contributes to biogeographical provinciality (a measure of faunal uniqueness) in these basins. The basin that is most provincial is the Sibuyan Sea basin. However this provinciality may also be due to a small-area effect or the decoupling of species richness with area as a result of habitat heterogeneity within the basin. Endemicity of taxa is observed mainly in the central, as opposed to the peripheral, oceanic basins. A regression approach was applied to test the effects of larval duration and habitat availability on range size and species richness of Conus. The results suggest that habitat is a more significant factor in determining species ranges and species richness than larval duration. This supports the suggestion from basin isolation for an important effect of habitat heterogeneity on range size and species richness. . Extinction rate estimates are negative for the Philippines and other areas in the Indo-West pacific (IWP). This suggests that species in the Philippine basins, and the IWP in general, have been accumulating in these areas over the past 18,000 years. In Conus, the mode of speciation was inferred from a published molecular phylogeny, coupled with data on modern ranges. This study also tried to infer Conus speciation within the IWP. The relationship of modern ranges and phylogenetic information is not informative, and does not provide inferences on the mode or location of speciation. The ranges and phylogenetic patterns of Conus suggest that changes in range extents have been large during the evolution of the genus. This may be due to the long larval duration, that allows for wide dispersal, being largely conserved during Conus evolution. In the sand-dwelling coral reef genus Oliva, the ranges and species area curves were similar to those of Conus.. The central Philippines basin of the Sibuyan Sea has the highest degree of provinciality. The area of the OGU (geographical regions) affects species richness of Oliva significantly This observation is consistent with results of a PCA ordination of the frequency of occurrence of Oliva. The presence of sandy habitats affect Oliva species richness significantly. The morphological diversity of two widely distributed species of Oliva was studied. Monotopic species (species that are found only in a single substrate type) tend to show morphologies that are found only in certain oceanic basins. Modern ranges suggest basin isolation as an historical process that has maintained and possibly caused the high taxonomic diversity of intertidal and shallow water gastropods in the IWP. There is evidence that high species diversity in IWP is likely related to the existence of numerous habitats. The geological histories of the Philippine oceanic basins may provide important information in future biogeographic studies of patterns of species richness. The evidence is considered with respect to current molecular phylogenetic studies of gastropods. The study highlights the paradox of low endemism in a highly diverse region. Suggestions are made for future research that could provide insight into the nature of endemism and species persistence of marine organisms in the IWP.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1357/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1357/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The provision of canopy bridges to reduce the effects of linear barriers on arboreal mammals in the Wet Tropics of northeastern Queensland</field><field name="creator">Weston, Nigel Graeme</field><field name="description">In 1995, Queensland Environmental Protection Agency personnel designed and built an inexpensive aerial connection (canopy bridge) across a rainforest road near Cairns in northeast Queensland. This was done in response to studies showing that habitat fragmentation caused by roads was isolating animal populations and impeding genetic interchange. Tree-dwelling species appeared to be particularly susceptible and it was reported that canopy connections were probably crucial for some rare species in the Wet Tropics. The canopy bridge was subsequently promoted by the Main Roads Department, among others, as a means of encouraging safe fauna movement across road corridors in the region. As the effectiveness of these had not yet been determined, it was recommended that canopy bridge trials be undertaken. A review of the existing scientific literature and secondary sources revealed that the first bridge for arboreal mammals was built in 1963 in Longview, Washington State, United States, to promote the safe crossing of a busy highway by squirrels. Since then, crossing structures have been erected in at least ten countries. These range from simple ropeways to more elaborate structures. As of this writing, at least four canopy bridges are being trialled or considered for use in Australia. The trials I conducted at the existing bridge near Cairns, using methods such as spotlighting, analyses of hair and faecal pellet samples and remote photography, demonstrated that at least five arboreal and scansorial mammal species were using it to cross the rainforest road. When it became clear that arboreal species were indeed using the existing bridge as a crossing route, additional studies were initiated. These were designed to test whether design and position influenced usage of the bridges by arboreal mammals. Two simplified bridges were erected along an abandoned snig track near Millaa Millaa on the Atherton Tablelands. This decision was based on several factors including prior knowledge of arboreal mammal assemblages within the area and the presence of suitable vegetation. Another consideration was the narrow configuration of the track resulting in overlapping tree canopies that were unlikely to impede the movement of arboreal mammal species. The animals generally preferred to use the natural crossings with only two verified crossing events recorded. One of the simplified bridges used over the snig track was subsequently removed, lengthened and installed along an old highway between Millaa Millaa and Ravenshoe on the Atherton Tablelands. The most important consideration in this instance was the configuration of the road corridor &#8211; it was of a sufficient width and length to represent a likely impediment or heightened risk for the movement of arboreal mammals. Although it took five months for a verified crossing event to occur, these events increased in frequency the longer the trial continued until they became commonplace. In total, 52 completed crossing events involving at least four arboreal mammal species were recorded over an 80-hour period. Thirty-five involved rainforest ringtails, 16 involved brushtails, one a striped possum and another an unidentified small mammal. This equates to a crude possum-crossing rate of one every 1.5 hours. However, the rate increases to approximately one possum-crossing every hour when the time between the bridge being installed and the first crossing event (presumably a period of familiarisation) is discounted and to just under three crossings per hour over the final twelve hours of direct observation at the site. It remains unclear how many individual animals made the crossing, although repeat sightings of the same individual were likely. A constraint of this study was that replication was impossible due to financial and bureaucratic constraints. However, a pilot study such as this was needed to provide insight before a more large-scale highly replicated study could be attempted. The study showed that arboreal and scansorial mammals would use canopy bridges to cross roads in the Wet Tropics region, especially where no canopy connectivity remains. It could therefore be argued that the conservation of some arboreal species would benefit from canopy bridges becoming a standard feature of road design. Canopy bridges could also become tourist attractions and raise community awareness about the dual problem of roadkill and habitat fragmentation. In this way, canopy bridges have the potential to pay an important role in the presentation and transmission of World Heritage values in the Wet Tropics.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1358/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1358/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a sustainable indigenous fishery for dugongs in Torres Strait : a contribution of empirical data analysis and process</field><field name="creator">Kwan, Donna</field><field name="description">Given the globally threatened status of dugongs and the fact that Torres Strait supports the world's largest

 This study investigated, within a biological context, the major factors (i.e., those additional to biological)
 that determine sustainability of the traditional dugong fishery in Torres Strait.
 
 My thesis had the following specific aims:
 
 (1) To provide information relevant to the development of community-based management for the dugong
 fishery in Torres Strait by:
 describing and quantifying the major factors that affect hunting pattern, hunting effort, hunting
 success and harvest levels in the major dugong hunting community of Mabuiag Island, and
 estimating the life history parameters of Torres Strait dugongs at the time of my study, and (i)
 comparing them with parameters obtained from parallel studies of dugong life history and
 reproductive biology in order to gain insights into the factors influencing these aspects of dugong
 ecology, and (ii) incorporating them into population models to predict the natural rate of change
 in the size of the population in the absence of hunting mortality.
 
 (2) To assist in the development of community-based management in Torres Strait through contributing to
 capacity building by actively involving Torres Strait Islanders in my research and training them in the
 collection of catch statistics and biological samples from dugongs.
 
 The fieldwork for this project was undertaken primarily at Mabuiag Island between September 1997 and
 November 1999 inclusive. All data and specimens from 127 female and 51 male dugongs were collected
 from animals butchered for food by Torres Strait Islander hunters.
 
 Being able to live and work within the Mabuiag Island community provided me with the rare opportunity to
 develop a relationship with Islanders built upon the mutual trust, co-operation and commitment. Involving
 Islanders as active participants in my research allowed me to collect the valuable specimens on which my
 information is based. The active involvement of hunters and community members enhanced their
 development of a sound understanding of and trust in the information I obtained. By training Torres Strait Islanders as research assistants, 1 also increased the capacity of the community to actively participate in
 future research, monitoring and management programs for dugongs.
 
 This study provided the opportunity to identify the main factors which impact catch rates of dugongs by
 Islanders. Only four to five hunters were responsible for 79% and 75% of the 145 and 170 dugongs taken
 at Mabuiag lsland during March to October in 1998 and 1999, respectively. The magnitude of the dugong
 catch was influenced by ecological, economic environmental and social factors that affected the temporal
 and spatial nature of hunting effort and hunting success.
 
 When my results were compared with those of other studies using similar techniques, I showed that the
 age and size at sexual maturity and first reproduction, pregnancy rates of female dugongs and the sex
 ratio of their young exhibit considerable variability in both space and time. The age and size at sexual
 maturity and first reproduction of male dugongs exhibit similar variability. At Mabuiag lsland in 1997-99,
 female dugongs reached sexual maturity between six or seven and fourteen years and at body lengths of
 between 2.05 and 2.58 m. Male dugongs reached sexual maturity between four and thirteen years and at
 body lengths between 1.90 and 2.57 m. Calving intervals of adult female dugongs from Mabuiag lsland in
 1998-99 ranged between 2.4 f s.e. 0.3 to 3.3 f s.e. 0.5 years. The parameters from Mabuiag lsland in
 1997-98 are thus the lowest recorded for dugongs. At Mabuiag lsland in 1997-98, almost all sexually
 mature nulliparous females were either pregnant andlor lactating and the sex ratio of foetuses was 1:3 in
 favour of males.
 
 Variability in life history parameters such as age at sexual maturity and first reproduction, pregnancy rates
 and calving intervals in dugongs is likely to result from spatial and temporal variation in seagrass
 community composition and biomass. Thus, food quality and availability influence dugong population
 dynamics. When their seagrass food disappears as a result of episodic disturbance, some dugongs
 suspend breeding. It is likely that the effects of food supply on life history parameters and hence fecundity
 in dugongs includes both density dependent and density independent components. The gaps in the age
 composition of the catch from Mabuiag in 1997-99 together with the low pregnancy rates of animals
 caught in the Daru market at that time suggest that a seagrass dieback in Torres Strait in the late 1970s
 had significant effects on dugong recruitment. These links between seagrass food availability and dugong
 life history parameters have very important implications for management given the dugong's susceptibility
 to large-scale episodic losses of seagrass.
 
 Several findings in this study highlight that a regional approach to management will be required because
 the potential for episodic or longer-tern over-harvesting can be exacerbated in the event of a combination
 of: low dugong fecundity as a result of extensive seagrass dieback events such as that reported in the 1970s; movements of dugongs close to hunting communities to feed on intertidal seagrass in response to
 dieback of deepwater communities exacerbating high hunting pressure; increase in hunting pressure in
 response to reduction in important sources of income such as the cray fishery.
 
 Management coordinated at a regional scale must include the Northern Peninsula Area of Cape York and
 PNG. Management will need to build on established processes which incorporate Ailan Kast'om (the
 customary way of life of Torres Strait Islanders) and institutional structures in the Torres Strait region
 which include the: Torres Sfraif Treafy, Torres Sfraif Fisheries Acf (1984), Native Title and regional
 Islander initiatives such as MaSTERS (Marine Strategy for Torres Strait).
 
 A community-based management approach, which builds on the research processes, and the empirical
 information obtained in this study, has considerable potential to ensure that the Torres Strait dugong
 fishery is sustainable. The challenge now is to build on information and trust generated by this project by
 enabling Islanders to use these results to develop and implement appropriate management plans for their
 dugong resources.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1376/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1376/2/02chapters1-2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1376/3/03chapters3-5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1376/4/04chapters6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1376/5/05chapters7.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1376/6/06chapters8-10.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1376/7/07references.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1376/8/08appendices.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The microstructural and metamorphic history preserved within garnet porphyroblasts from southern Vermont and northwestern Massachusetts</field><field name="creator">Gavin, Bronwyn Patricia</field><field name="description">Garnet porphyroblasts from southern Vermont and northwestern Massachusetts typically preserve multiple generations of inclusion trails, reflecting a potentially complex deformation and metamorphic growth history. Textural discontinuities, such as inclusion trail truncations or deflection planes, are commonly preserved within these complex inclusion trails and they are dominantly sub-vertically and sub-horizontally oriented. This observation cannot be adequately explained using the rotational model of spiral inclusion trail formation, leading to the conclusion that the trails were formed by the inclusion of multiple sub-vertical and sub-horizontal foliations during episodic garnet growth without porphyroblast rotation. Foliation inflection/intersection axes preserved within porphyroblasts (FIAs) provide important information about the kinematics of deformation, particularly the direction of bulk shortening at the time they formed. Samples from this study preserve a succession of six FIA sets resulting from a progressive change in the direction of bulk shortening through time. The distribution of these FIA sets across the field area indicates that the deformation was heterogeneously partitioned and occurred at different scales throughout orogenesis. Localization of deformation is an important control on garnet growth and repartitioning during successive deformation events resulted in a heterogeneous spatial distribution of garnet growth through time. The episodic nature of garnet growth is reflected in compositional zoning anomalies in garnet porphyroblasts from the Hoosac Formation. Zones of manganese enrichment, accompanied by calcium depletion, reveal pauses in garnet growth that may have been accompanied by fluid infiltration, garnet dissolution-reprecipitation and metasomatism at crystal or greater scales. The metamorphic history of these samples was further investigated using P-T pseudosections constructed via THERMOCALC. The mineral assemblages predicted are in good agreement with the observed mineralogy of the samples and estimates of P-T conditions at the time of garnet core growth were made using compositional isopleths based on microprobe analyses of garnet core composition. The samples do not show a clear relationship between the P-T data and the FIA data, suggesting that the preservation of different FIAs is not simply a function of P-T conditions. In samples where initial garnet appears to have occurred at temperature and/or pressure conditions higher than the minimum P-T conditions predicted for garnet stability, deformation probably played an essential role in garnet nucleation and growth. These &#8220;overstepped&#8221; samples indicate a progressive increase in pressure through the different phases of orogenesis. This study reveals that garnet porphyroblasts in southern Vermont and northwestern Massachusetts grew during a complex history of deformation involving the production of multiple sub-horizontal and sub-vertical foliations with garnet growth primarily controlled by deformation partitioning, resulting in a heterogeneous spatial distribution through time. FIAs allow the relative age of different phases of garnet growth to be established and provide a framework for interpreting the relationship between deformation and metamorphism. Compositional zoning anomalies reflect the episodic nature of garnet growth and P-T modelling suggests that deformation took place under conditions of increasing pressure.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1377/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1377/2/02sectionsA-Dtext.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1377/3/03sectionsA-Bfiguresandtables.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1377/4/04sectionCfiguresandtables.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1377/5/05sectionDfiguresandtables.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1377/6/06appendices.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of the influence of organisational culture on the service predispositions of hospitality workers in tropical North Queensland</field><field name="creator">Pryce, Josephine</field><field name="description">The past decade has witnessed a continued emphasis on services and the delivery of quality service. More recently, increasing attention has been focused on the hospitality industry as it has become more widely recognized as an important sector of the service economy. The hospitality industry, like other service industries, is a people-oriented industry. The importance of satisfying customers and its association with quality is well established. Customers&#8217; perceptions of the level of quality within the service transaction are dependent on the attitudes and behaviours of service providers. Traditionally hospitality workers are expected to exhibit positive attitudes toward the customer. In the author&#8217;s experience this is not always the case. It seems that attitudes alone are not responsible for delivery of quality service. Hospitality workers are seemingly influenced by an overarching industry culture. This study sets out to explore the service predispositions of hospitality workers and examines the relationship between the attitudes of hospitality workers and organizational culture. In an attempt to examine the influence of the organizational culture on the service predispositions of hospitality workers, data was gathered from six four-star hotels in Tropical North Queensland, Australia. Research into the key components of service predispositions is emergent and while there is a plethora of research into organizational culture, there are no studies that have investigated the relationship between organizational culture and employees&#8217; service predispositions. First, profiles of service predispositions were developed. Second, the nature and characteristics of organizational culture were examined. Third, the relationship between service predispositions and organizational culture was investigated. The Service Predispositions Instrument (SPI) was used amongst a sample of 254 hotel employees to assess their attitudes toward providing quality service. Initially, the data was analysed and used to validate the dimensionality of the questionnaire. Thereafter, the &#8216;service attitudes&#8217; of hospitality workers were collated to develop hospitality SPI norms. The results showed that some dimensions were considered to be more important by hotel employees for delivering quality service. The greatest value was given to the dimensions of communication, competence and individual consideration. This suggests that hospitality workers recognize the importance of communicating clearly, openly and with enthusiasm with customers, of being confident in the command of skills and knowledge necessary to perform the job and of accepting that all customers are different and so, have a willingness to consider that their needs on an exclusive basis are necessary. These three dimensions could then be considered as &#8216;industry norms&#8217; for the delivery of exceptional service. Organisational culture was measured using an instrument that consisted of 96 seven-point Likert-type statements. This instrument represented a set of questions that were developed from issues important to hotel workers and the literature. Once the reliability and validity of the instrument were tested, the data was analysed using a range of analytical procedures, including correlations, ANOVAs and multiple regressions, to develop a profile of the organisational culture in hotels and to establish the relationship between organisational culture and employees&#8217; service predispositions. Principal components analysis (PCA) produced 28 underlying dimensions of organisational culture. The findings showed that importance of job, customer orientation, rituals, training and role ambiguity were seen as the most important components of hotel culture. More importantly, the relationship between organizational culture and service predispositions was confirmed and the notion of the existence of an overarching occupational hospitality culture emerged. It is proposed that employees of the hotel industry, as an occupational identity, generate an occupational hospitality culture where hospitality workers share some commonalities about the nature of being hospitable and service delivery, regardless of the hotel or firm they work for. This culture is a powerful, ubiquitous influence, which may override organisational hospitality culture and drive the behaviour and performance of hospitality workers.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1379/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1379/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology of invasions of non-indigenous freshwater fishes in northern Queensland</field><field name="creator">Webb, Alan Charles</field><field name="description">This study investigated the ecology of invasions of non-indigenous freshwater fishes in northern Queensland and, in particular, examination of historical changes in their distribution patterns and establishment success in relation to their use of human altered habitats and interactions with indigenous predators and parasites. Seventeen non-indigenous fish species were reported from northern Queensland fresh waters during the study with eleven species establishing breeding populations. Virtually all species were observed in waterways in agricultural and urban regions that have been altered by human activity. Non-indigenous fishes are continuing to disperse locally, with large-scale changes in range due to translocation by humans. Previous history of introductions elsewhere and indices of propagule pressure (frequency of introductions) and habitat matching (absolute latitudinal range overlap) are very good, though not absolute, predictors of establishment success of non-indigenous fishes in northern Queensland. Field and laboratory studies demonstrated the importance of refuges, created by habitat disturbance, to the survivorship of some small, non-indigenous species. In the Ross River catchment, non-indigenous fishes were predominant in small streams and channels where access was blocked by dense aquatic vegetation and in isolated wetlands, but virtually absent from open water sites in the main channel of the Ross River and Ross Dam. Species diversity and abundances of indigenous fishes, however, were significantly less than for main channel sites. There was a strong association between mass stocking of the predatory Barramundi, Lates calcarifer, and a significant reduction in catches between the pre-stocking (1991/92) and poststocking (1997/98) periods, particularly of the indigenous Bony bream, Nematolosa erebi. Catches of the non-indigenous Mozambique mouthbrooder, Oreochromis mossambicus, were not affected. Piscivorous fish, including Barramundi and Mouth almighty, Glossamia aprion, apparently did not target non-indigenous fishes, even though the Mozambique mouthbrooder is a dominant component of the fish community in the weirs. Juvenile and subadult Mozambique mouthbrooder remained in refuge habitats inaccessible to large predators until they were large enough to join adult schools in more open water. At this stage, these fish are effectively too large (deep-bodied) and spinous to be selected as prey, even by large, gape-limited predators such as Barramundi. Experimental studies showed that piscivorous fishes, irrespective of foraging mode, were functional rather than taxonomic predators: they will eat non-indigenous fishes if available. In the absence of cover, predators chose slow, soft-finned and narrow-bodied fish as prey in preference to fast, evasive, deep-bodied fish with spines. Non-indigenous fishes had depauperate, stochastically-determined parasite communities dominated by non-indigenous parasites introduced with the host. Non-indigenous fishes had significantly lower parasite species richness, intensity and prevalence and more aggregated parasite frequency distributions than indigenous fishes, particularly in high disturbance habitats. It is argued that these differences assist the invasion and establishment of non-indigenous fishes by reducing adverse affects of parasites on host fitness. There was a significant positive correlation between parasite acquisition and residence time for non-indigenous fishes. Parasite acquisition appears to be a very slow process and may occur over centuries &#8211; even millennia - rather than decades. This slow acquisition will also benefit non-indigenous fishes as it allows them a long period of adjustment to the new environment relatively free from parasites. Management options for non-indigenous fishes in northern Queensland are discussed. It is argued that habitat restoration can play a key role in the long term management of non-indigenous fish species by increased exposure to predation and competition (biotic resistance) and so greatly reduce local populations of non-indigenous fishes and increase the probability of their extinction.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1399/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1399/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The structural and hydrothermal evolution of intrusion-related gold mineralisation at the Brewery Creek Mine, Yukon, Canada</field><field name="creator">Lindsay, Mark J.</field><field name="description">Vein, fracture and disseminated Au-As-Sb mineralisation at Brewery Creek is principally hosted by Tombstone Plutonic Suite (TPS) monzonite sills that have intruded Palaeozoic sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the Selwyn Basin and the Earn Group. The overall architecture of the property is that of a broad NNE trending arch of thrust sheets, with the rocks in each thrust sheet deformed into upright to steeply inclined, open to tight, variably NE, E, NW trending and plunging folds. Middle Cretaceous intrusive rocks including monzonite, syenite and hornblende gabbro cut the thrust faults and folds. The monzonite intrusive rocks crop out through the centre of the Brewery Creek property as a series of elongate, E oriented sills that have been subsequently deformed by numerous, variably oriented normal faults The paragenetic history of Brewery Creek can be resolved into three main stages: pre-, syn- and post- TPS intrusion. The pre-TPS intrusion stage encompasses sedimentary rock hosted disseminated and massive pyrite, carbonate veins and breccia infill, quartz veins, and stylolites. The TPS intrusion stage comprises the emplacement of TPS intrusions and the development of their contact aureoles and the post-TPS intrusion includes pyrite &#177; quartz &#177; carbonate &#177; roscoelite veins, quartz only veins, gold bearing arsenopyrite-quartz-carbonate veins, several stages of brecciation and stibnite &#177; quartz &#177; carbonate &#177; kaolinite veins. Gold assay analysis and vein measurements from the open pits along the Reserve Trend highlight two distinct mineralised orientations, E and NE. These orientations are paralleled by numerous metre-scale, steeply dipping post-TPS faults and mineralisation is bound at depth by a moderately dipping, E-striking normal fault, termed the Basal Fault. The observed normal displacement, which is evident on all of the post-TPS faults, combined with steeply dipping E-trending gold bearing veins is best explained by mineralisation occurring during a period of local extension. Gold mineralisation at Brewery Creek is characterised by an Au-As-Sb &#177; Ag, Pb geochemical signature with elevated As (&gt; 1000 ppm) being the best indicator of Au &gt; 1 ppm. High concentrations of Sb in intrusive rocks and elevated levels of Ag and Sb in sedimentary rocks provide further indication of Au. Alteration is characterised by enrichment of CO2, K2O, MnO, and SO3 and depletion of Na2O. This element mobility can be directly correlated to pervasive carbonate, pyrite and arsenopyrite alteration of feldspar and biotite in monzonite sills. CaO and Fe2O3 are comparatively immobile, which suggests that the Ca and Fe required to form calcite and pyrite respectively was sourced from destruction of feldspars and biotite. The highest Au concentrations at Brewery Creek are hosted by arsenopyrite crystals with lower but significant levels of Au also found in arsenopyrite overgrowths on pyrite and pyrite overgrown by arsenopyrite. Gold is preferentially distributed into arsenopyrite and pyrite phases hosted by carbonate and clay altered wall rock. Veinhosted sulphide minerals are volumetrically minor and contain lower concentrations of gold. Hydrothermal fluids associated with mineralisation were reduced, CO2 rich and near neutral in pH. Gold was likely to have been transported as a bisulphide complex and the predominance of Au-bearing wall rock arsenopyrite and arsenian pyrite emphasise the importance of sulphidation reactions as a Au precipitation mechanism. Isotope data provide evidence for significant input of magmatic fluids into the mineralising system at Brewery Creek. The calculated fluid compositions are consistent with an initial mixed magmatic and crustal (sedimentary) source that is replaced over time by a mixed magmatic and evolved meteoric fluid source. A genetic model for mineralisation is described that is based on emplacement of felsic magma and subsequent cooling of the associated hydrothermal system.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1410/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1410/2/02whole.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1410/5/03Maps_1-2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1410/6/Appendix_1_-_JCU_catalogue_numbers.xls</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1410/7/Appendix_2_-_Analytical_methodology.doc</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1410/8/Appendix_3_-_Intrusion_geochemistry.xls</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1410/9/Appendix_4_-_Microprobe_data.xls</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1410/10/Appendix_5_-_Viceroy_exploration_fire_assay.xls</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1410/11/Appendix_6_-_Drill_hole_and_trench_collar_location.xls</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1410/12/Appendix_7_-_Blasthole_assays.xls</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1410/13/Appendix_8_-_Viceroy_lithology_and_lith_codes.xls</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1410/14/Appendix_9_-_Viceroy_ICP_data.xls</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1410/15/Appendix_10_-_Descriptive_statistics.xls</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1410/16/Appendix_11_-_Correlation_matricies_for_Viceroy_multi-elemen.xls</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1410/17/Appendix_12_-_Factor_scores.xls</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1410/18/Appendix_13_-_Factor_analysis_by_major_rock_type.xls</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1410/19/Appendix_14_-_Factor_analysis_by_mineralised_zone.xls</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1410/20/Appendix_15_-_LA-ICP-MS_data.xls</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Townsville Common : codifying a private view of natural energies</field><field name="creator">Nixon-Smith, Patricia Joan</field><field name="description">Humans have been interacting with the Townsville Town Common Environmental Park throughout its history. This study probes the relationship between artist and The Common. More specifically, it examines this artist&#8217;s response to energies of cyclical change within the Common (growth cycle, diurnal change, seasonal change, migratory patterns and motion of tides). An account is given of the previous one hundred and thirty year history of The Common to provide a background to the artist&#8217;s interest in, and use of, the park. A scientific view of The Common is also provided to give a context to the research explorations. Particularly useful in this regard is information on the evolution and uniqueness of this park obtained by extensive consultations with wetlands ecologist J.G. Blackman, an authority on The Common. To set a visual arts context for the practical component of the study, artists using a range of mediums and featuring The Common as subject, are examined: John Olsen (gouache paintings), Jim Cox (pen and ink drawings), James Brown (oil paintings) and Hilary Mangan (lithography prints). This examination reveals the essence of each artist&#8217;s relationship with The Common. In revealing the response of the artist to energies of cyclical change on The Common, the thesis lays out the development of an idiosyncratic visual code to express the energies of cyclical change experienced during 2002. By design, this code integrates intuitive and analytical processes framed by these experiences. Predicated on personal observations and responses to natural energy cycles (Growth, Diurnal, Seasonal, Migratory and Tidal) experienced at five different sites during weekly field trips spanning a twelve-month period, intuition and analysis drive the research. From studies made during these field trips, involving diaries of drawings, field notes, forty etchings and extensive photographic records, a framework of intuitive responses (gut reactions) to, and ideas about, natural energies is established. This framework is pivotal to the development of the code by allowing changes in personal response to energy cycles to be identified. Construction of the code involves three stages. First, there is analysis of the intuitive responses involving examination of twenty field-trip etchings and supporting diary notes. Second, is extension of key features from these intuitively drawn etchings, by transposing pivotal sections from the prints into twenty exploratory study paintings. These studies determine visual devices for the code by focusing on separate design elements (line, shape, tone and texture). Third, is the application of these devices as a code in five paintings to convey the notion of energies experienced. By intention, the application of the code in these final paintings should show the expression of the artist&#8217;s responses to the energies of cyclical change. Evaluation concerning aptness of the code for capturing expression of these energies is from the viewpoint of the artist in the context of comparison between a pre-research control painting and the five post-research paintings. This comparison shows that the code integrates intuitive response and analytical thinking to convey the notion of cyclical change regarding The Common. Analysis reveals that this code also has potential for application to a much wider range of landscapes. Moreover, the three stages of its development may be a useful approach for other artists to encode their vision. The outcome of the research is presented by an exhibition of sixty-eight artworks tracing the development of the idiosyncratic visual code from driver of gut reactions in response to singular experiences, to encompassing views of energies of five cyclical changes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1414/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1414/2/02chapters1-3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1414/3/03chapter4parts1-2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1414/4/04chapter4parts3-4.4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1414/5/05chapter4parts4.5.1-4.5.3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1414/6/06chapter4parts4.5.4-4.5.5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1414/7/07chapter4parts4.5.6-4.6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1414/8/08chapter5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1414/9/09chapters6-7.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1414/10/10bibliography.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1414/11/11appendices.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trace elements in coal from Colinsville, Bowen basin, Australia : in-ground mode of occurrence and behaviour during utilisation</field><field name="creator">Boyd, Robert John</field><field name="description">Analysis of samples gathered during delineation of a coal resource is becoming increasingly sophisticated as various organisations attempt to predict and understand the technological behaviour of the mined product. Analysis to determine the concentration of trace elements in coal is becoming more prevalent, and not just merely for academic curiosity. Increased environmental awareness has impelled the need to consider potential negative impacts on the ecosystem caused by liberation of trace elements from coal during utilisation. The aims of this thesis are to: 1) Determine the concentration of trace elements in coal seams mined to supply the Collinsville pulverised fuel combustion plant at the Collinsville open cut, Northern Bowen Basin, Australia; 2) Determine the mineralogy and, using graphical relationships, the likely mode of occurrence of trace elements in the sampled pits; 3) Determine the mode of occurrence of trace elements in the pulverised fuel of the Collinsville power plant using the USGS sequential leaching method, and contrast the results with the same analysis for an unrelated fuel from another coal fired power utility (Mitsui Mining&#8217;s Omutu City plant, Kyushu, Japan); 4) Examine the partitioning behaviour of trace elements in the Collinsville power utility, and contrast the results with the partitioning behaviour of trace elements in the Mitsui combustion utility to assess the influence of trace element mode of occurrence on partitioning behaviour; 5) Examine the mobility of trace elements from solid ash waste from the Collinsville power utility, and compare with the mobility of trace elements from the Mitsui power utility solid waste to assess the influence of mode of occurrence on the leachability of trace elements and; 6) Determine the partitioning behaviour of trace elements in carbonisation of Bowen seam coal at the Bowen coke works and compare with the partitioning behaviour of the same elements in combustion. Lithotype logging of coal exposed in the highwalls of the Blake Central, Blake West and Bowen No.2 pits was undertaken. Of particular note was the presence of dull heat affected coal toward the roof of the Blake Central pit seam, toward the floor of the Bowen No.2 pit seam, and the presence of bed-parallel intrusions within the seam in the Blake West pit. In the Blake West pit seam, the intrusion caused thermal alteration of the coal to coke over a 60cm zone immediately adjacent to the intrusion with a further 1.10- 1.25m zone of dull heat altered coal beyond the coked zone. In the Blake Central, 4.5m of dull heat-affected coal occurred near the roof of the seam. In the Bowen No.2 pit, 1.2m of heat-affected coal occurred near the floor of the seam. Beyond the heat affected zone, lithotype logging of the Blake seams noted a number of rock partings, but no convincing dulling upward cycles due to progressive drying of the mire, noted in other studies of Permian coal, were found. No partings were found in the Bowen seam and only one convincing dulling upward cycles was logged. In part the absence of dulling upward cycles is due to heat alteration of the coal, but the numerous influxes of sediment laden water into the Blake seam mire also acted to terminate any significant dulling upward cycles by raising both nutrient levels and the water table. Following lithotype logging, channel sampling of the pits resulted in a total of 76 samples, 25 from the Blake Central pit, 36 from the Blake West pit and 15 from the Bowen No.2 pit. The channel sampling intervals were determined approximately by coal lithotype interval, with some amalgamations to restrict sample numbers. The channel samples were analysed for proximate analysis, coal petrography and vitrinite reflectance (selected samples) and for major and trace elements using XRF and INAA. The lithotype logs, proximate analysis data and coal petrography were integrated to infer the depositional environment of the Blake and Bowen seams. The generally high ash yield, common stone bands, low sulphur content of the coal and rare pyrite in the Blake seam suggests the depositional environment was a Class 3 topotelmitic peat with a variable water table. The moderate ash yield, the absence of common stone bands, sulphur contents of ~2% and the moderate pyrite content of the coal in the Bowen seam suggests the depositional environment was a Class 2 topotelmitic peat with a high water table. The igneous intrusions have caused extensive alteration of vitrinite to semi-coke, a general decrease in the volatile matter content and an increase in the vitrinite reflectance [Ro(max)] toward the intrusion. Mineralogy was calculated from major and trace elements using normative analysis, calibrated by XRD analysis of low temperature ash from selected samples. The mineralogy of the Blake seam samples is dominated by kaolinite, with subordinate quartz, illite, feldspar, and siderite, and minor concentrations of pyrite, gorceixite, goyazite and anatase. The mineralogy of the Bowen seam samples is dominated by kaolinite, with subordinate quartz, illite and pyrite, and minor concentrations of siderite, gorceixite, goyazite and anatase/ rutile/ iron oxides. The concentration of trace elements in the channel samples was determined by INAA and XRF. The INAA and XRF concentrations of iron and uranium show a reasonable statistical relationship suggesting the two analysis methods are consistent with each other. The concentration of trace elements in the Blake and Bowen seams is generally low compared to world average ranges for coal and to crustal averages. Only gold, copper, hafnium, thorium and ytterbium were found to be above the world coal average range in the Blake seam. Only gold and copper were found to be above world coal average range in the Bowen seam coal. Trace element mode of occurrence was inferred using graphical relationships between normative mineral and trace element concentrations. In the Blake seam, arsenic, possibly chromium, copper, mercury, nickel and lead were inferred to be associated with pyrite. Bromine, cobalt, selenium, and zinc appeared to be organically bound. Cerium, caesium, europium, lanthanum, rubidium, and scandium showed a graphical relationship with illite. However, cerium, europium, lanthanum and scandium, along with hafnium, lutetium, neodymium, samarium, terbium, thorium, uranium and vanadium also showed a graphical relationship with gorceixite or gorceixite plus goyazite. It was inferred the latter group of elements are associated with monazite or zircon. In addition to the REE phosphate mode of occurrence, some rare earth elements also showed an affinity for kaolinite. Thorium and uranium were also inferred to be associated with feldspars. Antimony, tantalum and ytterbium were found to be dominantly associated with kaolinite. In the Bowen seam, arsenic, cobalt, possibly chromium, copper, mercury, molybdenum, nickel, lead, antimony, selenium and zinc showed a graphical relationship with pyrite. The elements cerium, hafnium, neodymium, rubidium, samarium, tantalum, thorium, uranium and tungsten all showed significant graphical relationships with the anatase/ rutile/ FeO grouping of minerals. It is inferred that the relationship is due to the presence of monazite, zircon, xenotime, REE phosphates, tungstates or other trace minerals, the distribution of which mirrors the distribution of the anatase/ rutile/ FeO grouping. Uranium and thorium were inferred to be associated with REE phosphates and zircon respectively, plus illite. The elements bromine, europium, lanthanum, terbium and vanadium were inferred to be associated with illite. A mixed illite/ heavy mineral suite mode of occurrence is inferred for samarium, tantalum, thorium and uranium. The elements caesium, lutetium, scandium, and ytterbium were inferred to be associated with kaolinite. The effect of igneous intrusions on the concentration of a number of minerals and trace elements was also examined. The presence of semi-coke or an inferred distance of heat alteration was used to distinguish heat affected and unaffected samples. Depletion or enrichment of minerals and elements was inferred using ply thickness weighted average concentration figures for altered and unaltered samples and trends of concentration change toward the intrusion. Some consistent changes in the concentration of trace elements and minerals were found across all three pits sampled. The minerals siderite and pyrite are depleted in the heat affected zone, but goyazite is enriched, particularly toward the margins of the heat affected zone. The elements bromine and strontium (the latter mirroring the goyazite trend) are concentrated in the heat affected zone. The elements cobalt, mercury, manganese (mirroring the pyrite trend), nickel and possibly arsenic and zinc are depleted in heat affected samples from all three pits sampled. The inconsistent behaviour of some other trace elements (molybdenum, chromium and possibly selenium) in response to the igneous intrusion appears to be the result of different modes of occurrence of trace elements between pits. Samples of pulverised fuel were collected from the Collinsville and Japanese (Mitsui) pulverised fuel utilities. The concentration of major and trace elements was determined by INAA, XRF and (for the Collinsville sample) ICP-MS &amp; ICP-AES. INAA analysis suggests gold, cerium, cobalt, europium, hafnium, lanthanum, lutetium, molybdenum, neodymium, scandium, selenium, samarium, strontium, tantalum, thorium, tungsten and ytterbium are at the upper end or above the world average concentration range in the Collinsville pulverized fuel. Only gold, hafnium and thorium are at the upper end or above the world coal concentration range in the Japanese pulverized fuel. Sequential leaching of the pulverised fuels was undertaken according to the USGS protocol. The sequential leach data was interpreted to infer trace element mode of occurrence in the pulverised fuel. A number of significant differences in the mode of occurrence of antimony, arsenic, chromium, cobalt, nickel, selenium, uranium and zinc were found between the two combustion plants studied. The element vanadium had almost identical modes of occurrence in fuel from both plants studied. A comparison of trace element mode of occurrence determined for the Collinsville power utility pulverised fuel by sequential leaching with mode of occurrence determined for the in-ground feed coals using graphical methods showed a reasonable level of agreement. It is concluded that the use of two methods of determining mode of occurrence provides better definition of mineral type in some cases. For example a siderite mode of occurrence could be determined using graphical relationship whereas the sequential leach data gave only a carbonate mode of occurrence. Further, the sequential leach data solved the problem of parallel graphical relationships. For example, galena was determined to be the mode of occurrence of lead from the sequential leach data, whereas graphical relationships indicated a pyrite mode of occurrence because of the relationship with sulphur. Combustion of coal occurs in three phases, namely devolatilisation, combustion of the volatile matter, and combustion of the residual char. Mineral matter may be excluded from the residual char particles due to desegregation and separation in the milling process, or included within the char particle. During combustion, trace elements partition between the bottom ash, the fly ash, and flue gas (lost up the stack). The concentration of trace elements in ash samples from the Collinsville and Mitsui power utilities was determined by INAA and XRF. The partitioning behaviour of the trace elements is examined by calculating relative enrichment values for the trace elements. Generally the partitioning behaviour and classification of trace elements in this study matched those found in previous published studies for a given element. The relative enrichment trends of elements exhibiting significant differences in mode of occurrence between the two combustion plants sampled (ie antimony, arsenic, chromium, cobalt, nickel, selenium, uranium and zinc plus vanadium) were examined to determine the control of mode of occurrence on the partitioning behaviour. It is hypothesised that the relative volatility of a particular element in combustion reflects the temperature at which the host mineral or the organic matter thermally decomposes. Thus organically bound elements should be more volatile than pyrite associated elements, which should be more volatile than carbonate associated elements, which should be substantially more volatile than silicate associated elements. Other factors that may influence partitioning behaviour such as the major element chemistry of the ash, plant design and operating conditions, and temperature variations within the combustion chamber were discounted as significantly influencing relative enrichment differences for the two combustion plants studied. It is concluded that element mode of occurrence has a strong influence on the relative volatility of a given element, and that comparison of sequential leach results from two pulverised fuel utilities has the potential allow prediction of the relative volatility of trace elements in combustion. Some complications may arise due to exclusion of some mineral grains and localised variations in the oxidation state within the combustion zone. Solid combustion wastes (fly ash and bottom ash) are commonly disposed of in landfill and impoundment facilities. Unless the landfill is impermeable to water, disposal of solid wastes in such fashion allows interaction with the hydrogeological system and could lead to detrimental environmental impacts. Leaching of indicative &#8220;total waste&#8221; composites made up by blending fly ash and bottom ash samples from each power utility in an 80/20 proportion was undertaken using the TCLP protocol. The concentration of trace elements in the leachates was compared to recreational water and drinkwater guideline values. The concentration of barium, manganese, and selenium in the Collinsville leachate exceeds both the recreational and drinkwater guideline concentrations. The concentration of nickel in the Collinsville leachate was found to exceed the recommended drinkwater concentration, but is below recreational water guideline value. The concentration of boron and selenium in the Mitsui leachate was found to exceed both the recreational and drinkwater guideline values. The concentration of barium in the Mitsui leachate was found to exceed the drinkwater standard. The concentration of an element in the ash sample was found to be a poor indicator of the mobility of the element. Elements that showed substantial differences in mode of occurrence in the pulverised fuel (ie antimony, arsenic, chromium, cobalt, nickel, selenium, uranium and zinc plus vanadium) were examined to assess the influence of mode of occurrence on the leachability of the element from solid combustion waste. It is concluded that, where the difference in element mobility between the two composite ash samples is significant, mode of occurrence does exert some control on the proportion of a trace element in the ash that can be mobilised by the TCLP protocol. In particular, trace elements present in coal associated with silicates appear substantially unavailable for mobilisation by the TCLP protocol. The concentration of trace elements in samples of feed coal, coke and breeze from the Bowen coke works was determined by INAA and XRF. A new index (the CRE index) was developed to characterise the enrichment or depletion of trace elements in the coke and breeze. Coke is classified as enriched (Class 1), neither enriched nor depleted (Class 2), depleted (Class 3) or highly depleted (Class 4). Breeze was classified as enriched (denoted &#8220;e&#8221;), neither enriched nor depleted (denoted &#8220;a&#8221;) and depleted (denoted &#8220;d&#8221;). Comparison of the partitioning behaviour of trace elements in combustion and carbonisation was undertaken by comparing the RE and CRE data. It is concluded that all but the most volatile elements (sulphur, selenium, arsenic and tungsten) are substantially retained in the coke. The substantial retention of trace elements in coke is likely due to the lower temperature at which carbonisation occurs compared to pulverised fuel combustion temperatures. The behaviour of trace elements in the breeze is similar to their behaviour in combustion, being controlled by mode of occurrence end element volatility. Trace elements associated with pyrite are generally enriched in the breeze, excepting highly volatile elements such as sulphur, selenium and arsenic, which appear to substantially volatilise. Silicate associated elements and those elements associated with heavy minerals are also generally non-volatile excepting tungsten that is depleted in the coke and breeze. The concentration of trace elements in the pit channel samples and in the pulverised fuel sample suggest the elements barium, selenium, mercury, thorium, copper, manganese, nickel and vanadium warrant further investigation in Collinsville pit and combustion wastes. The data suggests the elements thorium, boron, selenium and barium warrant further investigation in the Japanese combustion plant. Further work to verify that relative differences in mode of occurrence inferred from USGS sequential leaching are useful as indicators of trace element volatility and leachability is recommended. The environmentally significant trace elements cobalt, molybdenum, antimony, strontium, zinc and possibly arsenic and chromium are enriched in the breeze samples from the Bowen coke works. Leaching studies to determine the proportion and concentration of trace elements in the leachate upon disposal of the waste is worth consideration. Further studies to characterise trace element partitioning during carbonisation in a slot oven are recommended.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1417/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1417/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interspecific hybridization in Acropora (Cnidaria: Scleractinia): mechanisms and evolutionary consequences</field><field name="creator">M&#225;rquez, Luis Miguel</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses several aspects of the genetics and reproductive biology of cross-fertile, mass-spawning scleractinian corals, specifically in the genus Acropora, and the results presented contribute to our understanding of the evolutionary consequences of hybridization in this animal group. The rDNA ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region has been used for phylogenetic analysis of cross-fertile coral species in the genus Acropora, and has shown patterns of variation consistent with reticulate evolution. However, results from a number of analyses in this thesis, including the occurrence of deamination-like substitutions at methylation sites; differences in evolutionary rates among clades of a 5.8S phylogeny; and ocurrence of non-compensatory mutations that may affect the rRNA secondary structure, suggest that at least part of rDNA diversity in Acropora is due to pseudogenes. Natural hybridization in coral genera may cause taxa to merge through homogenization of gene pools or may create new hybrid species. Here I demonstrate that high cross-fertilization in vitro does not guarantee the merging of species. Data from eight polymorphic allozyme loci indicate small but significant differentiation between sympatric populations of A. cytherea and A. hyacinthus, a pair of acroporid corals with very high interspecific fertilization rates in vitro. The biological significance of differences between the species in sympatry is highlighted by the absence of genetic differentiation between widely allopatric populations within each species. Moreover, a Nested Clade Analysis using sequence data from a nuclear intron indicates that these two species constitute distinct evolutionary lineages. I conclude that A. cytherea and A. hyacinthus are neither merging nor constitute morphs within a single species, but rather conform distinct cohesion species. Cross-fertilization trials may overestimate the rate of hybridization that occurs under natural conditions, because they are non-competitive, involving the exclusive combination of sperm from one species with eggs from another. I designed breeding trials using acroporid corals to test whether the mixture of conspecific and heterospecific sperm inhibits interspecific fertilization, promoting conspecific sperm precendence. However, spawning failure and low cross-fertilization rate between the study species did not allow evaluating this hypothesis properly. Integrins are proteins involved in cell adhesion that play major roles in gamete binding and fusion in mammals. A cDNA sequence encoding for a b1- class integrin has been identified in the scleractinian coral Acropora millepora. Given that the integrin mRNA is present in unfertilized eggs, the corresponding protein may have a potential role in coral fertilization. As a first attempt to elucidate the molecular basis of gamete specificity in corals, I studied the role of the Acropora millepora bCn1 integrin in fertilization. I examined the effect of polyclonal antiserum raised against a substantial part of the bCn1 integrin on fertilization rates of A. millepora eggs. The results indicate that Acropora bCn1 integrin is involved in sperm-egg binding but does not confer reproductive specificity. The implication of a disintegrin-integrin binding in the fertilization process in Acropora suggests that some functions of these molecules may have been conserved in corals and humans.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1555/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1555/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The structure, sedimentology, sequence stratigraphy and tectonics of the northern Drummond and Galilee Basins, Central Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Van Heeswijck, Aldo</field><field name="description">The Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous Drummond Basin and overlying Late Carboniferous-Middle Triassic Galilee Basin are extensive intracratonic basins with predominantly fluvial sediment infill. They are inferred to have developed on Proterozoic and Early Palaeozoic basement similar to the adjacent Charters Towers Province and Anakie Inlier. Depositional and structural architecture of the basins have been investigated through a combination of seismic, geophysical well log and gravity data sets with lithologic information obtain from well cores, surface mapping and sedimentary petrography. Comprehensive interpretation of 750 km of seismic traverse resulted in the recognition of eleven seismic facies, several of which have distinctive internal signatures, separated by reflection boundaries that can be traced basin wide. Lithologic and geophysical logs from sixteen wells and boreholes can be matched to seismic stratigraphic units and allow the basinal infill to be described in terms of the lithostratigraphic frameworks already established in the literature. The construction of structure contours for unit boundary surfaces has identified extensional structures associated with rift phases of basinal development and the pattern of thrust and thrust fold features associated with basin inversion. Eleven new structural features that have continuity through the Drummond and Galilee Basins have been defined and other features noted in the literature have been reinterpreted based on evidence from seismic profiles. The construction of isopachs for each unit has allowed tracking of basinal infill thickness trends through time. Analysis of geophysical and lithologic logs from petroleum wells and boreholes, augmented by sections documented from surface exposure has resulted in the recognition of some 16 discrete sequences, each based on a repeating pattern of three types of non-marine systems tract that mainly reflect basinal tectonics but also the influence of climate and eustatic sea level change. Both basins share a common style of sequence development that is not reflected in the current literature. Provenance interpretation based on petrographic data from 121 thin sections representative of most of the Drummond Basin and all of the Galilee Basin suggests that the majority of basin infill was derived from a recycled cratonic source, such as the Thomson Fold Bel to the west, and less material derived from an eastern volcanic arc than previously thought. However SHRIMP-derived U-Pb age data for zircon populations from two samples broadly representative of quartz arenites prominent in the basinal successions conflict with this view. Such data for a sample from the Mount Hall Formation of the Drummond Basin indicates that its source was largely from Early to Mid Palaeozoic igneous terranes like those represented in the Charters Towers Province to the north and inferred for the Thomson Fold Belt to the west. Zircon ages of a sample of Warang Sandstone of the Galilee Basin indicates a Late Palaeozoic igneous source, with derivation largely from an eastern magmatic arc. The Drummond Basin commenced as a back-arc extensional basin, progressed through a thermal sag phase and ceased development during mild compression associated with a far-field expression of the Kanimblan Orogeny. Structural patterns show initial rift architecture, with compartments separated by newly defined transfer fault zones. Extensional faults between the transfer structures extend further through the basinal succession than previously thought. This basin developed a broad sag phase but the final stages show a foreland influence induced by Kanimblan thrust loading on its eastern margin. Basinal structure has been strongly modified by inversion in the Middle Triassic associated with the Hunter-Bowen Orogeny. The Galilee Basin commenced as a foreland basin expressing continuity with the late-stage development of the underlying Drummond Basin from which its division is arbitrary and based on historical misconceptions of Kanimblan tectonism. Thermal subsidence related to the rift phase of the Drummond Basin continued as an influence in addition to foreland subsidence. Tectonic quiescence marks a mid-stage of basinal development reflected in a regionally developed paraconformity and deposition of a basinwide coal measure sequence related to eustatic sea level rise over a stable substrate. The upper part of Galilee Basin infill reflects a foreland phase of development and records two episodes of thrust loading on the eastern margin associated with the Hunter-Bowen Orogeny. Ongoing crustal contraction during the Hunter-Bowen Orogeny resulted in inversion of the Drummond and Galilee Basins with the development of large-scale thrust dislocations and associated fault bend anticlinal structures. The Middle Triassic Clematis Group is the youngest unit that shows folding due to inversion. Much of the western parts of both basins remain relatively undisturbed apart from gentle regional pre-Middle Jurassic tilting that marked the final phase of Hunter-Bowen tectonism.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1557/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1557/2/02chapters1-7.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1557/3/03figures_and_tables.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1557/4/04appendix1_Structure.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1557/5/05appendix2_Isopach.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1557/6/06appendix3_Faults.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1557/7/07appendix5_wells_and_measured_sections.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1557/8/08appendix6_pointcounts.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1557/9/09appendix7_PESA_symp_abstract.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Post-hatchling sea turtle biology</field><field name="creator">Boyle, Michelle C.</field><field name="description">The post-hatchling stage of a sea turtle&#8217;s life history has often been referred to as the &#8216;lost years&#8217;, reflecting the lack of understanding about this phase in their life. Obtaining information on where post-hatchlings go, or for how long, is significantly hindered by the elusiveness of a post-hatchling in its natural environment and the limitations of tagging technologies to track a hatchling as it leaves its nest. Consequently, much of what is understood of the post-hatchling life stage has been derived from indirect methods. As a result, our current understanding of post-hatchling biology is based on information gathered from stranded animals, opportunistic reports of sightings at sea, studies of hatchling behaviour, and more recently genetic based studies. Although knowledge on the post-hatchling stage has progressed considerably in the last few years, studies have been limited primarily to loggerhead turtles in the northern Atlantic Ocean and northern Pacific Ocean. Thus there are substantial gaps in our knowledge of the life history of sea turtles for many regions of the world. The aim of this study is to increase the understanding of the ecology of loggerhead and green post-hatchling sea turtles in the southwest Pacific Ocean. The information acquired on the post-hatchling phase of sea turtle life history will help direct future regional management of these animals by providing region-specific information on the migratory routes and habitats occupied during the posthatchling stage. This study also informs our global understanding of the sea turtle posthatchling biology. This study employed a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating ecological information from spatial and temporal distributions, diet and stable isotopes, and genetic methodologies. Post-hatchlings were sourced from strandings and from the stomachs of dolphin fish (Coryphaena hippurus). In addition, records were collated from the Queensland Environmental Protection Agency&#8217;s database of marine wildlife strandings and deaths. Data on the spatial and temporal distribution of post-hatchlings in relation to rookery location and oceanographic features compiled in this study provides evidence that loggerhead and green post-hatchlings from populations in the southwest Pacific region become entrained in oceanic currents and live a pelagic existence. Occupancy of an oceanic and pelagic habitat is supported by stable isotope signatures. In addition dietary investigations that show post-hatchlings in the southwest Pacific Ocean, from both of the investigated species, derive nutritional sustenance primarily from neustonic animal matter. The spatial and temporal data on the two species of post-hatchlings however, indicates that the two species do not take the same migratory route after departing from the same coastal waters. The data provides strong evidence that loggerhead post-hatchling undergo trans-Pacific migrations within the southern Pacific sub-tropical gyre. This is suggested by; (i) incremental post-hatchling size increase in direction of this current away from nesting beaches, (ii) reports of loggerhead post-hatchlings are in New Zealand waters and on the eastern side of the southern Pacific, and (iii) loggerhead post-hatchlings larger than 13.7 cm CCL are not documented in the southwest Pacific Ocean. Although the current resolution of the genetic stocks in the southern Pacific does not allow differentiation between stocks on a regional scale, there is discrimination at the oceanic scale. Analysis of the haplotypes of the loggerhead post-hatchlings shows that all specimens investigated in this study originated from southwest Pacific rookeries. Whereas the data implies that loggerhead post-hatchlings embark on trans-Pacific migrations, it suggests that green post-hatchlings do not. Whilst this species also occupies offshore oceanic waters, it appears they remain in the southwest Pacific region. This is indicated by; (i) green post-hatchlings occupying waters around offshore seamounts (whereas loggerhead post-hatchlings appear absent), (ii) the absence of green post-hatchlings in New Zealand or southeast Pacific waters, and (iii) the occurrence of larger size classes of green post-hatchlings stranded on eastern Australian coast. Mixed stock analysis (using SPAM &amp; TURTLE) performed with haplotypic information from post-hatchlings calculated that green post-hatchlings originate from the SGBR (60%), Coral Sea (27%) and New Caledonia (13%) rookeries. This study is the first to describe the route that loggerhead and green post-hatchlings from the Australian region are taking. I demonstrate that these two species are undertaking significantly different migrations during this stage of their life. The principal findings of this study support the currently accepted view on the sea turtle&#8217;s post-hatchling stage, for most species, is that of a pelagic oceanic existence.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1558/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1558/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The trophic ecology of the freshwater fishes of an Australian rainforest river</field><field name="creator">Rayner, Thomas S.</field><field name="description">In tropical rivers, seasonal cycles of flooding and drying have a major influence on the dynamics of biotic communities. Several global paradigms have been developed which attempt to account for the relationships between river flow, primary productivity, instream habitats, invertebrate and fish communities, fish feeding and food web structure. However, information from Australia is limited, particularly for rivers in the Wet Tropics region of north Queensland, which feature unique hydrogeomorphological characteristics and diverse freshwater fish assemblages. This thesis tests the applicability of global paradigms of riverine ecology to the Mulgrave River, a typical Wet Tropics system. Four lowland, main-channel sites were sampled on five occasions under a range of flow conditions, from dry season base flows to a one-in-ten year wet season flood. At each site, water quality and habitat data was collected, invertebrate communities in littoral and benthic habitats were sampled and fish were surveyed using a combination of boat electrofishing, gill netting and bait traps. This data was analysed using both univariate and multivariate statistical methods, before being collated into seasonal food web diagrams of the feeding links between fish and their food sources. Stable isotopes analysis was used to identify the most important pathways of energy transfer through these webs and a conceptual model of the factors affecting fish resource use and community structure was constructed. A total of 1530 fish were caught, representing 36 species. Longitudinal variation in fish community structure was identified, with species such as Melanotaenia splendida splendida and Tandanus tandanus abundant in upstream areas and Ambassis agrammus, Redigobius bikolanus and Lates calcarifer more common downstream. Some species, such as Nematalosa erebi, preferred open waters, while others were associated with particular microhabitat features (e.g., Notesthes robusta was generally found near root masses of riparian trees). During the dry season, the community was dominated by Gerres filamentosus, Neosilurus ater and the introduced Tilapia mariae, while during the wet season the community was dominated by Glossamia aprion and Nematalosa erebi. The fish fauna was classified into eight habitat guilds and seven feeding guilds. Most species preferred specific habitat features, such as root masses and instream vegetation, during the dry season, and then shifted to larger, deeper habitats with mud substrates and woody debris during the wet season. At this time, instream vegetation was removed from the main channel by high flow velocities and the scour of bed sediments, which reduced habitat heterogeneity. A range of foods were consumed by fish species, from detritus, algae and fruit, to aquatic invertebrates, molluscs and fish. While the availability of these foods tracked temporal changes in habitat, seasonal shifts in dietary composition were limited to two species and ontogenetic shifts were observed in just three species. Nonetheless, food consumption by the fish community as a whole reflected seasonal fluctuations in productivity and food supply: during the wet season, aerial and surface invertebrates, algae and some detritus appeared to be consumed more frequently, while macrophytes, microcrustaceans and molluscs appeared more important in the mean diet during the dry season. I hypothesise that fish were limited in their prey selection by their phylogeny and that they tracked changes in food availability by moving between habitat types, which resulted in the observed changes in fish assemblage structure. However, while the identity of fish species comprising the assemblage present in lowland reaches changed seasonally, food web structure did not change substantially, with many weak links and a few strong links at all times. Stable isotope analysis indicated that energy was transferred through these webs via algal and detrital pathways, with a greater diversity of productivity sources contributing to animal production during the wet season than during the dry season. In general, the dynamics of fish communities in the Mulgrave River are regulated by the unique hydrogeomorphological features of the catchment, which are typical of the Wet Tropics region. Specifically, upland streams in these systems are steep and main channels in lowland reaches are deeply incised relative to the surrounding floodplain. As a result, floodplain habitats in Wet Tropics catchments are poorly connected to the main channel, limiting their influence on primary productivity and their utility to freshwater fish species. While wet season flows are predictable, they act as disturbances in main-channel habitats, rather than the gentle flood &#8216;pulses&#8217; documented in other tropical areas. The results of this study emphasise the importance of flow seasonality in governing the spatial and temporal dynamics of productivity, instream habitat, invertebrate and fish populations, fish feeding and, therefore, the structure and function of aquatic food webs. Elements of several global models appear to apply under differing flow conditions, but no single model accounts for all of the dynamics observed in the lowland fish communities of the Mulgrave River. Given the inherent similarities of Wet Tropics catchments, the results of this study are widely applicable to other rivers across the region and provide support for the long-standing doctrine of the importance of maintaining natural flow regimes if freshwater fish diversity is to be conserved.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1561/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1561/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A remarkable venture of faith : an examination of the fiduciary relationship between the Anglican Church of Australia and the Missionary Diocese of Carpentaria</field><field name="creator">Hall-Matthews, Anthony</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1563/1/Extended_Abstract.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Holocene sand budget for the Seasonally Wet Tropics region of north Queensland</field><field name="creator">Dalla Pozza, Ramona</field><field name="description">The discharge of coastal streams between Bowen and Rollingstone, north Queensland is highly seasonal with ~90% of the total annual discharge typically occurring between December and April. This section of the Queensland coast is referred to as the Seasonally Wet Tropics. In this thesis the abbreviation SWT will be used to refer to the Seasonally Wet Tropics region and seasonally wet tropical systems. Most of the shorelines along this coast are dominated by sand. Previous literature suggests that seasonally wet tropics streams deliver large quantities of sand to the coast. However, little is known regarding the timeframes, pathways and dominant processes of sand delivery. A Holocene sand budget was developed for the SWT coastal zone from the studies of three SWT coastal systems: i) the Haughton River Estuary (Lat. -19.416, Long.147.126); ii) the Elliot River Estuary (Lat.-19.880, Long. 147.885) and iii) the Black River Delta (Lat. 146.651, Long. -19.178). These systems are typical examples of tropical, variable discharge rivers responding to the marked intra and inter-annual variability of the SWT weather and climate. This region is meso tidal and subject to relatively low-energy ambient wave conditions.  Conceptual models of the spatial and temporal patterns of coastal sand transfer for the Haughton and Elliot River Estuaries and the Black River Delta were developed based on historic, sedimentological, stratigraphic and hydrodynamic data. Three different sand transfer processes were observed in each system. The lack of coarse, poorly-sorted, angular sediments within the Haughton River Estuary suggests that the relative proportion of fluvial sediment supplied from the Haughton River is minor compared to the influx of marine sediment via tidal currents. Therefore, the Haughton River Estuary is tide-dominated and a sink for marine sediment. Relatively strong wave and tidal energy dominate sand transfer processes in the Elliot River Estuary, with little evidence to suggest that the Elliot River is contributing significant amounts of fluvial sand to the coast. In contrast, deposits of coarse poorly sorted sediments identified at the mouth of the Black River Delta suggested that the modern Black River exports some fluvial sand to coast, which is transported northwards by relatively strong wave energy and wave generated currents.  To interpret these findings within an evolutionary context, current estimates of fluvial sand delivery reported in the literature were extrapolated over the last 7 ka and compared with Holocene sand stored in onshore coastal deposits, nearshore and on the inner shelf. The results of the Holocene sand budget suggest an apparent deficit of ~6.5 &#215; 108 m3 of sand (including loss to the system via longshore drift) suggesting that seasonally wet tropics streams have not been delivering predicted volumes of sand to the coast for at least the last 1.6 ka. It is concluded that the sand derived landforms that dominate the seasonally wet tropics coast are the result of multicyclic processes &#8211; initiated by the landward movement of marine sand during the Holocene transgression.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1570/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1570/2/02chapters1-5_.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1570/3/03chapters6-8.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1570/4/04references.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1570/5/05appendices.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Charters Towers</field><field name="creator">Menghetti, Diane</field><field name="description">The academic establishment has probably not been waiting anxiously for a Ph.D. thesis on Charters Towers. Nevertheless there are several good reasons why one should have been written. .Firstly, the town played an important part in attracting settlers to North Queensland and in determining what sort of people these settlers would be. Secondly, the field made useful contributions to the technology and capitalisation of Australian mining at a time when the industry was growing rapidly. Thirdly political developments on Charters Towers influenced the style of Colonial politics, particularly labour politics, in a formative period. Lastly, there is an intrinsic historical interest in charting the growth of a community founded in the wilderness at the peak of the industrial-capitalist era.

The main objectives of the research were, firstly; to determine if there is a relationship between the degree of GAV infection and the production of P. monodon from the examined farms. Secondly, to develop low cost detection methods for GAV and by inference, yellow head virus (YHV) which are applicable to the prawn farming industry in both Australia and developing countries.  The first objective was achieved by sampling a total of forty five prawn ponds from three prawn farms at both one month poststocking and at one week preharvest for the prevalence and semi-quantitative load of GAV using reverse transcription nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR) as the detection method. The three prawn farms were situated at different geographical positions along the east coast of Australia to reduce the possibility of location bias. The three locations were: 1) Palmers Island (northern New South Wales) - 29&#176; 44&#8217; South, 153&#176; 26&#8217; East; 2) Woongoolba (southern Queensland) - 27&#176; 73&#8217; South, 153&#176; 32&#180;East and 3) Cardwell (northern Queensland) - 18&#176; 27&#8217; South, 146&#176; 02&#8217; East.  Prior to screening the three prawn farms for the affect of GAV, two criteria needed to be met. Firstly, to be able to determine if plasmid contamination had occurred within the PCR procedure, due to the high prevalence of GAV in P. monodon within Australia a high number of positives were expected and it would be difficult to detect false positives from plasmid contamination and secondly; to determine if the published RT-nPCR detection method for GAV could be used semi-quantitatively to compare levels of GAV infection between prawns. To fulfil these two criteria, firstly, a synthetic positive control for GAV RT- nPCR was developed. This PCR control produced larger amplified products in the outer and inner nest than the diagnostic test with the same primers. This technique is advantageous over traditional cloning of the diagnostic PCR product itself by making it visually easy to detect plasmid contamination and thus, prevent false positives.  To determine if RT-nPCR could be used to determine the semi-quantitative load, GAV from homogenised P. monodon gill tissue was purified on a continuous sucrose gradient. The RNA was then isolated from GAV and ten-fold serially diluted into crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus) RNA that was free of GAV. These serial dilutions were then reverse transcribed into cDNA and amplified with PCR. It could be seen that as the original sample of GAV became increasingly diluted, the corresponding amplified product became progressively lighter when visualised on an agarose gel containing 0.5 &#956;g/ml ethidium bromide under ultraviolet light. It was concluded that the RT-nPCR could be used as a semi-quantitative tool for the subsequent cohort study.  The ponds examined were categorised into four groups; i) GAV related outbreak &#8211; low production, ii) GAV related outbreak &#8211; emergency harvest, iii) no GAV related outbreak &#8211; low production, and iv) no GAV related outbreak &#8211; high production.  The study found that GAV had a strong association with reduced production from the farms. Ponds with GAV related outbreaks had a statistically higher initial prevalence (75.5 % &#8211; 80.7 %) and a higher increase in prevalence (16.3 % - 20.1 %) over the production period. While the ponds with no GAV outbreak &#8211; low production had the lowest initial prevalence (59.4 %) but the largest increase in prevalence (36.2 %) over the production period and the ponds with no GAV outbreak &#8211; high production had the lowest increase in prevalence (12.8 %) over the production period.  The association of GAV with reduced production was also seen with respect to the semi-quantitative loading of the infected prawns, as the ponds with GAV related outbreaks had the highest loading (2.6 &#8211; 2.9) (maximum being 4) and the highest percentage increase (41.8 % - 42.3 %) at harvest. While the ponds with no GAV outbreak &#8211; low production had a moderate increase (39 %) in GAV load and the ponds with no GAV outbreak &#8211; high production had the lowest increase (14 %) in load.  It was concluded that the prevalence and loading of GAV are strongly associated with the severity of disease; with a increase in GAV correlating with a decreased production. Ponds with a higher initial prevalence and higher increase in load of GAV suffered GAV-related outbreaks. Ponds with low initial prevalence of GAV but with a high increase in prevalence and viral load over the production period suffered low level mortality resulting in no outbreak being identified, yet low production. The ponds that had moderate to low initial prevalence of GAV with a low increase in prevalence and load of GAV over the production period incurred no GAV related outbreak &#8211; high production.  The second objective was achieved through the development of two alternative detection methods for GAV. Firstly, polyclonal antibodies (PAbs) from chickens and monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) derived from mice were produced against GAV and a capture ELISA was developed. Secondly, haemagglutination (HA) using chicken erythrocytes was used to detect GAV. These diagnostic tests for GAV were then tested for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and overall accuracy when compared to the RT-nPCR as the gold standard for agreement with the ELISA or compared to the ELISA for comparison with HA.  PAbs from chickens were produced against the 116 kDa and 64 kDa protein of GAV seen in Western blots. The development of the PAbs was based on the report that YHV consisted of four structural proteins of approximately 170, 135, 67 and 20 kDa. However it was later reported that the 170 kDa protein may have originated from prawn cells. The PAbs reacted to this 170 kDa. However, due to the specificity of the MAbs, this did not interfere with the developed capture ELISA. Of the 11 MAbs developed against the 20 kDa protein of GAV, all were IgM isotype. Monoclonal antibody 3K5-11 was used in immunohistochemical studies, Western blot analysis and affinity purification to demonstrate specificity to GAV.  Haemagglutination using chicken erythrocytes tested the haemolymph, gill, lymphoid organ, heart, subcutaneous tissue, eye stalk, pleopods, uropods and the central nerve cord for agglutination activity in 100 P. monodon, with the haemolymph and gill tissue giving the highest end-point titres of 1:1370 and 1:361, respectively. The sensitivity of HA was demonstrated by testing two different populations of P. monodon, which had a highly significant difference (F = 56.4, DF = 4, 88, P&lt;0.001) in HA activity, indicating a difference in viral load. By testing three other penaeid species (n = 20 each), Penaeus esculentus, Penaeus merguiensis and Penaeus longistylis, and the crayfish, C. quadricarinatus, it was demonstrated that natural agglutinins were not causing the high agglutination in the population of P. monodon. There was no effect of freezing and thawing of samples on HA activity. The speed and low cost of HA makes it a very useful tool, particularly in the developing world, for on-farm testing of penaeid prawns to indicate YHV and GAV loads which can contribute to management practices with respect to the harvesting of ponds.  The two developed tests were compared for agreement using 120 P. monodon for the presence of GAV. Initially, the ELISA was compared to the RT-nPCR and then the HA was compared to the ELISA. For the ELISA, the sensitivity was 97 %, the specificity was 65 %, the PPV was 93.3 %, the NPV was 81.3 % and the overall accuracy was 91.7% when using an optical density of greater than 0.75 as a positive result. The HA had a sensitivity of 88 %, specificity of 75 %, PPV of 79%, NPV of 61 % and an overall accuracy of 73 % compared to the ELISA or an estimated accuracy of 66.9 % when compared to the RT-nPCR when using an HA titre of greater than 16 as a positive result.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1573/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1573/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conflict to co-management : eating our words : towards socially just conservation of green turtles and dugongs in the Great Barrier Reef, Australia</field><field name="creator">Nursey-Bray, Melissa</field><field name="description">Indigenous communities worldwide face multiple challenges to maintain their unique cultural identity and value systems. In the natural resource management arena, these challenges include the imposition of western solutions to environmental management and biodiversity protection. This imposition has caused the dispossession or relocation of Indigenous peoples from their lands, a loss of traditional ecological knowledge, social disempowerment and economic inequity.  Indigenous peoples are responding to these challenges by asserting their cultural identity, developing cultural re-vitalisation programs, and actively participating in western political processes for ongoing involvement in the environmental and natural resource management domain. Nonetheless, to date, many of these programs are faltering or have failed in their long-term implementation.  Using a case study approach, my thesis examines this issue through an examination of Indigenous hunting of threatened species in a protected area. My research is based on the contention that language matters, as it is an enabling tool which reveals the knowledge and power relations in natural resource management. To this end, I compare perspectives held by Indigenous people on the one hand and government Management Agencies on the other, about traditional hunting, planning and the management of Green turtles (Chelonia mydas) and Dugongs (Dugon dugon) in Australia's Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA). To compare these perspectives I used a combination of discourse analysis, historical analysis and participant observation to analyse the development, implementation and subsequent failure of the Hope Vale Turtle and Dugong Hunting Management Plan, &#8216;Guugu Yimmithirr Bama Wii: Ngawiya and Girrbithi.  My research yielded four key findings: (i) that significant differences exist between Management Agencies and Hope Vale Community about hunting, planning and management (Management Agency discourse for example prioritised biodiversity protection, while Indigenous discourse was primarily about ensuring cultural survival); (ii) that language in resource management does matter because different linguistic interpretations within such programs have a direct impact on their efficacy (iii) that social justice dimensions must be incorporated within management regimes in order to achieve both cultural survival and biodiversity protection objectives; and (iv) that resource management initiatives can never be divorced from the impact of external events, actors and power regimes.  I thus confirm my thesis or argument that the use and understandings of language in resource management reflect power and knowledge relations, which in turn influence and impact upon the effectiveness of natural resource management programs.  Through the integration of these findings my thesis concludes with the presentation of a socially just conservation methodology to guide future collaborations between Indigenous peoples and Management Agencies when addressing the ongoing cultural harvest of wildlife (such as Green turtles and Dugongs) in protected areas.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1579/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1579/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of early life history traits on the survival of a coral reef fish</field><field name="creator">Gagliano, Monica</field><field name="description">Selective mortality within a population, based on the phenotype of individuals, is the foundation of the theory of natural selection. Even small phenotypic differences among individuals early in ontogeny can strongly affect survival and performance later in life. Consequently, variation in early life history traits can have important repercussions on population structure and dynamics. Yet, the role of phenotypic variation throughout the ontogeny of tropical marine fishes remains largely unexplored. This study examined the extent to which environmental and parental effects generate variation in the early life history of a tropical marine fish (Pomacentrus amboinensis) and the consequences of such variation for survival in the wild. Variation in early life history traits and survivorship during embryonic and larval development of the coral reef damselfish, P. amboinensis was examined in relation to water temperature. High rearing temperature (31&#186;C) strongly defined the relative number of embryos that successfully hatched and their post-hatching longevity. Embryonic mortality was significantly higher in hotter rearing environments (31&#186;C) than in cooler ones (25 and 29&#186;C) and accounted for over 54% of mortality prior to hatching across all three rearing temperatures. Under high temperature conditions, the probability of embryonic survival was largely determined by the initial size of the yolk-sac with larger energy stores reflecting enhanced rates of survival. Following hatching however, the survival advantages afforded by yolk-sac size switched to egg size, a commonly cited indicator of fitness. Yet, the benefits associated with egg size were heavily dependent on temperature. Overall, early environmental conditions and intrinsic developmental schedules had a significant influence on the outcome of selective mortality by producing substantial shifts in selective pressure through the early ontogeny of this species. The extent to which maternal condition at the time of gametogenesis affected the relationships among early life history traits and survivorship during early development of P. amboinensis was examined in a field study. Maternal condition was manipulated by altering food availability, a key factor influencing maternal energy allocation to offspring. Surprisingly, maternal condition had no effect on the number of offspring that successfully completed the embryonic phase, nor did it influence the relative number of individuals that survived to a given time after hatching. Nonetheless, maternal nutritional state did significantly affect offspring quality by causing substantial changes in individual egg composition (i.e. yolk-sac and oil globule size) and thus, the energetic value of embryos and hatchlings. By acquiring additional nutritional resources, supplemented mothers gained a fitness advantage over fish feeding on natural levels of plankton. Most importantly, however, they passed this advantage on to their offspring by provisioning their eggs with greater energy reserves (yolk-sac and oil globule size) than non-supplemented fish. Among offspring originating from supplemented mothers, those with larger yolk-sacs were more likely to hatch successfully and survive for longer periods on these reserves after hatching. Among offspring from non-supplemented mothers, yolk-sac size was either inconsequential to offspring survival or, peculiarly, individuals with smaller yolk-sac sizes were favoured. Mothers appear to influence the physiological capacity of their progeny and in turn, the efficiency of individual offspring to utilise endogenous reserves. Interestingly and contrary to theoretical predictions, there were no significant differences in egg size in relation to maternal nutritional state, suggesting that provision of energy reserves, rather than egg size, more closely reflected the maternal condition. Overall, the maternal environment greatly influenced the relationship between offspring life history characteristics and survival through energy-driven selective mechanisms. To determine the relevance of these findings to patterns of future survival on the reef, the early life history traits of P. amboinensis surviving on the reef were compared with those of individuals from that same cohort at earlier times. Growth information stored in the otoliths of individual fish revealed that both maternally-determined condition at hatching and environmental conditions encountered early in the larval life had strong carryover effects. Consistent with the findings presented above, wild individuals with larger energy stores were found to survive through to settlement and beyond in the new reef environment. Interestingly, results revealed that not all selective advantages established during embryonic and larval phases were maintained later in life. The direction of selective pressures acting on growth rates changed significantly and repeatedly during the first few weeks of post-settlement life. These changes in phenotypic selection may mediate growth-mortality trade-offs between the risk of predation and that of starvation during early juvenile life. To explore the mechanisms underlying early juvenile survival, growth histories exhibited by individuals that survived the first 4 weeks on the reef were compared with conspecifics outgrown experimentally to produce fast- and slow-growing fish. Nutritional conditions experienced by new recruits during the first few weeks contributed noticeably to observed patterns of juvenile survival. Results revealed considerable flexibility in the growth rates of young fish. Specifically, the occurrence of periods of rapid (presumably compensatory) growth may enhance post-settlement survival by attenuating the high risk of size-selective mortality. By exploring the causes and consequences of phenotypic variation in the life of a tropical reef fish, this study unveiled the significant contribution past and present events make in sculpting patterns of survival in the wild. In addition, it suggests that changes in selective pressures that shape an individual&#8217;s life are a critically important mechanism maintaining phenotypic (and hence genetic) variation within a population and, ultimately regulating the dynamics of natural populations.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1606/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1606/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bacteriophage of Burkholderia pseudomallei; friend or foe?</field><field name="creator">Elliman, Jennifer</field><field name="description">Lysogenic bacteriophage carrying virulence determinants have been demonstrated to be responsible for the pathogenicity of many bacteria. Bacteriophage, or components of bacteriophage, have also been successfully used in the treatment of bacterial infections. Burkholderia pseudomallei is the causative agent of melioidosis and has been shown to carry bacteriophage. The role of bacteriophage in virulence of B. pseudomallei isolates has not yet been determined, nor have bacteriophage been examined for their potential in treatment of melioidosis. A screen for identification of bacterial isolates of interest was developed and 50 isolates were examined. Thirty-one selected isolates were then examined for bacteriophage using techniques including; transmission electron microscopy (T.E.M), mitomycin C assay, UV assay, plaque assay and restriction digestion assay. A combination of mitomycin C assay and either plaque assay or restriction digestion assay were determined to be 96.77% accurate for testing for bacteriophage in B. pseudomallei isolates. Five techniques for the concentration of bacteriophage (commercial Qiagen kit, magnesium hydroxide precipitation, PEG precipitation, zinc chloride precipitation, ultracentrifugation) were examined and ultracentrifugation determined to be the best. Two methods of DNA extraction (commercial nucleobond AX kit, phenol chloroform extraction) were compared and a phenol chloroform extraction was modified for use. A bacteriophage amplification system involving inoculation of bacteriophage into a broth of host B. pseudomallei, followed by lysis, was developed and optimised for production of lysogenic bacteriophage of B. pseudomallei. Addition of a 1:1 dose of bacteriophage to bacteria at an O.D.600nm of 0.1 in 10-100ml of broth resulted in the production of 1x1011plaque forming units (pfu)/ml of media upon lysis at 7.5 hours post-inoculation. Lysogenic bacteriophage extracted from highly virulent B. pseudomallei isolate NCTC 13178 was given the name BupsM1 and was characterised as being from the family Myoviridae with a genome 55.1kb long. This bacteriophage was then used for infection assays and molecular analysis to determine whether it played a role in virulence. Endolysin of this bacteriophage was also extracted to determine its potential for use in therapy. Four B. pseudomallei isolates tested negative for the presence of bacteriophage (#13, #69, #83, E4) and one isolate of particular interest (NAFC), were infected with BupsM1. Bacteriophage infection was found to alter colonial morphology on Ashdown agar. Infection assays in a BALB/c mouse model were carried out and no clear relationship between addition of bacteriophage BupsM1 and virulence was found. One experiment with NAFC resulted in greatly increased virulence, but this could not be repeated. All other experiments where infection with bacteriophage was successful resulted in minor upregulation or downregulation of virulence. Examination of plaque production of infected and control isolates indicated that prophage stability may play a role in survival of B. pseudomallei as addition of bacteriophage from NCTC13178 restored lysogenic stability to NAFC in several cases. Of the expected 55.1kb genome size from BupsM1, 51.3kb was sequenced with 40.9kb of this confirmed as bacteriophage. The open reading frames were determined using ORF finder and direct analysis. These open reading frames were analysed by BLASTx for putative function and several potential virulence genes were identified, as were structural, replication and lysogeny genes. Possible virulence genes include putative anaerobic dehydrogenase and oxidoreductase genes. Putative structural genes included the terminase large subunit, portal protein, head morphogenesis, tail assembly and tail fibre genes. Putative replication and lysogeny genes included transposases, insertion elements and integrase, an RNA polymerase sigma subunit, DNA cytosine methylase, Holliday junction resolvase, repressor protein, and a weak match to cro, the gene responsible for triggering lysis. Two genes of interest, the endolysin gene and a possible ADP-ribosyltransferase gene (a gene often involved in virulence) were not identified by BLASTx analysis. Techniques designed to identify genes with limited amino acid homology across species, such as identification of conserved amino acid pattern, chemo-physical comparison and phylogenetic tree analysis including bootstrap scoring, were then used to identify several open reading frames which were possible matches to these previously unidentified genes. The endolysin of BupsM1 was extracted under nine combinations of conditions from literature , using a natural host system (B. pseudomallei #4). EDTA was found to aid lysis, while chloroform was found to have no effect. Extracts were concentrated using Centricons&#8482; and both neat and concentrated extracts were tested for their ability to lyse both killed and live B. pseudomallei #4 in broth and plate format. Neither the extracted endolysin nor its concentrate was found to lyse any of the B. pseudomallei in a form not attributable to live bacteriophage. Hence endolysin was determined not to function &#8220;from without&#8221; against B. pseudomallei. As such, this possibility for treatment of B. pseudomallei was eliminated.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1613/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1613/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Probabilistic and deterministic models of Pb-Zn mineralisation and post-mineralisation megabreccia, in the Lawn Hill region, Australia</field><field name="creator">Feltrin, Leonardo</field><field name="description">Quantitative analysis with the aid of numerical and computational modelling has been used to address geological problems since the 1940s. The number of applications developed and used to solve geological problems has increased largely because of the advent of desktop microcomputers. However, despite the introduction of mathematical-computational methods, the observational, inductive approach of Hutton and Wegner remains deep in the geological science. Qualitative rather than quantitative geology has won in the past because of the naturalistic inclination of geologists - &#8220;rather than sit on their desk typing and modelling natural phenomena, they were more interested in exploring the world with the naked eye, spending their time conceptualising models and integrating the data collected in the field&#8221;. With globalisation geologists have broadened their objectives as larger and numerous databases are available. Therefore, rather than collecting their own data, they now have new technologies to retrieve and process large databases. The drawback of this advantage is the lack of data quality verification, which can be a substantial problem. However, a statistical treatment of datasets can be a partial solution to this. The author as a geologist felt the need of demonstrating that a quantitative-computer based description of a multivariate geological system could lead to a significant improvement of the understanding of such a system. A line can be drawn to subdivide computational approaches that use inference networks based on physical laws (e.g. Geodynamic modelling) to bound variables, or empirical laws (e.g. Bayesian Probability Analysis) that are not characterised by the nature of the data (such as measures of spatial association). Alternative methods (e.g. Fuzzy Sets, Dempster-Shafer, Neural Networks) have been suggested to treat multivariate data less empirically. A possible way to improve the quantitative analysis is the simulation of geological parameters (Chapter 4 &#8211; 5). The interaction between the geologist and the computer is iterative in this case &#8211; multiple simulation leads to a refinement of chosen approximation. Nevertheless, this methodology is often biased and arbitrary. The best approach perhaps remains the validation of computational models comparing them against the experimental results and observations. The objective of this thesis was then to apply quantitative/computational tools to different geological scenarios in the Lawn Hill Region, Mount Isa Inlier. Part of this study focused on one of the largest Pb-Zn mineral resources in Australia, the Century zinc deposit. The objective of the first section of this thesis was to discover possible new mineral resources similar to the Century orebody, and comprehend how the mineral deposit formed. Two case study applications to the Lawn Hill Region at regional and mineral deposit scale (Century deposit) are presented. The first study reflects the need of data integration in a multivariate system to obtain a statistical estimate of the likelihood of finding a mineral deposit. The concepts of Bayesian reasoning were reviewed and a computer program (coded in Visual Basic) was developed to perform Bayesian modelling. The results were then compared against an expert-driven model to obtain a predictive map for the Lawn Hill Region. The analysis suggested that most of the mineral deposits/prospects are located where knowledge driven models favour the occurrence of SEDEX mineralisation. The data driven model suggests that other Pb-Zn deposits more likely are proximal to the Termite Range fault. Integration of KD and DD models suggests prospectivity for SEDEX-style mineralisation north of the Edith cluster a vein style ore. The second study involved the quantitative 3D spatial analysis of the Century deposit. The 3D model of the mineral deposit was also combined with a 2D-3D coupled deformational and fluid flow simulation for the mineral deposit. The integration of these modelling tools allowed a better conceptualisation of the variables controlling the spatial distribution of base metals within the mineral deposit. In this case the research effort was directed toward the use of computational tools to solve the classical problem of understanding how the ore deposit formed. The results obtained support (re) mobilisation and a broad scale metal zoning similar to what is observed at Lady Loretta and HYC. Results also illustrated how basin compartmentalisation can control (re)mobilisation, fluid-flow and therefore how a mineral deposit evolves in time. A comparison between the different scale of zoning observed coupled with numerical 2D- 3D results outlined that more likely Century is an exhalative system that however experienced later epigenetic introduction of base metals. Modelling results have in general outlined that classification of geological patterns can be an effective way of discriminating the genesis of an ore deposit. For instance, the textural evolution of a mineral deposit which is derived from a combination of mechanical and chemical processes (the mechano-chemical coupling modelled by Ortoleva, 1994) may represent non-linear behaviour and lead to patterning of the geological system. In this context, the relationships observed and modelled between the evolution of permeability structure and the spatial distribution of mineral grades represent an example of how understanding the dynamics of complex system provides improved interpretations. The third study, focused on the post-mineralisation Lawn Hill Megabreccia, and explores the variety of patterning of sedimentary textures and deformational features, aimed at differentiating the timing and origin of this brecciation event. The research combined qualitative and quantitative analysis of structural, sedimentary and stable isotopic features at various scales. The results indicate a synsedimentary (Cambrian) origin for the brecciation. However, the study has emphasised that different causative processes (e.g. tectonic, meteorite impacts) may lead to similar patterning. To conclude, quantitative modelling of the presented geological examples suggests that we need to improve accuracy and numerical descriptions of the system to reveal the timing of formation and how a certain geological process occurred. In other words the loss of data induced by generalisation and oversimplification (often required in computational and quantitative modelling) can reduce the reliability of a predicted answer. Self-organisation and chaos theories (Synergetics) may be a new way to approach and describe the observed patterning of geological events and could be used to provide better mathematical models to understand ore genesis, discover a mineral deposit or ascertain the origin of a catastrophic event.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1614/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1614/2/02chapters1-2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1614/3/03chapter3parts1-4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1614/4/04chapter3parts5-7.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1614/5/05chapter4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1614/6/06chapter5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1614/7/07chapter6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1614/8/08chapter7.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1614/9/09chapter8.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1614/10/10references.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1614/11/11appendices.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A conceptual and operational understanding of social resilience in a primary resource industry : insights for optimizing social and environmental outcomes in the management of Queensland&#8217;s commercial fishing industry</field><field name="creator">Marshall, Nadine A.</field><field name="description">Resource-protection policies are frequently implemented without prior knowledge of the likely social and economic outcomes. The consequences of these management strategies can, however, severely erode the ability of resource-users to cope and prosper. The conflict, political turmoil and lack of compliance that are often associated with changes in resource policies can seriously undermine their conservation goals. Design and implementation of policies that are capable of achieving both conservation goals and social and economic sustainability require a better understanding of how resource-users respond to policy change and adapt. Resilience theory provides a useful framework to examine the ability of resource-users to cope and adapt to changes in resource policy. Holling introduced the concept of resilience to the sustainability sciences in 1973 as a means to better understand how ecological systems can persist in the face of change. This has provided the foundation for a shift towards the resilience-based management of natural resources and the social systems that depend on them. Despite theoretical advances, however, our conceptual and practical knowledge of the social dimensions of socio-ecological systems remains limited. In this study, I aim to improve our understanding of several aspects of social resilience using the commercial fishing industry in North Queensland as a case study. A conceptual model of social resilience to policy change is developed in the first part of the thesis as a precursor to an operational model. In developing the model, the level of dependency on the resource and a fisher&#8217;s perception of policy change were identified as potentially important influences on social resilience. The model depicts the key characteristics of, and the linkages that are likely to exist between, social resilience, resource dependency and policy perception. The model was developed using a novel combination of resilience and social science theory. The conceptual model is tested for its applicability to a primary resource industry in the second part of the thesis. Survey scales are developed to quantify social resilience, resource dependency and policy perception, and to examine the relationships between them. One hundred commercial fishers and their families from five coastal communities (Cooktown, Port Douglas, Innisfail, Townsville and Bowen) are quantitatively and qualitatively surveyed. This &#8216;mixed-method&#8217; approach provides an opportunity to combine the benefit of quantitative techniques, which condense data in order to better see patterns, with qualitative techniques, which enhance data to see key aspects of phenomena more clearly. The response of commercial fishers to changes in fisheries policy was found to comprise four components. These were characterised as (i) a fisher&#8217;s perception of the risk associated with a change in policy, (ii) their ability to plan, learn and reorganise, (iii) their proximity to the threshold of coping, and (iv) their level of interest in change. These components were found to be strongly influenced by resource dependency and policy perception. A fisher&#8217;s perception of the risk associated with policy change was found to be significantly correlated with the level of attachment to the fishing industry and the level of employability (measures of social resource dependency) as well as by a negative perception of policy change. A fisher&#8217;s perception of the ability to plan, learn and reorganise correlated with the business size and approach (measures of economic resource dependency). A fisher&#8217;s perception of their ability to cope is strongly related to their level of attachment to the occupation and employability, the business size and approach and the perception of policy change. In contrast, the level of interest in change was not observed to be significantly correlated with any aspect of resource dependency or perception of policy change. Qualitative data revealed key mechanisms for the influence of resource dependence and policy perception on social resilience. Fishers that are especially dependent on the fisheries resource are limited in the flexibility with which they can approach policy change. Dependent fishers were characterised by a strong attachment to their occupation, older age, few transferable skills, a business approach that was &#8216;lifestyle-oriented&#8217; and rarely involved employing others. These fishers can be limited through their attitude, employability, family, financial situation and capacity to develop innovative solutions. Fishers who are meaningfully involved in the decision-making process are more likely to be resilient to policy change because they are more likely to understand and trust the need for change, and because they feel some control over their future. An operational model of social resilience for resource industries such as the commercial fishing industry is developed on the basis of these results. The model provides insight as to what determines the resilience of socio-ecological systems, generally. It suggests that the nature of the relationship with the resource can influence the ability of resource-users to cope and adapt. Policy design and implementation are also found to have a significant role in maintaining system resilience. This information is important for the management of socio-ecological systems. To successfully navigate through policy-change transitions, resource-users require flexibility (or low resource dependency) and a positive perception of policy change. This is especially true of the commercial fishing industry in North Queensland. This study has developed methods to measure these qualities, thus giving resource managers the ability to assess social resilience prior to the implementation of conservation initiatives. Understanding the influence of these qualities provides resource managers with knowledge of the important system properties that require management. This knowledge can underpin progressive management approaches aimed at more effective and equitable resource protection. For example, managers could use the approaches developed in this study to identify resource-users with a strong level of dependency on the resource. The resilience of these users could be increased prior to a policy change through assistance to develop skills to plan and reorganise, or to build capacity for alternative employment. Managing the perception of policy change is another important consideration. Resource managers may benefit from increasing the quality of communication with resource-users or by providing opportunities and incentives for resource-users to participate in policy design and decision-making processes. Improved knowledge of the linkages between people and the environment, and new tools such as those developed in this study, better position resource managers to meet the challenge of managing for resilient socio-ecological systems.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1629/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1629/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biophysical impacts and psychosocial experiences associated with use of selected long-distance walking tracks within the Wet Tropics region of North Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Young, Nigel Gordon Ryan</field><field name="description">This multidisciplinary doctoral research project investigated visitor impacts and visitor experiences associated with two long-distance walking tracks within the Wet Tropics region of North Queensland, Australia. A literature review demonstrated there has been minimal research conducted to date in relation to the biophysical impacts and psychosocial experiences of long-distance walkers in all locations, but particularly within the Wet Tropics region. Since encounters between visitors and a recreational site have the potential to generate either positive or negative biophysical and social impacts at the setting, in addition to positive or negative psychological impacts for the individual user (Bentrupperb&#228;umer and Reser, 2000), this project represented a timely attempt to examine both research avenues from theoretical and applied perspectives. Both long-distance walking tracks investigated in this research were located within World Heritage listed protected areas. World Heritage listing is an acknowledgement that locations possess international significance and places particular responsibilities upon management agencies to conserve, present, rehabilitate, and transmit their attributes to future generations (Wet Tropics Management Authority, 2000). The Mt Bartle Frere Track is situated within Wooroonooran National Park in the Wet Tropics of Queensland World Heritage Area, while the Thorsborne Trail is located on Hinchinbrook Island National Park within the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. This research utilised a range of methodologies derived from both the natural and social sciences, and a human-environment transactional model specifically developed for outdoor recreation settings (Bentrupperb&#228;umer and Reser, 2000, 2002) was adopted as the overarching theoretical and analytical framework for the study. Biophysical impacts were assessed using rapid assessment methodology following the selection of a range of suitable environmental indicators. Impacts were recorded within one metre square quadrats and along 20 metre linear transects at 100 sampling points on each track. Spatial comparisons were made among sampling zones (tread, buffer, and control), and vegetation types on each track. Temporal comparisons were made between wet and dry season results. Psychosocial experiences were assessed using a self-report questionnaire administered to hikers via a range of distribution methods over a one year period using a convenience sampling strategy. Spatial comparisons indicated that biophysical impacts were predominantly confined to the tread and buffer zones, and were more prevalent in proximity to locations where hikers congregated such as camping grounds, lookouts, and swimming holes. The biophysical impacts that were of most concern on the Mt Bartle Frere Track included track widening, exposed mineral soil, erosion, and the inadequate disposal of human body waste. Trampling impacts of most concern on the Thorsborne Trail included exposed mineral soil, human littering, human vegetation damage, and social trails. Temporal comparisons of biophysical impacts between wet and dry season sampling suggested that some track widening occurred during the wet season on both tracks, presumably as a consequence of hikers attempting to avoid muddy or waterlogged track sections. Exposed mineral soil was most prevalent during the dry season on both tracks when visitation levels were highest. Mean organic litter depth was deepest during the wet season on both tracks, with significant seasonal reductions in litter being recorded on the Mt Bartle Frere Track. Incidences of human vegetation damage were also more widespread during the wet season on both tracks. Seasonal comparisons of biophysical impacts were discussed from a recreation ecology perspective using the concepts of resistance and resilience. Psychosocial experience surveys (N = 623) provided a number of insights in relation to the profile of long-distance walkers using these two tracks. Respondents were typically young, well educated, highly experienced in the use of long-distance tracks, and primarily had experiential-based motivations for undertaking their walk. A substantial proportion of respondents were either repeat visitors or had learnt about the existence of their respective tracks via word of mouth, while only a minority of hikers had used formal information sources such as visitor information centres and the internet. While a majority of respondents positively appraised the natural, built, and social environments they encountered, many also identified a number of specific factors that had detracted from their experiences. Respondents from the Mt Bartle Frere Track were most concerned about the prevalence of soil erosion, feral animals, and the lack of track marking to assist wayfinding. Thorsborne Trail respondents were most concerned about the number of other people they encountered in camp grounds, encounters with large groups, human litter, and feral animals. Although a majority of respondents from both locations approved of current track management, many indicated their support for a range of possible management interventions. Most respondents from each track were generally satisfied with their overall experience and the vast majority would be willing to undertake their respective hikes again, although satisfaction levels were higher among Thorsborne Trail respondents. This research has enhanced theoretical understandings of human-environment transactions within a long-distance walking track context. These were explored in some detail using a conceptual mapping progression that compared the relative contributions that different domains within the human-environment transactional model make to experiences within different outdoor recreation settings. The research also made a number of scientific contributions to the human-environment transactional model through reaffirming and extending the model&#8217;s core aspects of multidisciplinarity, simultaneous assessment, multidimensionality, reciprocity and interconnectedness. Use of the human-environment transactional model has also provided a number of applied insights that may assist managers to better understand the linkages that exist between impact upon environment and impact upon people and the interconnectedness of human behaviour/experience/biophysical impact. The research has enabled the formulation of a number of general principles that will hopefully assist management of other long-distance walking tracks within the Wet Tropics region and also generated a number of specific site and visitor management recommendations for each track, some of which have already been implemented. The results obtained from these tracks can be cautiously extrapolated to other long-distance walking tracks within tropical rainforest environments provided that site-specific factors are taken into consideration.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1630/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1630/2/02chapters1-8.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1630/3/03references.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1630/4/04appendices.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predator-prey interactions in coral reef fish : the implications of predation risk on the behavior and growth of prey</field><field name="creator">Abdulla, Ameer</field><field name="description">Sublethal or nonlethal predator-prey interactions (predation risk) can influence prey species' behaviours and food web dynamics across a wide-range of ecological communities and diverse taxa. In this thesis, I explore the potential for predation risk to influence the behaviour and growth of marine animals. Local predation risk fluctuates greatly in space and time and anti-predator behaviour is expected to be selected over evolutionary times to optimise prey fitness. Flexibility in behavioural responses to predation risk is likely to be an evolutionary adaptation that mitigates the trade-offs between the costs of physical and chemical defences against predators and maximising growth and reproduction. In high-risk situations during the life of an animal, antipredator behaviour maximising survival may reduce net energy intake by an individual and potentially its reproductive fitness relative to net energy intake and fitness in low risk situations. I identify major determinants of, and common prey responses to, predation risk in marine environments. I argue that nonlethal predator-prey interactions influence the behaviour of marine species and, because of the high phenotypic plasticity characteristic of these animals, are likely to affect life-history traits such as growth and size-at-maturity. These effects may be especially significant in speciose communities, such as coral reefs, where the number of nonlethal interactions is high. I examine the anti-predator behaviour of juveniles and adults of a number of species of site-attached coral reef fishes. In order to test for a change in behaviour due to predation risk, I exposed these fishes to a caged Serranid predator, Cephalopholis cyanostigma, in laboratory aquaria. Seeking and associating with refuge was the most common antipredator response in diurnal species of the prey fish, P. moluccensis and P. amboinensis. Conversely, two nocturnal prey species (Apogon fragilis and Cheilodipterus quinquelineatus) moved away from their refuge in the presence of the reef piscivore, presumably to avoid attacks from potential ambush predators. Both size classes of the four species of prey examined reduced their foraging significantly in the presence of a predator. Vigilance, however, was primarily a role assumed by adults and not juveniles. Such differing ontogenetic behaviour and the associated selected advantages may help explain the persistence of mixed size-class groups, a common feature in social groups of coral reef fish planktivores. Moreover, anti-predator behaviour of individual coral reef fish may depend on the ecology of that species and the specific foraging of its ontogenetic stage. I then examined, more closely, predator-induced modifications in foraging behaviour of a common tropical fish, Pomacentrus moluccensis, in groups of different size and at different ontogenetic stages on coral reefs in the Great Barrier Reef. Different group sizes of P. moluccensis were exposed to a potential predator or non-predator and changes in foraging behaviour of juveniles and adults were observed. In the presence of a predator, foraging effort, estimated by the number of bites taken and foraging distance away from shelter, was reduced whilst the presence of a non-predator caused an increase in foraging distance of P. moluccensis. In the presence of a predator, adults exhibited greater reduction in foraging than juveniles. Juveniles continued foraging even in the presence of predators which may help explain maintenance of high growth rates in young coral reef fishes. In contrast, reduced foraging in adults might reflect an emphasis on survival. Prey fish in large groups exposed to a predator displayed less reduction in foraging effort compared to fish in smaller groups. This was consistent with observational surveys that show a reduction in per capita vigilance with an increase in prey group size. Therefore, aggregating in coral reef fishes, a common phenomenon, may serve to dilute predation risk and increase individual foraging effort in social groups of pomacentrids. These results suggest that nonlethal predator-prey interactions may have an important effect on food ingestion rates and therefore energy uptake of coral reef fish. These effects were mediated by prey group size and ontogeny. Finally, I investigated the effects of non-fatal interactions on prey morphology and growth, and explored how intraspecifc density may influence these effects. Using experimental manipulations of group sizes of Pomacentrus moluccensis, and a system of artificial coral reefs and cages at Lizard Island on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), I tested the prediction that predation risk would reduce foraging and growth in this species while grouping would dilute this risk and ameliorate some of these negative effects. Results indicated that the risk of predation affected the behaviour and reduced the growth rate of the prey and that these effects were most pronounced in small prey group sizes. Observational data collected from natural reefs in the immediate vicinity suggested that a reduction in per capita vigilance with increase in group size may explain the diminished individual costs of predation risk recorded in large groups. These results suggest that predators may significantly reduce the growth of a prey individual at low prey group size, but will have a smaller effect at higher prey group sizes due to a reduction in per capita vigilance. This suggests that social groups in coral reef fish systems may have evolved, in part, to optimise the trade-offs between survival and growth. Suppression of growth due to predation risk may affect population dynamics of adult coral reef fish by regulating the rate of individuals reaching reproductive maturity and/or by increasing the probability of size-selective mortality on juveniles.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1631/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1631/2/02thesis.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A novel cardioprotective therapy : adenosine and lidocaine solution in an in vivo rat model of acute myocardial ischemia-reperfusion</field><field name="creator">Canyon, Sarah</field><field name="description">Abstract 
 Background: Recently, our laboratory demonstrated that an adenosine and lidocaine (AL) non-depolarizing cardioplegic arrest solution conferred superior protection during arrest and recovery compared with the hyperkalemic depolarizing St. Thomas&#8217; Hospital cardioplegic solution in isolated rat hearts. The aim of this thesis was to extend those findings by applying an adenosine and lidocaine (AL) solution at nonarresting concentrations before and during ischemia in an in vivo rat model of acute myocardial ischemia. No study has investigated the effect of AL combination treatment to reduce ischemic injury. Yet, previous studies in the 1990s have used the sequential and separate administration of lidocaine (2 mg/kg i.v.) and adenosine (150 &#956;g/kg/ml/min i.c) as reperfusion therapy with conflicting results. 
 Methods: In all four studies, ischemia-reperfusion was achieved by placing a reversible tie around the left coronary artery of anaesthetized (sodium pentobarbital, 60 mg/ml/kg i.p.) and ventilated male Sprague-Dawley rats (300 - 400 g). The ischemic period lasted 30 min while reperfusion times were maintained for either 40 min or 120 min. Where applicable, a lead II electrocardiogram, heart rate, and systolic and diastolic pressures were recorded and mean arterial pressure and rate-pressure product calculated. The primary end points included infarct size, episodes and durations of ventricular arrhythmias, pH and changes in the concentration of ATP ([ATP]) and phosphocreatine ([PCr]) during ischemia-reperfusion recorded every 5 min. The level of statistical significance was P &lt; 0.05. 
 Experimental design: The first two studies examined the cardioprotective potential of adenosine and lidocaine using the following treatment strategies: i) three AL solutions with varying concentrations of adenosine (A: 152, 305 and 457 &#956;g/kg/min plus L: 608 &#956;g/kg/min i.v., n = 18) compared to saline controls (0.9% saline, n = 12), adenosine only (adeno-only, 305 &#956;g/kg/min i.v., n = 8) and lidocaine only (lido-only, 608 &#956;g/kg/min i.v., n = 8); all of these treatments were given 5 before ischemia and continued throughout 30 min ischemia but not reperfusion; and ii) the separate and sequential administration of adenosine (150 &#956;g/kg/min i.v.) and lidocaine (2 mg/kg i.v) during reperfusion (n = 7); the sequential administration of AL solution (A: 305 &#956;g/kg/min plus L: 608 &#956;g/kg/min i.v.) of 5 min pretreatment and again 5 min before and during 30 min reperfusion, n = 6 and a 5 min pretreatment of AL solution (A: 305 &#956;g/kg/min plus L: 608 &#956;g/kg/min i.v.) continued throughout ischemia and 30 min of reperfusion (n = 6). In the third study, 31P nuclear magnetic resonance was used to investigate the changes in [ATP], [PCr] and pH during ischemia (30 min) and reperfusion (40 min) with AL solution treatment (n = 6) or in controls (n = 7). In the fourth study, AL solution (A: 305 &#956;g/kg/min plus L: 608 &#956;g/kg/min i.v.) was compared to that of ischemic preconditioning (three 3 min cycles of ischemia-reperfusion) (IPC) (n = 6), the adenosine receptor A1 agonist, 2-chloro-N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CCPA) (5 &#956;g/kg i.v.) plus lidocaine (n = 6), and CCPA alone (n = 7). 
 Results: Seven of the 12 saline-control rats and 4 of the 8 Adeno-only treated rats died during the ischemic period from an episode of ventricular fibrillation. No deaths occurred in the Lido-only treated rats (n = 6) or in any group where AL solution was infused. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) occurred in 100% of saline controls (18 &#177; 9 episodes), 50% of the adeno-only group (11 &#177; 7 episodes), and 83% of lido-only treatment (23 &#177; 11 episodes). VT was also experienced in 60% of low-dose AL treated rats (2 &#177; 1 episodes) (P &lt; 0.05), 57% of mid-dose AL (2 &#177; 1 episodes) (P &lt; 0.05), and 67% of high-dose AL treated rats (6 &#177; 3 episodes). Ventricular fibrillation (VF) occurred in 75% of saline controls (4 &#177; 3 episodes), 100% of adeno-only (3 &#177; 2 episodes), and in 33% lido-only treated rats (2 &#177; 1 episodes). Low-dose AL and mid-dose AL completely prevented VF from occurring during ischemia. The mean infarct size of mid dose-AL (38 &#177; 6%) was significantly reduced from saline controls (61 &#177; 5%), adeno-only (56 &#177; 4%), and lido-only (66 &#177; 8%) (P &lt; 0.05) but not from low-dose AL (45&#177; 9%) and high-dose AL animals (45 &#177; 6%). 
 The separate and sequential administration of lidocaine and adenosine resulted in 2 out of 7 deaths and ischemia-induced VT (6 &#177; 3 episodes, 4 &#177; 2 sec) was not prevented while VF (1 &#177; 0 episodes, 1 &#177; 0 sec) was reduced. Infarct size (52 &#177; 5%) was not significantly different from saline-controls (61 &#177; 5%). When AL was given at pretreatment, stopped for ischemia and resumed 5 min before reperfusion, infarct size reduction (67 &#177; 8%) and protection from ventricular arrhythmias (VT: 39 &#177; 23 episodes, 84 &#177; 49 sec; VF: 2 &#177; 1 episodes, 21 &#177; 8 sec) were lost; though, there were no deaths in this group. AL solution given continuously from pretreatment through ischemia and reperfusion provided similar protection to AL infusion during pretreatment and ischemia (41 &#177; 10% vs. 38 &#177; 6%, 2 &#177; 1 VT and 0 VF). 
 During ischemia, control [ATP] fell to 61% of baseline at 15 min and recovered 68% - 88% of baseline during reperfusion. AL treatment maintained [ATP] in a steady state throughout ischemia and reperfusion with changes ranging of 95 &#177; 7 % to 117 &#177; 10% of baseline. Control [PCr] was significantly reduced compared to AL treated hearts during ischemia at 10 min (62 &#177; 7 vs. 89 &#177; 9%), 15 min (45 &#177; 4% vs 81 &#177; 7%), 20 min (44 &#177; 9% vs. 92 &#177; 9%) and 30 min (45 &#177; 8% vs. 77 &#177; 7%) and during reperfusion at 10 min (44 &#177; 19% vs. 92 &#177; 9%) and 15 min (50 &#177; 8% vs. 90 &#177; 7%) (P &lt; 0.05). The pH of AL and control hearts were similar throughout ischemia ranging from pH 7.6 to 6.4 in control and pH 7.5 to 6.8 in AL hearts. Controls maintained a mean pH below baseline for the first 20 min of reperfusion (pH 7.1) while AL hearts pH recovered to baseline within the first 5 min of reperfusion (pH 7.4 &#177; 0.1). 
 Pretreating the heart before and during ischemia with AL or with CCPA plus lidocaine resulted in no deaths, and no lethal arrhythmias. Infarct size reduction in CCPA plus lidocaine treated rats (12 &#177; 4 %) was similar to ischemic preconditioning (11&#177; 3%), whereas in AL- and CCPA- treated rats, the infarct size was 38 &#177; 6% and 42 &#177; 7% respectively. 
 Conclusions: i) The intravenous infusion of AL solution before or during 30 min was more cardioprotective than adenosine alone, lidocaine alone, or the separate and sequential infusion of adenosine and lidocaine; ii) the AL combination led to no death, virtually no episodes of VF, few episodes of VT, and a significantly reduced infarct size; iii) AL cardioprotection appears to be associated with preservation of high energy phosphates and a better balance between supply and demand during ischemic conditions; iv) low pH was not an indicator of myocardial damage in AL treated rats, and v) when adenosine was substituted with an adenosine A1 receptor agonist, CCPA, plus lidocaine cardioprotection was significantly enhanced and similar to IPC. In summary, targeting adenosine receptors, especially the A1 adenosine receptor, with lidocaine Na+ fast channel modulation may offer a new combination therapy to delay myocardial damage during ischemia and prevent ischemia-induced arrhythmias.

In the Yolngu world, a sophisticated understanding of the fluid and dynamic relationships between fresh and saltwater is given a greater priority than the division of the coast into land and sea. These waters are continually moving and mixing, both underground and on the surface, across an area that stretches from several kilometres inland to the deep sea, and they combine with clouds, rain, tides, and seasonal patterns in a coastal water cycle. Yolngu people use their understanding of water flows as one basis for generating systems of coastal ownership, whilst water also provides a source of rich and complex metaphors in wider social life.  Describing this coastal water cycle provides the basis for a critique of the way European topographic maps represent coastal space, and also for a critique of common formulations of customary marine tenure (CMT). However as a methodological tool, I use maps to provide a detailed analysis of people's connections to place and as part of a wider examination of how places are generated and sustained. In this way the thesis contributes to anthropology, marine studies, and indigenous studies as well as touching on some issues of coastal geography. The approach I adopt has a phenomenological emphasis, since it enables me to show how Yolngu concepts arise out of and articulate with their experience of living in their environment and of using knowledge in context. This perspective contributes fresh ethnographic insights to some ongoing contemporary debates about people and place.  The paired tropes of flow and movement are used as a gloss throughout the work, as each chapter takes a different domain of human life at Yilpara and explores how water, place, and human movement are manifested in it. Such domains include subsistence hunting and fishing, group and gender distinctions in presence on the country, food sharing, memories of residence and travel, personal names, spirits and Dreaming figures, patterns of coastal ownership, and interactions with professional fishermen. Together, they provide an account of the different ways that people relate to water, place and country in contemporary everyday life. &#8216;Where the Clouds Stand&#8217; is predominantly an ethnographically driven work from one locality, but within that approach, it also explores broader considerations of phenomenology, anthropological inquiry, and human life more generally.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1702/1/Thesis_with_title_page.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Students at-risk: a bioecological investigation</field><field name="creator">Boon, Helen J.</field><field name="description">This comparison study examines how socio-economic, parental and school perceptions relate to the
 motivation, coping strategies and academic achievement of students at risk of dropping out of
 school. The aim of the study was to compare and contrast students at-risk with typical and resilient
 students to derive a profile of an academically resilient student.
 Bronfenbrenner&#8217;s theory of development underpinned the study. It postulates that: a) human
 development and socialisation is context-dependent; b) parenting and school influences have an
 impact upon adolescent outcomes; c) socioeconomic factors and school environments affect
 development via socialising and psychological processes; d) parenting processes, which predict
 both academic achievement and psychological adjustment are moderated by socio-economic and
 family structure variables; and e) congruence perceived in two contexts strengthens adolescent
 outcomes.
 The sample comprised 1127 students from Years 8 to 10 attending three North Queensland urban
 state high schools. The control and at-risk groups were selected according to their English and
 mathematics grades; the resilient group was extracted from typically achieving students based on
 their parents&#8217; employment and educational level. Since 10 per cent of the students identified
 themselves as Indigenous analyses were also conducted to compare Indigenous with non-
 Indigenous students.
 A mixed methods approach was taken. A survey instrument was analysed first followed, some
 months later, by interviews with students selected from the three groups to triangulate and augment
 results.
 Comparisons of the three groups of students yielded significant differences. Students at-risk
 reported significantly higher levels of neglectful parenting, higher suspension levels, and blended or
 single-parent family structures where both parents had an education limited to high school level and
 at least one parent was unemployed. Moreover, being Indigenous was significantly linked to being
 at-risk. Indigenous students were as likely to be at-risk in Year 8 as in Year 9, with the proportion
 
 of at-risk students doubling in Year 10. By contrast, non-Indigenous students were statistically more
 likely to be at-risk in Year 10.
 Students at-risk had the lowest levels of self-efficacy, mastery goals and positive coping strategies,
 and highest levels of projective coping and self-handicapping. Their school ratings, based on their
 appraisal of teacher relationships, curriculum and feeling happy about being at school were also the
 lowest. An important finding, however, was that all of these variables were significantly raised to
 the levels of typical students in those students at-risk whose parenting was authoritative, as
 indicated by high levels of warmth and involvement and supervision. This showed the importance
 of parenting in predicting motivations, coping and school perceptions.
 By contrast, resilient students, whose socio-demographic characteristics were the same as those of
 students at-risk, reported parenting characterised by high levels of monitoring, comparable to
 typical students, though the warmth and involvement dimension of their parenting was low. They
 also reported a high proportion of neglectful parenting. Resilient students&#8217; levels of self-efficacy,
 mastery goals and positive coping were as high as typical students&#8217;, while their levels of selfhandicapping
 and projective coping were low. Unlike students at-risk, their ratings of teacher
 relationships and the curriculum were high. Once again, in contexts characterised by high parenting
 ratings, higher mean scores for school perceptions, self-efficacy, mastery and positive coping and
 lower projective coping and self-handicapping scores were reported.
 For Indigenous students, a high suspension level, paternal unemployment, a blended or single
 parent family and non-graduate maternal education significantly predicted at-risk status. When
 contrasted to non-Indigenous students, Indigenous students had significantly higher levels of
 neglectful parenting than non-Indigenous students, possibly due to the higher proportion of blended
 families within the group. Indigenous students reported significantly higher self-handicapping,
 lower self-efficacy and lower positive coping strategies. An unexpected finding was that there were
 no differences between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students&#8217; in their views of school.
 Structural equation modelling showed that school views were highly positively correlated to
 parenting reports in typical students, but this was not the case for either resilient or students at-risk.
 
 The qualitative phase of the research, the six case studies, augmented and illustrated the statistical
 results and brought forth additional issues pertinent to the at-risk trajectory.
 In conclusion, parenting can act as a valuable protective factor facilitating students&#8217; academic
 outcomes. At the same time, school processes can help foster resilience in students placed at-risk
 through structural and SES factors. This might be accomplished by encouraging a mastery goal
 orientation and positive coping strategies, which in turn are positively related to academic selfefficacy
 and low levels of suspension. Teacher relationships in particular are potential protective
 factors for students at-risk.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1732/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1732/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community safety promotion networks: from metaphor to methodology</field><field name="creator">Hanson, Dale William</field><field name="description">Injuries are preventable. However, discrepancy between academic, practitioner, community and political perceptions regarding injury causation remain an important barrier to mounting an effective response.
 
 The biomechanical model of injury prevention dominated the late 20th century. Injury was defined as &#8220;any unintentional or intentional damage to the body resulting from acute exposure to thermal, mechanical, electrical, or chemical energy or from the absence of such essentials as heat or oxygen&#8221;. This reductionist perspective overlooks the importance of the psychological and sociological determinants of injury. Safety has physical, psychological and sociological dimensions. Interventions aiming to achieve long term improvements in community safety must seek to develop sustainable safety promoting characteristics within the target community.
 
 The thesis proposes the &#8220;injury iceberg&#8221;, a unifying cognitive framework designed to facilitate productive dialogue between the academic, professional and community groups required to design and implement effective community based safety promotion interventions. The individual is, metaphorically speaking, the &#8220;tip of the iceberg,&#8221; just one part of a complex ecological system. While they may be the most visible part of this system, important determinants of behaviour and environmental risk are &#8220;hidden below the waterline.&#8221;
 
 While this comprehensive, wholistic model of safety promotion offers many opportunities to address a community&#8217;s injury problem, it also poses special challenges. The dynamic, multi-causal, multi-level nature of community safety means it is resistant to interventions designed by a single profession or agency. Promoting safety requires a multifaceted, comprehensive response.
 
 Networks have been advocated as an effective response to the complex problems that plague modern society. Health practitioners, researchers, administrators and politicians have all embraced the network metaphor. By networking, sharing knowledge, expertise and resources, it is argued that communities can be empowered to generate the critical mass of expertise, resources and activity required to promote their own health and safety.
 
 The Mackay Injury Surveillance Network was established in 1997 as part of the Queensland Injury Surveillance Network. It reported 35,211 injury presentations to regional Emergency Departments over the three year period from the 1st of January 1998 to the 31st of December 2000. This represented an age standardised rate of 12,584 per 100,000 for males, 2.0 times that observed in South Brisbane, and 6,319 per 100,000 for females, 1.7 times that observed in South Brisbane, suggesting that Mackay, like other Australian regional cities, had comparatively high injury rates in relation to major urban centres.
 
 Mackay Whitsunday Safe Communities was launched in February 2000 in response to excess injury morbidity observed in the region. In keeping with contemporary wisdom it formed a collaborative network. Given that Mackay Whitsunday Safe Communities used a social process, a collaborative network, to achieve its public health objectives, it was important to evaluate the network using a research tool able to analyse the structure and function of this social system. The standard approach used by epidemiologists and health promotion researchers is to define a population and study a representative sample of individuals with this population. A key assumption is that the attributes and behaviour of individuals are independent. However, in human systems, the interdependence of actors and their social and physical environment is an essential characteristic of human social interaction. To meaningfully understand how social systems work, research tools must be able to describe and model the inter-dependence of human social systems.
 
 This thesis used social network analysis to evaluate Mackay Whitsunday Safe Communities. Social network analysis is a quantitative sociological methodology that maps and analyses the relationships observed in a social network. By collating this set of relationships, it is possible using graph theory to mathematically describe and analyse a social system. Social network analysis therefore has the capacity to model the interdependent interaction between individuals, their immediate interpersonal environment and the overall social system. It therefore had the potential to provide unique insights into how safety promotion networks such as Mackay Whitsunday Safe Communities function.
 
 The network was delineated using a snowballing technique that followed a chain of relationships emanating from the Mackay Whitsunday Safe Communities Network Support Group over three survey waves. Respondents were asked to actively recall relationships with people they considered facilitated their contribution to community safety, including people who were not members of Mackay Whitsunday Safe Communities. This allowed the identification of an external support network that may also contribute to the capacity of the network.
 
 Social network analysis proved a powerful tool, providing diagrammatic representation of the social structure and quantifying important changes in the structure and function of community safety promotion network and its external support network. Since the network was established the number of relationships doubled from 500 to 1002, the relational distance separating network members decreased (average distance reduced from 3.9 to 2.7) and cohesiveness of the network increased (density increased from 0.022 to 0.036). There was increased tendency for group formation (clustering coefficient increased from 0.30 to 0.50) and a more centralised structure (centralisation index increased from 18% to 43%). Mackay Whitsunday Safe Communities had clearly succeeded in developing cohesive social capital &#8211; the ability to collaborate for mutual benefit.
 
 However, social network analysis also provided compelling evidence that a small number of well-connected social entrepreneurs played an important facilitative role in network activities. Whether measured in terms of direct social influence, efficiency of communication, or brokering potential, six actors were disproportionately influential, maintaining 44% of all relationships and brokering 52% of in-kind, 54% of human and 66% of financial investments made in the network. They provided an important social conduit for the transfer of information, expertise and resources within the system.
 
 In 2004 the network accessed an estimated 6.5 FTE of staff time and $0.9 million dollars. However, Mackay Whitsunday Safe Communities is an open network. It can only be properly understood in the context of its external support network. While rich in social resources, the discretionary in-kind, human and financial resources mobilised within this community network were limited. These resources were largely accessed from, and controlled by, an external support network. Open systems never achieve equilibrium, a theoretic state of in which the resources produced by the system are sufficient to sustain system function. Rather, open systems can only be sustained in steady state, a dynamic state in which the flux of resources into and out of the system are sufficient to maintain network function. The entrepreneurial bridging relationships that unite network members around a cause and facilitate access to the in-kind, human, financial and social resources necessary to maintain network productivity are therefore critical to ensure the sustainability of community safety promotion networks.
 
 Maintaining a functional safety promotion network has a cost. In this study the number of relationships maintained by network members was strongly correlated with the amount of time they invested in network activities. However, the relational pressure this placed on the network facilitators was evident. As a group they process 258 incoming relationships (43 relationships per facilitator), compared with 1.8 incoming relationships for other network members.
 
 This network analysis identified that two types of social capital were necessary to develop and sustain a productive community safety promotion network: cohesive social capital and entrepreneurial social capital. The development of stronger, dense relationships (cohesive social capital) meant that Mackay Whitsunday Safe Communities was better positioned to co-operate for mutual benefit and thereby promote safe standards of community conduct and a safe physical environment. However, to develop this state and facilitate a sustainable resource base to maintain it, the entrepreneurial social capital of key network facilitators appeared to be critical component of network function.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1751/1/01Thesis_front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1751/2/02Chapters_1-3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1751/3/03Chapter_4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1751/4/04Chapters_5-7.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1751/5/05Chapters_8-11.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1751/6/06Glossary_and_references.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1751/7/07Appendices_1-6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1751/8/08Appendices_7-12.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1751/9/09Appendix_13.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1751/10/10Appendix_14.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1751/11/11Appendices_15-20.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1751/12/12Appendix_21.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1751/13/13Appendix_22.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1751/14/14Appendices_23-25.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Small cryptic fishes on coral reefs : a new perspective on reef fish ecology and life histories</field><field name="creator">Depczynski, Martial</field><field name="description">Small cryptic fishes represent over 50% of fishes on coral reefs. Yet our knowledge of them lags far behind that of larger species and their significance to coral reef ecosystems remains unclear. Vastly different in their ecology due to their small size, this thesis examines their community structure and identifies key life history features that highlight their unique ecological status. These results are combined to model the relative contribution of small cryptic fishes to reef fish assemblages and define their significance to coral reef ecosystems.  Small-scale clove oil samples (0.4m2) were used to quantify the spatial distribution of small (&lt; 10cm) cryptic fishes across reef zones and microhabitats at both exposed and sheltered reefs. Marked variation in abundance, species numbers, size-class distribution and community composition were found among reef zones at exposed sites; in contrast, comparatively little among-zone variation was found at sheltered sites. At exposed sites, there was a strong trend of declining abundance, species numbers and larger body sizes with increasing wave energy; whereas at sheltered sites, microhabitat type played a more important role. There was little taxonomic overlap between sheltered and exposed reefs even of highly abundant species. Overall, wave energy was found to play a pivotal role in the spatial distribution of this community with microhabitat type playing a significant, yet secondary role.  Contrasting the life history (LH) characteristics of the most abundant genus (Eviota: 3 species of Gobiidae) at the two study sites with those of existing coral reef fishes in a meta-analysis revealed vastly different LH features. Otolith analysis revealed rapid linear growth trajectories and extremely short maximum life spans of &lt; 100 days (E. queenslandica 99 days; E. melasma 97 days and E. sigillata at 59 days - the shortest recorded lifespan for any vertebrate). Although settlement marks on otoliths disclosed unremarkable pelagic larval durations (PLDs) of 24 - 26 days, this represented 24 - 42% of their total lifespan. The complete lack of response in shortening PLDs to compensate for such short life spans suggests that developmental constraints may be the primary determinant of PLDs in coral reef fishes. Histological examinations indicated that Eviota mature at an earlier than expected size and showed a strong female bias in their sex ratios (1 &#9794;:1.4 - 1.7 &#9792;) indicating the possibility of protogyny or harem keeping by males. A field tagging study indicated remarkably high daily mortality rates of 7- 8% which closely matched otolith-based estimates of 4-7% d-1.  An experimental breeding study using E. sigillata revealed a frequent semi-lunar spawning pattern and batch sizes of 108-163 eggs. Although small in comparison to those of larger species, the frequency of spawning events coupled with generational turnover rates of 47 days indicated potential annual offspring production to be orders of magnitude higher than that of much larger reef fish species. Collectively, these LH attributes revealed how the smallest of reef fish size-classes respond to their vastly different ecological environments and highlight the extensive range and versatility of coral reef fish evolutionary strategies.  The relative contribution of the small cryptic group to reef fish assemblages was examined using visual censuses of 14 coral reef fish families. In total, data on 58,944 fish were utilized over five reef zones providing 86g m-2 of biomass. The clear trend among size-class distributions was one of rapidly decreasing densities with increasing size. Small cryptic fishes represented 45-90% of the numbers of individuals across reef zones with a reef average contribution of 67%. Among families, the numerical dominance of the Gobiidae was evident (11m-2 &#177; 1.4SE) with significant contributions made by the Pomacentridae, Apogonidae, Blenniidae, Labridae and Tripterygiidae. For biomass, the Acanthuridae made the largest contribution (35g m-2 &#177; 11.6SE) followed by the Pomacentridae, Scaridae and Serranidae. Small cryptic families made up &lt; 3%.  To examine the implications of taxa-specific growth rates in the energy dynamics of coral reef systems, a community growth model was produced. Sizespecific growth estimates for all genera censused were calculated over a 7-day period. Overall, small cryptic fishes contributed 79.5% to reef fish assemblage patterns of growth in length and 14% to the period&#8217;s total weight accumulation in grams. This cryptic contribution stands in marked contrast to the static biomass estimate presented above and highlights the significance of LH&#8217;s in defining community and ecosystem energetics.  Overall, small cryptic fishes make a substantial contribution to coral reef communities but differ considerably from their larger counterparts in the way they achieve this. Demographic evidence of drastically shortened life spans, rapid linear growth and high turnover rates, coupled with high average abundances and rates of mortality suggests they play a significant role in the energetics of coral reefs. This addition of demographic information on small cryptic reef fishes emphasized this role, uncovered new extremes in vertebrate biology and showcases the rich potential for coral reef fishes to test general life history theory.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1759/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1759/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coastal geomorphology in the Townsville region : a study of the geomorphological evolution of the North Queensland coast between Cape Upstart and Hinchinbrook Island</field><field name="creator">Hopley, David</field><field name="description">The coastal landforms of the Townsville area indicate an evolution which can be traced back to at least the last interglacial high sea level phase. A maximum sea level of approximately 15 feet was attained during this late Pleistocene transgression. It was accompanied by a sub-humid climate in which pedimentation was a major process. This dry climate was maintained during at least the early part of the regressive phase, but became more humid during the maximum of the glacial stage. The rise in the level of the sea during the Holocene has been paralleled by a desiccation of climate. The Holocene transgression in the area reached a maximum level of about 12 feet approximately 4250 years ago, leaving well-defined traces of this level on the mainland and off-shore islands.

Among these migrants were several thousand Iranian Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237;s, members of a persecuted minority forced by the Islamic regime, established after the Iranian Revolution of 1979, to leave their homes. Some of these migrants or their relatives spent time in prison, suffered torture and saw their homes torched. The largest number became refugees forced to hire people smugglers to escape from Iran. These migrants were highly motivated to become effective settlers elsewhere because they could not return home. The changes in immigration policies, which occurred in Australia in the 1970s and early 1980s, developed a safe haven for the Iranian Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237;s. A special program established in the 1980s to assist refugees to migrate to Australia hastened their arrival and facilitated their settlement. The data for this oral history was obtained through interviews with eighty three Iranian Baha&#8217;is in 2003. The intention was to record the immigration experiences of the Iranian Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237;s from their perspective while the first generation was still alive. It also aimed to examine the reasons why they rapidly became successful settlers given that their country of origin had a very different culture to that of Australia. The study found that the central core of their faith, that humanity is one and the world is one country, helped them to achieve successful long-term settlement. The other factor that assisted their settlement process was the presence of a well-established Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; community in Australia. There was a small number of Iranian Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237;s already in Australia, before 1979, and they provided the links that began a chain migration of skilled migrants. However the refugee assistance program enabled many more migrants than would have been expected through the traditional channels of chain migration. The Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; community provided the migrants with a social network and an acceptable identity in their host society. The immigration process was furthered by the family reunion policy and migrants who had family with them made the smoothest transition to Australian society. Women in the group with the opportunity of individual autonomy Australian society provided took maximum advantage of the freedoms it offered such as freedom to work outside the home and to seek further education. They were also free to craft an individual life style that included issues such as clothing and gender relationships. Problems encountered in Australia were non-recognition of professional qualifications and some discrimination based on language or colour. The study focused on settlement at an individual and community level and measured settlement success through issues such as employment levels and location. The findings of the study demonstrated that a multicultural policy enables migrants to feel valued in their host society. A humanitarian immigration policy is beneficial to a host society because it facilitates settlement for people driven out of their homes by war and persecution and pulls migrants who have the strongest motivation to become successful settlers because they cannot go home. The study also demonstrated that a migrant group with a dual identity, that is both a religious and ethnic identity, and one not considered mainstream in Australia, are not necessarily the harbingers of social disorder and can be an asset to their host society.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1787/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1787/2/02thesis.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Privacy and security in online auctions</field><field name="creator">Trevathan, Jarrod</field><field name="description">Buying and selling online is inherently insecure.

Various studies on this section, which contains a Barremian-Aptian transition interval, have already described its ammonite stratigraphy (Delanoy, 1995), &#948;13C isotope stratigraphy (Wissler et al., 2002), and dinocyst content (e.g. De Ren&#233;ville and Raynaud, 1981; Srivastava, 1984; Wilpshaar, 1995). A corresponding stratigraphic interval was sampled at Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) site 263 located on the NW Australian continental margin. To test the established bio-stratigraphic framework for Australia, further drillholes were chosen from two other depositional basins, i.e., from the Carpentaria Basin the Bureau of Mineral Resources (BMR) Mossman-1 core, and from the Eromanga Basin: Geological Survey of Queensland (GSQ) Hughenden-7, GSQ Manuka-1, and GSQ Eromanga-1, drillcores. In Chapter 2 the direct correlation between an Australian Barremian-Aptian marine section with European ammonite controlled standard successions, based on corresponding stratigraphic events in the compositional development of the dinoflagellate assemblages is presented. It outlines the correlation between the Barremian-Aptian part of DSDP site 263 in NW Australia, and the equivalent interval in the Barremian stratotype section at Angles, SE France. The correlation provides a suit of nine dinoflagellate cyst (dinocyst) index events, which are useful for cross-   hemisphere comparisons. These dinocyst events further enable age-assessment for the Australian dinocyst zonation scheme traditionally used for Austral biostratigraphic correlation. Palaeoenvironmental evaluation of the dinoflagellate cyst assemblages in DSDP site 263 indicates that the NW Australian margin was affected by cool water-currents during the Barremian-Aptian.    In Chapter 3 the established timeframe from chapter 2 is applied to BMR Mossman-1 located in northeastern Australia. Comparison of the palynostratigraphic framework, elaborated with &#948;13Corg data, with time equivalent Tethyan and Atlantic records shows identical bio- and geochemical stratigraphic changes and reveals an interval in BMR Mossman-1, which most likely corresponds to oceanic anoxic event (OAE) 1a. Palaeoenvironmental reconstructions are based on groups distinguished within the dinocyst and spore/pollen assemblages. These groups indicate warmer and wetter conditions prior to OAE    1a changing to cooler and drier conditions starting at the onset of OAE 1a. The &#948;13Corg results add new detail to global stratigraphic changes in Barremian-Aptian carbon isotope records and confirm the assumption that OAE 1a was of global extent. In comparison with the global sea-level chart of Hardenbol et al. (1998), the changes in palynology, carbon isotope stratigraphy, and lithology allow identification of variations within a third order cycle. In Chapter 4 the dinoflagellate cyst zonation as presented in chapter 2 and 3 is further tested by applying it to three cores from the Eromanga Basin in eastern Australia; GSQ Hughenden-7, GSQ Manuka-1, and GSQ Eromanga-1, respectively. The dinocyst events combined with the &#948;13Corg records inferred an Early Aptian to Albian age for the studied sections. The changes in palynology, isotope stratigraphy and lithology are deduced to reflect third order sea-level fluctuations. Comparison of the data with the BMR Mossman-1 core from the Carpentaria Basin reveals that the start of the mid-Cretaceous marine incursion into the Eromanga Basin is related with the earliest Aptian sea-level rise. Further comparison with time-equivalent Tethyan records shows that the Toolebuc Formation relates to OAE 1c and correlates with the inflexion point of a relative maximum sea-level fall in the earliest Late Albian. The same palaeoenvironmental groups as in the previous chapter have been used, they indicate cooler and drier conditions at the onset, changing to warmer and more humid conditions within the upper part of the Toolebuc Formation. In Chapter 5 comparison of Barremian to Albian sequences from the three Early Cretaceous depositional basins in Australia show similar variations within the &#948;13Corg stratigraphy as in timeequivalent Atlantic and Pacific sequences. The observed excursions in the isotope records from the European and Australian sequences can be correlated by biostratigraphic events. For the Barremian-Albian time interval eleven successive dinocyst events proof to be useful for global comparisons. Correlation of the selected results reveals similar patterns and responses in the &#948;13Corg records for the Tethyan, Boreal and Austral realms, and that two periods of oceanic anoxic events, representing OAE 1a and 1c, can be recognized in Australia as well. Furthermore, it enabled recognition of mid-Cretaceous stage and substage boundaries in Australia, and as such provides age assessment for the Australian dinocyst zonation scheme. The similar patterns in the carbon isotope records, and the response of the palynological assemblages from Australia and other areas to palaeoenvironmental and climatic changes during the mid-Cretaceous indicate that OAE 1a and 1c were of global extent. The first anoxic event lies within the transgressive systems tract of cycle T13, and the latter correlates to the inflexion point of the regressive R14 and following transgressive systems tract of cycle T15, indicating that the underlying driving forces for the various OAEs differ.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1803/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1803/2/02chapter1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1803/3/03chapter1_(dutch).pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1803/4/04chapter2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1803/5/05chapter3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1803/6/06chapter4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1803/7/07chapter5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1803/8/08references.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1803/9/09appendices1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1803/10/10appendices2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1803/11/11appendices3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1803/12/12cv.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Why does Chytridiomycosis drive some frog populations to extinction and not others? : the effects of interspecific variation in host behaviour</field><field name="creator">Rowley, Jodi J.L.</field><field name="description">Infectious diseases currently pose a great threat to global biodiversity. One of the most alarming wildlife disease to date is chytridiomycosis, a fatal disease of amphibians caused by the pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. Chytridiomycosis has been implicated in mass mortalities, population declines, and local and global extinctions of many species of amphibians around the world. However, while some species have been severely affected by the disease, other, sympatric species remain unaffected. One reason why some species decline from chytridiomycosis and others do not may be interspecific differences in behaviour, which may affect the probabilities of acquiring and succumbing to infections. Host behaviour can either facilitate or hinder pathogen transmission, and transmission rates in the field are likely to vary among species according the frequency of factors such as physical contact between frogs, contact with infected water, and contact with environmental substrates that may serve as reservoirs. Similarly, the thermal and hydric environments experienced by frogs can strongly affect their susceptibility to chytridiomycosis, so some interspecific differences in the effects of the disease may also be caused by differences in microenvironment use among species. I examined the potential effects of behaviour on the susceptibility of different host species to declines caused by chytridiomycosis by tracking three species of stream-breeding frogs in northern Queensland, Australia. The species historically co-occurred at many sites in the Wet Tropics, but high elevation (&gt; 400 m) populations of two species declined to differing degrees in association with outbreaks of chytridiomycosis in recent decades, while low elevation populations remained apparently unaffected. The waterfall frog Litoria nannotis, declined to local extinction at all known high elevation sites. All studied populations of the green-eyed tree frog Litoria genimaculata at high elevation sites declined to low numbers and then recovered. The third species, the stoney creek frog Litoria lesueuri, is not known to have experienced population declines even at high elevations. I used radio telemetry and harmonic direction finding to track frogs at five sites. Surveys lasted 16 days and were conducted in both the cool/dry season and the warm/wet season. The location of each frog was determined once during the day and once at night over the duration of the survey period. At each location, I recorded contact with other frogs, stream water, and other environmental substrates, its three-dimensional position, movement, habitat type, and body temperature. Retreat sites of L. lesueuri and L. nannotis were also sampled for B. dendrobatidis. Harmonic direction finding obtained fewer fixes on frogs but measures of movement and habitat use did not differ significantly between techniques. In total, 117 frogs were tracked: 28 L. nannotis, 27 L. genimaculata and 62 L. lesueuri. Frequency of contact with other frogs and with water was highest in L. nannotis, intermediate in L. genimaculata, and lowest in L. lesueuri. Environmental substrate use differed among species, and B. dendrobatidis was not detected at retreat sites. Movement and habitat use also differed significantly among species. Litoria lesueuri moved more frequently and greater distances and was often located away from streams, moving between intact rainforest and highly disturbed environments. Litoria genimaculata moved less frequently and shorter distances, and was more restricted to stream environments, occasionally moved large distances along and between streams, but was never located outside of intact rainforest. Litoria nannotis remained in streams during the day, did not move large distances along or move between streams, and was always located within intact rainforest. In addition to tracking data, I designed, tested, and deployed novel physical models to record the thermal conditions experienced by frogs, regardless of cutaneous resistance to water-loss. These models were placed in species-specific diurnal retreat sites; providing profiles integrated over time of the thermal and hydric regimes of the microenvironments experienced by each species. Microenvironmental conditions experienced by frogs differed markedly among species and seasons. Retreat sites of the most susceptible species, L. nannotis, were almost always within the thermal optimum and never above the thermal tolerance of B. dendrobatidis, while retreat sites of the least susceptible species, L. lesueuri, were commonly above the thermal optimum and thermal tolerance of B. dendrobatidis. Hydric conditions were most suitable for B. dendrobatidis growth at L. nannotis retreat sites. Species-specific differences in behaviour are therefore likely to have large implications for the susceptibility of species to decline due to chytridiomycosis. This thesis provides the first empirical confirmation that species-specific differences in behaviour are likely to affect the susceptibility in nature of amphibians to chytridiomycosis. The behaviour of the species most susceptible to B. dendrobatidis related declines was the most favourable for the transmission, growth and development of B. dendrobatidis, while the behaviour of the species least susceptible to B. dendrobatidis related declines had the least favourable for its transmission, growth and development. Species-specific differences in the behaviour of frogs in the field may also explain why infected individuals of some species experience rapid mortality in the laboratory, yet are able to carry infections for extended periods in the field. Temporal and spatial variation in microenvironments available to and used by frogs may also explain variation in infection prevalence and host mortality. Information on amphibian behaviour and microenvironmental use may be useful in evaluating the susceptibility to declines caused by chytridiomycosis in species that presently occur in areas without B. dendrobatidis.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1828/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1828/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studio music teachers and public music examinations : the quality interface</field><field name="creator">Holmes, Ivan</field><field name="description">The research focuses on quality issues within the private music teaching
 industry and the public music examination system (PMES).
 It is clear that there is a schism between the formalized structures and
 accountabilities of music in the school system and the lack of such structures
 and accountabilities with the private studio music teaching industry. The
 Thesis traces the literature documenting the rise of the private music teacher
 and the accountability rationale implicit in the development of the public
 music examination system. The dual aims of the research focus on the need to
 profile the private music teaching industry in Australia and to probe the extent
 to which the public music examination system might, in practice, afford a
 window of accountability on to this industry.
 The literature foregrounding this study derives from three areas: the historical
 development of the private music teaching industry; the concomitant need for
 certification - and the resultant development of the public music examination
 system; finally the issue of performance assessment across the relevant
 disciplines is explored to provide research direction for music.
 A limited profile of the private music teacher emerged from the first phase of
 the study. While the respondent sample was smaller than was originally
 envisaged, comparison with other studies (e.g., Gibbs 1999) suggested that the
 findings from the current study were consistent. The second phase focussed
 specifically on the public music examination system and its tangible outcomes
 in the form of the examination report.
 Five examiners were male and three female. Reports were analyzed in terms
 of the relevant examination sections with a primary focus on the Technical and
 Performance lists sections. In each section reports were segmented into idea
 units as the basic unit for analysis. Categories were derived from the data and
 each idea unit was categorized accordingly. Examiners&#8217; use of categories was
 analyzed in each section and comparisons made between examiners.
 Considerable examiner variability was identified.
 A discussion of gender differences in accessing categories generates
 hypotheses for further research. Discussion of marks awarded by examiners
 leads to hypotheses about the implications of exposure to one examiner rather
 than another.
 While this is but a small scale study and possibly the first in the music genre,
 its implications for further research are far-reaching. Implications for the
 discipline are also explored.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1834/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1834/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Habitat preferences of the terrestrial vertebrate fauna of Weipa, Cape York Peninsula</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Alexander J.</field><field name="description">The mining of bauxite ore at Weipa on Cape York Peninsula in Australia requires total extinguishment of overlying native Eucalyptus tetrodonta open forest habitat, and its effect on biodiversity and ecological services is unknown. The remnant landscape consists of a mosaic of regenerating habitats, and a network of remnant and mostly protected habitat patches of rainforests, swamps and corridors of riparian habitats. Fringing these remnants is a halo (also referred to as ecotone) of otherwise extinguished woodland habitats which are located above bauxite ore that it is mostly uneconomic to recover. For some of these habitats this study compared patterns of incidence and abundance of one hundred and ninety-five species of small to medium terrestrial vertebrates - fourteen mammals, one-hundred and thirty-two birds, thirty-two reptiles and seventeen frogs. The study sampled thirty-two sites, and employed a sampling design stratified into two bauxite ore values (economic and uneconomic), three landscape positions (woodland, ecotone and riparian), three riparian habitat types (creek, swamp and marine) and two geographic regions (the operational areas to the north and south of Mission River).  On the question of the relationship of the fauna of Eucalyptus tetrodonta open forest habitat to underlying ore value, the results showed no significant difference in the incidence, richness, diversity or composition of the systematically surveyed fauna above economic and uneconomic bauxite. At the more detailed species-specific level, significant differences in abundance were observed for an uncommon gekko (Heteronotia binoei) found exclusively in open forest habitat, and a common dragon (Diporiphora bilineata) found in all surveyed habitats. Both of these species were more abundantly recorded in woodland habitat above economic ore. The gekko H. binoei is widespread throughout the Australian continent, and is not considered threatened or vulnerable. The findings suggest that for the overwhelming proportion of the native terrestrial vertebrate fauna surveyed, in a variegated landscape the open forest habitat above uneconomic ore is most probably an effective substitute for open forest habitat above economic ore.  Unexpectedly, the survey found very strong evidence that the overall biodiversity of the fauna of the open forest habitat was as quantitatively rich as the terrestrial component of the vertebrate fauna of riparian habitats within the landscape, although overall abundances were higher in riparian habitats. The findings thus affirmed the importance of specifically and independently conserving woodland habitats in addition to riparian habitats, as part of any conservation strategy.  When analysed by class, the results confirmed that the bird, reptile and frog faunas of open forest and riparian habitats were significantly different, and that patterns of biodiversity between the classes did not coincide. The survey further demonstrated that the vertebrate fauna of open forest habitat (ecotone) immediately adjacent to riparian habitats had a distinguishable and significantly different composition to that of woodland habitats (principally due to preferences amongst birds and the presence of mostly riparian frogs), and so it cannot simply be considered a substitute for woodland habitat being lost. What was suggested from the detail of the survey was the particular affinity of the arboreal gekkos to open woodland habitats, which may be related to the presence of mature trees with their hollows and extensive bark sheeting. This raises concerns about the usefulness of treating areas of young regeneration as an effective habitat replacement for these species, and to what extent the degree of landscape alteration will risk the viability of existing populations. Although no richer in species, the survey found strong evidence that swamp faunas had significantly more individuals, and a distinctive bird and reptile composition, when compared to creek or marine faunas. The observation that many species were seen significantly more frequently in particular riparian habitats reinforces the significance of independently conserving all types of riparian habitats surveyed, which is the existing policy of the minesite operator.  The two regions that were being mined - Andoom and Weipa - had no significant difference in their total species richness, abundance or composition of their terrestrial fauna, despite the Andoom region having more swamp habitat than Weipa.  The most frequently recorded species was - sadly - the introduced Cane Toad Bufo marinus. The ascendancy of this species to its present level of abundance almost certainly explains the only conspicuously absent mammal from this study relative to earlier studies - the Northern Quoll Dasyurus hallucatus. The invasion of the Cane Toad is also the most likely explanation for an anecdotal record of a significant decline in varanid abundance by a traditional custodian. Despite intensive and extensive mining disturbance, the native terrestrial vertebrate fauna at the time of the survey was substantially present when compared to earlier surveys, and the work has provided a solid basis for identifying and measuring threatening changes in distribution and abundance in future surveys.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1835/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1835/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecological differences between rare and common species of microhylid frogs of the Wet Tropics biogeographic region</field><field name="creator">Williams, Yvette Marlene</field><field name="description">Why some species are rare while others are common remains a much asked question in ecology. As rare species are generally considered to be most extinction-prone, the importance of answering this question is becoming paramount in order to prioritise conservation efforts and resources to the most threatened species. The difficulty in gaining information on rare species which, by their very nature, are low in numbers and often difficult to detect, are just some of the reasons behind the apparent lack of answers regarding determinants of rarity. To further investigate why some closely related species are rare while others are common, this study examined the ecological differences between rare and common species of microhylid frogs in the Wet Tropics, North Queensland Australia. Eleven species of microhylid frog of the genus Cophixalus and three from the genus Austochaperina are endemic to the region. While some of these species occur across most of the Wet Tropics region, a majority are restricted to single mountain ranges. By comparing the ecological traits of niche breadth, dispersal ability and genetic diversity, in geographically restricted and widespread species, it has provided a more comprehensive understanding of what factors have shaped the patterns of distribution in these species. The niche breadth of microhylid species was measured using climatic and microhabitat variables. Comparisons of climatic niche among species showed that geographically restricted species do have narrower niche than widespread species, i.e. climate variables explaining more variation in species abundance within their range than topography or vegetation. However when microhabitats of species were described in a smaller subset of six species no relationship of niche breadth and range size was found. Geographically restricted or widespread species were either microhabitat specialists or generalist with no clear trend shown. The relationship between diet specialisation and geographic range was also investigated as a measure of species niche breath. Although macroecological theory predicts that species with broad niches should have the largest geographic ranges, I found the opposite: geographically rare species were diet generalists, widespread species were diet specialists. It is argued that this pattern is a product of extinction filtering, whereby geographically rare and therefore extinction-prone species are more likely to persist if they are diet generalists. The dispersal ability and genetic diversity were compared in a subset of three species to determine if these traits explained restricted, intermediate or widespread distributions. Similar levels of dispersal were suggested across all species however, contra to rarity theory, genetic diversity was found to be higher in the restricted and intermediate species than in widespread. It is suggested that historical habitat stability may have maintained greater genetic diversity in restricted species than in widespread species which have recolonised areas from refugia. The population parameters of species geographic range size, local abundance and ubiquity were used to generate a Rarity Index (RI &#8211; ranging in values between 0 - 1.7). The RI allowed for the comparison of population parameters (used as three axis of rarity) of each species in three dimensional space. No species were found to be rare on all three axis, that is, if a species is geographically restricted then it compensated by being abundant and/or ubiquitous on the other two axis. In fact no species were found to have RI values below 0.8 which suggests that species with lower values may have been more extinction prone and unable to maintain viable populations over time. It appears that no single ecological trait explains patterns of distribution seen in microhylid frogs. While rare species may be specialist in some ecological traits they compensate by being generalists in other traits, with past history of rainforest expansion and contraction in this region placing strong selection pressure on these species or these traits being left over from previously being more widespread. This may be one of many reasons that geographically restricted and rare species, while considered to be those most prone to extinction, have been able to persist through long geological time periods.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1842/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1842/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An experimental investigation into the effect of interface friction on bagasse compaction between grooved steel platens</field><field name="creator">Villarreal Albitres, William F.</field><field name="description">Modern factory crushing units process prepared sugar cane through sets of counter-rotating grooved rolls. A typical unit in Australia would process in excess of 600 tonnes of material per hour. Throughput and extraction performance is strongly dependent on material behaviour, the geometry and surface condition at the roll bagasse interface. Factories use welding procedures to arc roughen the tips of grooves in an effort to increase friction. Although industry procedures appear ad hoc it is clear that some level of roughness is crucial to performance. A similar statement can be made in respect to roll grooving given the wide variation in adopted practice. This project involved an experimental investigation into the effects of interface friction on bagasse compaction between grooved steel platens. An apparatus was developed for use in the SOE MTS testing facility. A factorial design experiment involving 105 tests randomised in blocks was conducted to discover the interaction between friction (the dependent variable) and groove angle, compaction, and roughness (independent variables). The results indicate that roughness, groove angle and compaction significantly affect friction coefficient. While roughness and groove angle contribute to increase friction coefficient, compaction causes a marked decrease. Observations on samples of bagasse exhibiting pure shear suggest that the frictional forces generated at the interface cannot be sustained by the shear strength of bagasse. Comparisons between friction coefficient and shear coefficient showed that the friction coefficient values approach the shear coefficient values under particular geometric and loading conditions. An empirical model was developed to explore variables. The effect of groove angle, degree of roughness (location and size of roughened asperity) and sample compaction on friction has been ascertained.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2113/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2113/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trophic structure and the importance of terrestrial wetland producers for aquatic food webs in tropical Australian estuaries</field><field name="creator">Abrantes, K&#225;tya Gisela dos Santos</field><field name="description">Estuaries support a great density and diversity of life and are traditionally considered to
 be important nursery areas for a variety of species, providing abundant and essential
 food supply and refuge from predation for juveniles of several fish and invertebrate
 species. However, to date no study has provided unequivocal evidence supporting this
 paradigm. In fact, recent studies based on the analysis of stable isotopes have shown
 that the importance of estuarine terrestrial wetland habitats such as mangroves and
 salt marsh in supplying energy to animals in adjacent aquatic habitats is not as
 significant as once thought. The objective of the present thesis is use stable isotopic
 analysis to clarify the importance of terrestrial wetland productivity as a source of
 energy for estuarine communities in the Australian Wet and Dry Tropics and to study
 the processes of energy flow taking place in these systems. Overall, material of
 terrestrial wetland origin was found to be incorporated into estuarine food webs in
 Tropical Australia. However, this importance is dependent on several physical and
 ecological factors including productivity of the different habitats, type and extension of
 wetland vegetation and connectivity.
 In a first study, stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen were used to analyse
 processes of energy flow and assess the extend to which carbon fixed by terrestrial
 plants is incorporated into adjacent aquatic food webs in two intermittently connected
 estuarine pools in the Ross River floodplain in North Queensland, Australia. The two
 pools differed in surrounding vegetation as one was surrounded by mangroves and the
 other by the salt couch Sporobolus virginicus. Since &#948;13C values of C3 mangroves (low
 &#948;13C) are very different from those of the C4 salt couch (high &#948;13C), it was possible to
 determine the importance of terrestrial wetland producers by comparing isotope values
 of consumers between sites. The IsoSource model was also used to clarify the
 importance of the different potential sources to consumers. An incorporation mangrove
 and S. virginicus material was detected for several fish and invertebrate species at both
 sites, indicating that carbon of terrestrial origin is incorporated in the estuarine food
 web. A linear negative relationship between &#948;13C and &#948;15N was also detected for
 primary producers, primary consumers and secondary consumers at the Sporobolus
 pool. This relationship was similar for the different trophic levels and was found to be
 useful to calculate trophic positions. A food web of ~3.5 trophic levels was found at
 both pools.
 In a more detailed study, &#948;13C and &#948;15N analysis was used to determine the extent to
 which carbon of terrestrial origin is important for nutrition of juveniles of four penaeid
 prawn species, and to detect and describe ontogenetic variations in diet. These
 species were selected because penaeids are known to depend on estuarine wetland
 habitats such as mangroves and salt marsh at their juvenile stage. Although an
 incorporation of mangrove and salt marsh carbon was detected, it was not of a major
 importance for any species, and autochthonous sources seemed more important.
 Ontogenetic shifts in diet were detected for Penaeus (Fenneropenaeus) merguiensis,
 Metapenaeus bennetae and Penaeus esculentus, and corresponded to an increase in
 mean trophic level as well as to changes in the ultimate sources of energy.
 In a broader scale study, the incorporation of terrestrial wetland productivity in
 estuarine food webs was studied in four open estuarine systems in Tropical Australia.
 These included a near-pristine system in the Wet Tropics (Deluge Inlet), two impacted
 systems in the Wet Tropics (Victoria and Half Moon Creeks), and a near pristine
 system in the Dry Tropics (Blacksoil Creek). Incorporation of mangrove derived carbon
 was detected for Deluge Inlet and Victoria Creek and incorporation of carbon of
 sugarcane origin was also detected for fish from Victoria Creek. The degree of
 incorporation of mangrove carbon into estuarine food webs seemed to relate directly to
 the type and extent of mangrove vegetation adjacent to the estuary. Trophic structure
 differed between estuaries, but in all areas a constant trophic length with about four
 trophic levels was detected. Stable isotope results also suggest a high level of
 omnivory and diet overlap between fish species at Deluge Inlet, Half Moon Creek and
 Blacksoil Creek, but not for the agriculture impacted system of Victoria Creek, which
 can be a reflection of the great level of anthropogenic impact in this area.
 In a final study, the seasonality in importance of autochthonous and allochthonous
 carbon for aquatic communities in six intermittently connected estuarine areas of the
 Australian Dry Tropics was investigated. Results varied between sites, depending of
 site-specific ecological conditions. The hydrology regime was a major factor controlling
 the sources of energy in these areas, controlling the amount of terrestrial material
 available to aquatic animals throughout the year and allowing the presence of an
 energetic connectivity between the terrestrial and aquatic environments. An important
 seasonal variation in the main sources of energy was detected in two systems, where a
 greater incorporation of carbon of terrestrial origin was present after the wet season.
 Hence, aquatic food webs may rely alternatively on autochthonous and allochthonous
 sources of energy, depending on the season. Trophic organization, including level of
 omnivory, diet overlap and trophic length, was also found to differ between systems
 and seasons due to differences in species composition, resource availability,
 connectivity, and type and level of environmental disturbances. While trophic length
 seems to be similar between open estuarine areas, with food webs having ~4 trophic
 levels, in intermittently connected areas trophic length was more variable between
 systems, with between 3.2 and 4 trophic levels.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1989/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1989/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiotherapy&#8217;s role in emergency department settings : a qualitative investigation of emergency stakeholders&#8217; perceptions</field><field name="creator">Anaf, Sophie</field><field name="description">The principal aim of the research was to explore the varying perceptions of what
 physiotherapy can offer the emergency department system based on the opinions of doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and patients in that system, and opinions of the community health
 sector. In conjunction with existing literature and the research findings, conceptual models
 of emergency department (ED) physiotherapy were developed to illustrate appropriate
 clinical practice and integration of the position within the emergency department system.
 Two overarching aims were to: identify different stakeholders&#8217; expectations and
 interpretations of ED physiotherapy; and have stakeholders consider how physiotherapy
 contributes to the emergency department system. The main objective was to formulate
 conceptual models of physiotherapy&#8217;s integration into the emergency department system
 based on these varying perspectives.
 This study employed an interpretivist-systems theory-case study methodology; a unique
 direction for physiotherapy research. The qualitative data sources were continually aligned
 within a broader &#8216;systems&#8217; framework. The participants represented individual elements in
 the emergency department system. General systems theory, combined with principles of Soft
 Systems Methodology, appropriately highlights pragmatic components of the research, such
 as what the physiotherapy role encompasses and how it influences emergency department
 service delivery. It is also sensitive to the meaning of social, cultural and political
 undercurrents embedded in participants&#8217; responses; acknowledging diverse world views and
 respecting the value of different voices in the research, even if they differed from the
 researcher&#8217;s own world view. Case study method added structure to the conduct of the
 research, making it further amenable to qualitative data techniques.
 Data collection used a variety of qualitative approaches including surveys of patients
 (N=80), questionnaires for community health professionals (N=35) and in-depth interviews
 with emergency department staff (N=12). The Townsville Hospital, Queensland, and the
 Austin Hospital, Victoria, were the two cases under investigation, the former having no
 official full-time ED physiotherapy service and the latter having used physiotherapy to treat
 acute patients in the department for over seven years. The varied dataset provides one of the
 most comprehensive qualitative perspectives on emergency department physiotherapy to
 date. Components of research rigour were meticulously considered and findings were
 intermittently realigned to systems theory principles to provide fresh insight into ED
 physiotherapy&#8217;s professional contribution.
 Stakeholders&#8217; perceptions were considered from a systems theory view, professional practice
 perspective and in the sphere of the broader health system. Three categories of conceptual
 models were built based on agreed features of ED physiotherapy across the stakeholders and
 two cases. The models, as abstractions, highlight appropriate integration of physiotherapy
 within the emergency department; core clinical competencies; and suitable ownership of ED
 physiotherapy to preserve its identity and accountability within the emergency system.
 The participants&#8217; voices dominate the research, creating a rich, nuanced view of ED
 physiotherapy as an Australian practice. The conceptual models attempt to unify these
 voices.
 The thesis is advantageous to the physiotherapy profession by not isolating opinion to a
 physiotherapy-only perspective and encouraging future discourse to overcome barriers,
 potential conflict and misconceptions of physiotherapy practice so that ED physiotherapy is
 better understood and appropriately implemented.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1990/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1990/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The values of meaning and the meanings of &#8216;values&#8217;:
 Environmental language in text and concept system in a Wet

This research examined environment-specific meanings and uses of the abstract word &#8216;values&#8217; that are dependent upon lexical and experiential context through language and prior knowledge. The aims were to examine and document an environmental vocabulary and associated meanings in naturally occurring contexts that appear to have multiple cultures of use and meaning, and to consider theoretical and practical implications concerning multifarious meanings of terms and constructs.
 
 The research investigated naturally occurring language use in the protected area domain of a World Heritage Area (WHA). This applied context encompasses multiple language and meaning issues in natural resource management, research and monitoring, and community consultation and participation, where effective communication is essential between stakeholder groups with often differing cultures of use and meaning for particular core terms and constructs. Theoretical perspectives that informed the research embrace cognitive scientific and social psychological theories of mental and social representations, and knowledge acquisition, elicitation and representation. The principle methodologies employed were text analysis, a lexical decision task, and concept mapping. Participants and document samples were drawn from three groups involved in environmental research, management and conservation activism in the Wet Tropics WHA in Australia.
 
 Study 1, involving text analysis, indicated that meanings commonly assigned to &#8216;values&#8217; in the WHA context reflect intersecting semantic domains of economic worth, abstract moral principles, and biophysical attributes. Study 2 compared environment specific word use with general use in the British National Corpus, and confirmed that word associations with &#8216;values&#8217; in general use differ from those in the specific WHA context. Study 3 examined the role of specific background knowledge on word recognition. Results suggest that experts and novices use qualitatively different strategies for recognising low frequency environment words. Study 4 examined the conceptual content and structure of an &#8216;environmental values&#8217; construct, revealing 81 items in seven clusters along two dimensions (affect and social orientation). The content and structure are similar to &#8216;values&#8217; typologies derived from different theoretical and methodological approaches, pointing to an underlying conceptual structure within broader &#8216;values&#8217; research. The four studies, taken together, clearly establish that serious language use and meaning problems and confusions exist relating to &#8216;environmental and world heritage values&#8217;, that there is potential for problems with effective communication and credible natural resource management and science because of these unresolved language and meaning issues, and that these problems are evident in underlying language and concept processing as well as in text-based and informal communication contexts. A clear management challenge in the protected area management domain is the management of environmental discourse for effective research, monitoring, and management of protected environments. It is recommended that the importance and role of language in designating, specifying, and communicating about important environmental constructs relating to human-environment interactions, conservation, and management be given a clearer and distinct status as an important and neglected research area and need.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1994/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/1994/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antifungal activity of plant extracts and oils against fungal pathogens of pepper (Piper nigrum L.), cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume), and turmeric (Curcuma domestica Val.)
</field><field name="creator">Yulia, Endah</field><field name="description">The antifungal and fungicidal effects of several water and ethanol extractions from plants and plant oils were studied in a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments against fungal pathogens of pepper (Piper nigrum L.), cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume), and turmeric (Curcuma domestica Val.). Spore germination of several fungi was completely inhibited by cinnamon bark and leaf oils, clove bud and leaf oils, lemon grass oil, and garlic oil (at concentrations of 0.1 &#8211; 3%), and by water and water/ethanol (50%) extracts of galangal rhizome, galangal stem, cardamom leaf, cinnamon bark, and lesser galangal rhizome (at concentrations of 500 mg fresh weight/mL).
 
 The in vitro results revealed that ethanol extractions were more efficient than water extractions in inhibiting spore germination of several fungi. The highest inhibition of spore germination were provided by the oils of cinnamon (C. zeylanicum) and clove (Syzygium aromaticum [L.] Merr. et Perry). Cinnamon oil almost completely inhibited the germination of fungal spores. Extracts of galangal (Alpinia galanga [L.] Willd.) rhizomes and cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum Maton.) leaves (at concentrations of 500 mg fresh weight/mL) were the most effective in reducing spore germination of most of the fungi tested.
 
 However, the data showed that extracts and oils were less effective in in vivo experiments. With papaya (Carica papaya L.) seedlings, germination of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides was variable. The effects of extracts and oils were qualitative rather than quantitative. Application of extracts and oils reduced the symptoms of anthracnose caused by the fungus, but their effects against C. gloeosporioides were variable. It is suggested that this variability might be accounted for by the volatility of oil leading to a reduction of the concentration of active components on the leaves. Some extracts were phytotoxic at high concentrations and this had the unwanted effect of making infection easier for some fungi.
 
 SEM observations revealed damaged spores and hyphae of C.gloeosporioides when cinnamon bark oil and galangal rhizome extract were present. Finally, the data suggest that several plant extracts and oils may be a useful source of fungicidal preparations for agriculture use.

An exploration of producer authenticity and its impact on product evaluations</field><field name="creator">Doonan, Kellie Renee</field><field name="description">This dissertation examines the persuasiveness of producer authenticity and its influence on product evaluations. Though there has been a substantial amount of research within the social and consumer psychology literature examining the persuasiveness of other source characteristics (e.g. attractiveness, expertise, trustworthiness, honesty, similarity, etc.), producer authenticity has not been empirically examined as a persuasive cue. &#8216;Authenticity&#8217; is defined as the quality of being true to one&#8217;s self. For the purpose of operationalising this construct, producer enjoyment and producer culture/ethnicity were used as authenticity cues. Three broad objectives were established for this research: 1) to establish the persuasiveness of producer authenticity; 2) to explore some of the potential boundary conditions of this phenomenon; 3) to identify the psychological processes underlying the persuasiveness of producer authenticity. Ten studies were conducted to address the three research objectives. The first three studies aimed to establish the persuasive impact of producer authenticity on product evaluations. It was hypothesised that producer authenticity would have a favourable impact on evaluations of product quality, but also on the amount individuals were willing to pay for a product. Across the three studies, results provided support for both hypotheses. Studies four and five were designed to test the hypothesis that producer authenticity would influence participant preferences when forced to choose between several service providers. In support of this hypothesis, results of these studies show this producer characteristic to be a clear service differentiator with the majority of individuals exhibiting a preference for the authentic provider. Aligned with the second research objective, Studies six to nine aimed to address the boundary conditions of authenticity as a persuasive cue. More specifically, these studies aimed to explore the potential conditions under which effects of producer authenticity would be moderated or attenuated. Study six examined the impact of producer authenticity when a producer&#8217;s formal expertise was manipulated. Results indicate that producer authenticity remained persuasive both when the producer was tertiary-trained in the appropriate field, but more interestingly, also when the producer failed to possess the appropriate degree. Furthermore, the results of this study illustrate that  participants relied more on producer authenticity than formal learning when assessing the expertise of that producer/service provider. Studies seven and eight explored the interaction between multiple authenticity cues (e.g. high enjoyment, culturally appropriate). Results of these studies are conflicting, with authenticity cues having an interactional effect for evaluations of product value, but not product quality. Study nine re-examined the interaction between multiple producer authenticity cues whilst also incorporating a product authenticity manipulation. The results failed to provide any evidence that the authenticity of the product itself detracts or adds to the persuasiveness of producer authenticity cues. Interestingly, in this study producer authenticity cues were found to be independently persuasive. Finally, Study ten examined the psychological processes rendering some individuals to be more susceptible to this persuasive cue than others. Results show that individuals exhibiting authentic preferences are more likely to engage in magical thinking (specifically the law of similarity), have more essentialist conceptions of self, have a lower need for cognition, and possess a more idiocentric ideology than individuals not susceptible to this cue. Other results revealed that producer authenticity failed to be discounted when the producer was paid for completing the task. Participants&#8217; racist beliefs (about the authentic producer&#8217;s ethnic group) also failed to influence the persuasiveness of producer authenticity when it came to evaluating a cultural product. Though the results of this dissertation contribute to the psychological literature by establishing another persuasive source characteristic, the findings also have implications for both marketers and consumers, which are also discussed.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2002/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2002/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of finite strain constitutive model for semicrystalline polymers</field><field name="creator">Holmes, David William</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the development of a constitutive model for the finite strain deformation of semicrystalline polymers is presented. It reports on the formulation and numerical implementation of the model and the theoretical aspects of the associated experimental testing and parameter estimation.
 
 Within both academia and industry to date, there exists no single constitutive model for semicrystalline polymers that is broadly accepted as representing the general case. This is in spite of the relatively complete scientific understanding of the material's response and the increasing use of such materials where structural loading can be significant. Numerical representation of such materials conventionally involves over-simplification of response, largely necessitated by the limitations of current experimental testing methods. A complex constitutive theory is only as powerful as the experimental method from which its parameters are fit. As such, the objective of this research was to develop a complete, generalized constitutive theory for semicrystalline polymers with a corresponding testing methodology that enables its practical use within industry.
 
 The constitutive model selected can be characterized by a parallel combination of elastic, viscoelastic and viscoplastic model elements which most closely represents the complete deformation behavior of semicrystalline polymers in the pre-necking region (" &lt; 15%). The accompanying mathematics are formulated for 3D, finite strain and are based on thermodynamic dissipation in keeping with conventional continuum mechanics methodology. Strain hardening has been found to be of importance within the viscoplastic element. The parallel configuration of the three model elements facilitates the decoupled algorithmic treatment of each response. This has been carried out in principal space, given the assumption of isotropy, making practical both its numerical implementation and the physical determination of model parameters. A strategy analogous to classical return mapping is used for solution of the viscoelastic evolution while a new, principal space, closest point projection return mapping algorithm has been developed for solution of the viscoplastic evolution, accounting for isotropic strain hardening. The consistent algorithmic tangential modulus is formulated to ensure quadratic convergence of the whole implicit finite element procedure.
 
 The computational model has been verified through a series of simple finite element tests involving combinations of large strain normal and shear loadings, and large rigid body rotations. Several example problems have been solved as demonstration of the models versatility. Using the developed model, a study using numerical simulations of uniaxial and biaxial tensile testing methods has been carried out. Through this study it has been possible to develop an experimental methodology to isolate the component stress contributions from each of the three deforming modes as well as subset separation of viscous, yield, and isotropic hardening stresses for viscoplasticity. Via conventional optimisation procedures and an additionally developed iterative procedure for the viscoelastic response, this testing methodology makes possible the full specification of the model parameter set. Verification of the testing methodology was done via comparison between the calculated test curves, and values output directly from the numerical simulations.
 
 The model proposed in this thesis corresponds to a general account of semicrystalline polymer constitutive response, possessing capabilities not accounted for previously in theories within the literature. Perhaps the most significant outcome from this work is the experimental data processing methodology that allows such a complex model to be accurately and practically fit to real materials. Being able to better predict the loaded response of semicrystalline polymers is critical for their continued and increased use in circumstances where structural loads are possible.

Previous research has demonstrated that worker burnout has more to do with the workplace environment than the characteristics of individual workers. It was therefore extrapolated that the same would apply to worker engagement. The current research sought to expand previous findings and tease out some commonalities in respondent experiences of engagement and burnout in the workplace.
 
 The workplace context for respondent experience was defined by the Areas of Worklife Survey (AWS) which includes the areas of workload, control, reward, community, fairness and values. It was thought that matches or mismatches on the AWS would provide a sense of respondents&#8217; understandings of their psychological contract. Further information about the workplace was provided by responses in regard to the factors of management trustworthiness and procedural justice. A model of projected relationships of the variables predicted that favourable responses on those variables describing work context would be predictive of worker engagement, as defined by the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES) and unfavourable responses would predict worker burnout, as defined by the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI). It was also predicted that management trustworthiness, procedural justice and fairness (AWS) measures would demonstrate a great deal of overlap.
 
 The research plan involved three stages. Firstly, as most previous research had been conducted within larger organisational settings, small group interviews were conducted for people working within small and micro business settings. The second stage of the research included two phases of the same workplace survey, a pen and paper edition that surveyed teachers working in independent schools; and an online version that surveyed people representing 28 different occupational groups. Telephone interviews with 20 respondents to the survey comprised the third stage of the research.
 
 Data analysis found that the interviews from small and micro business fitted AWS parameters well, with participants indicating that their businesses operated within very fine lines in terms of economics and staffing, yet they were rewarded in terms of control, community, and a sense of achievement. The inclusion of small and micro business categories within the subsequent survey instrument found that there were no significant differences between categories of business in regard to any of the study variables.
 
 Statistical analyses of the data included a K-means cluster analysis of a subgroup ofthe combined survey respondents. This identified five groups of survey respondentsbased on their levels of response to burnout and engagement. The groups were: TheEmpowered Group; the Under Pressure Group; The Unengaged Group; The Burnout Experience 1 Group and The Severe Burnout Group. As well as demonstrating distinctive profiles in regard to the burnout and engagement measures, subsequent analyses involving the workplace context variables provided support for the research model. A three factor confirmatory analysis of the management trustworthiness, procedural justice and fairness (AWS) variables that confirmed these measures covered considerable common ground.
 
 In addition, path analyses found that the AWS variables worked as predictors for engagement and burnout for three of the cluster groups, but other factors must be sought for an explanation of engagement in The Under Pressure Group and the Unengaged Group. In addition, The Unengaged Group, members of which reported ambivalence on the UWES and were not experiencing burnout, was found to consist of two subgroups: one of which reported matches on the AWS variables and the other reported mismatches. Data from participant interviews were also organised within the cluster groups. These supported the previous findings within this research and provided a great deal of insight into particular patterns of participant response, leading to refinement of the research model.
 
 The current research found that AWS variables are important predictors of burnout and engagement and emphasises the substantial role played by management in promoting employee well being. The original contribution made by this research lay in the definition and detailed description of a middle group which represented 30% of respondents. Some of these people reported experiencing disillusionment with their chosen career paths. Others of this group were experiencing some discomfort within their work environments that had not translated into a burnout experience for them. This would indicate that further research might investigate the experiences of those that fall between the two extremes of burnout and engagement in order to better differentiate these variables in the interest of providing organisations with skills for promoting the engagement of employees.

It was hypothesized that testicular spermatozoa need to pass through the regions of the epididymis in order to acquire the ability to bind to the oviduct.
 
 Spermatozoa were collected from the rete testis and the caput, corpus and cauda epididymides from 10-14 month-old Large White or Large White x Landrace boars. Boars were first unilaterally castrated and then slaughtered four to five weeks later to obtain the second testicle, epididymis and seminal vesicles. Oviducts were obtained from slaughtered pre-pubertal gilts and explants from the isthmus and ampulla prepared. Spermatozoa were suspended in modified Androhep medium, added to oviduct explants and incubated at 390 C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in air for 15 minutes. The number of spermatozoa attached to 1.25 mm2 of explant was counted after fixation and staining of explants.
 
 The possibility of using oviducts from slaughtered cows rather than porcine oviducts was examined using ejaculated spermatozoa. Significantly more ejaculated spermatozoa bound to the isthmus of gilts than cows hence, porcine oviducts were used in the succeeding experiments. There was a sequential increase in the number of spermatozoa that bound to the oviductal epithelium from the rete testis to the cauda epididymidis (2 &#177;0.30, 4.36 &#177;0.53, 9.3 &#177;1.60 and 15&#177;1.22 for rete testis, caput corpus and caudal spermatozoa on isthmic explants, respectively). Significantly more (P &#8804;0.05) spermatozoa, either ejaculated or epididymal, bound to isthmus than ampulla explants (26.33&#177;2.27 and 13.55&#177;1.42 ejaculated spermatozoa on isthmic and ampullary explants, respectively).
 
 Incubation in medium containing albumin and asialofetuin which are known to contain mannose and lactose respectively inhibited the binding of epididymal spermatozoa to oviduct explants (3.42&#177;0.56 caudal spermatozoa on isthmic explants in medium with albumin and 14.75&#177;2.02 caudal spermatozoa on isthmic explants in modified Androhep medium).The number of spermatozoa from the caput and corpus that bound to oviduct explants significantly (P &#8804;0.05) increased after incubation in caudal fluid for 30 minutes (7.52&#177;1.10 and 12.78&#177;1.64 corpus spermatozoa on isthmic explants for modified Androhep and caudal fluid, respectively). This result suggests that caudal fluid has distinct features that directly or indirectly influence the attachment of spermatozoa to oviduct epithelium. The motility of spermatozoa also decreased after incubation in caudal fluid for 30 minutes. This result is not surprising because in vivo, spermatozoa remain in a quiescent state during storage in the cauda epididymidis.
 
 Exposure of epididymal spermatozoa to seminal plasma for 30 minutes significantly reduced the number of spermatozoa that bound to oviduct explants while exposure for one minute significantly increased the number of bound caput spermatozoa. Incubation in seminal plasma also caused capacitation of spermatozoa and this is the likely reason for the reduction in the number of bound spermatozoa. There is also the possibility that some components in the seminal plasma may form a coating over the plasma membrane of spermatozoa sufficient to inhibit the expression of pre-existing binding molecules. On the other hand, the seminal plasma may also be a source of binding molecules for immature caput spermatozoa. There was an increase in the motility of spermatozoa after exposure to seminal plasma.
 
 In conclusion, this study found that as spermatozoa pass down the epididymis, there is an increase in the number of spermatozoa that bind to oviduct explants. This result was interpreted to mean that the maturation of spermatozoa in the epididymis involves the acquisition of the ability to bind to oviduct epithelium.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2007/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2007/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stock structure of a coral reef fish, Plectropomus leopardus: identification and implications for harvest strategy evaluation</field><field name="creator">Bergenius, Mikaela A.J.</field><field name="description">The recognition of stocks, or spatially separate groups of individuals with persistent
 differences in biological characteristics, is important for the sustainable and
 optimised use of fisheries resources. Stocks with different biological characteristics
 may respond differently to harvest and therefore have different vulnerabilities to
 over-exploitation. Recent research suggests that spatial variation in biological
 characteristics at a range of scales is a feature of many coral reef fishes. An
 investigation of the temporal stability of spatial differences and the identification of
 stocks that may require separate management strategies, however, has rarely been
 undertaken for such fish. Moreover, little is known about the implications of spatial
 differences in biological characteristics for spatially separate components as well as
 entire populations of coral reef fishes when subject to various levels of harvest.
 
 This thesis has four primary aims: 1) to investigate the use of otolith
 chemistry as an indirect indicator of stock structure of three exploited epinepheline
 serranid coral reef fishes, Plectropomus leopardus, Cephalopholis cyanostigma and
 Epinephelus fasciatus, on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia; 2) to investigate
 the use of otolith morphology as an indirect indicator of stock structure of P.
 leopardus; 3) to investigate the spatial and temporal patterns in life history
 characteristics of P. leopardus as direct manifestations of stock structure; and 4) to
 examine the implications of spatial variability in life history characteristics of P.
 leopardus for harvest strategy evaluation.
 
 The first two aims were achieved by comparing otolith chemistry (Mn, Sr,
 Ba) and otolith morphology (otolith length, width, area, perimeter, circularity,
 rectangularity and Fourier Harmonics) variables among four regions of the GBR, separated by 100s of kilometres, as well as among three reefs 100s &#8211; 1000s of meters
 apart within each region. The temporal stability in otolith chemistry and morphology
 signals was also examined by comparing two cohorts of P. leopardus and individuals
 of C. cyanostigma and E. fasciatus from the same cohorts that were collected two
 years before and two years after a significant weather disturbance (Tropical Cyclone
 Justin) in March 1997. Persistent differences in otolith chemistry were found at both
 broad and fine spatial scales, and differences in otolith morphology were seen at
 mainly broad spatial scales. Moreover, some aspects of chemical and morphological
 signals differed between cohorts and individuals collected before and after the
 Cyclone. The results highlight the need to incorporate data from several years in
 studies using these techniques to discriminate temporary and possibly misleading
 signals from those that indicate persistent spatial structure in stocks. These results
 provide a good starting point for future research on groups of individuals that have
 lived at least part of their lives in different environments and therefore may have
 different biological characteristics, although otolith chemistry and morphology
 should not be used in isolation to determine stock structure.
 
 The third aim was achieved by comparing vital life history characteristics of
 P. leopardus at the same broad regional and finer reef scale as the otolith chemistry
 and morphology. Temporal stability in stock structure was examined by comparing
 biological parameters among five consecutive years, from 1995 to 1999. The results
 matched the patterns indicated by otolith chemistry and morphology and emphasised
 that the stock structure of P. leopardus is far more complex than assumed previously.
 Mortality, growth, age richness and longevity of P. leopardus varied among reefs
 within regions and some estimates of growth and longevity also varied at the larger
 regional spatial scale. Several of the spatial patterns in these biological parameters were complicated by inter-annual variation. Similar to the use of otolith chemistry
 and morphology, the life history results emphasised the importance of a multi-scaled
 sampling design, including a temporal component, when using biological
 characteristics to investigate the stock structure of tropical reef fishes. I proposed a
 theoretical model for conceptualising the stock identification and management
 challenge for P. leopardus that may be composed of a complex network of reef
 subpopulations, groups of subpopulations (i.e., regions), and potential stocks with
 persistent differences in biology.
 
 The fourth aim was achieved using a spatially-structured management
 strategy evaluation model developed for P. leopardus harvested by the GBR line
 fishery. Relative spawning biomass of the population was estimated from simulations
 of four hypothetical scenarios of spatial variation in life history characteristics under
 each of five hypothetical effort scenarios. The life history scenarios involved
 simulating the P. leopardus population with or without differences in a) individual
 growth and b) mortality rates among four regions of the GBR. The different effort
 scenarios involved shifting fishing effort among the four regions. The effects of
 regional closures (no effort) were also examined. Trajectories of mean relative
 spawning biomass were compared among the different combinations of spatial and
 effort scenarios. Relative mean spawning biomass trajectories were also compared
 between two analytical approaches involving aggregating results over regions, as is
 usually done in fisheries assessments, or treating results separately for each region.
 The latter comparison directly assessed the impacts of erroneously assuming an
 homogeneous stock despite regional variation in life history parameters.
 
 Including spatial variation in growth and mortality resulted in greater
 depletions of relative spawning biomass and longer times to recover relative to exploitation levels for the population as a whole, as well as for several regions.
 Aggregating results across regions masked important region-specific patterns in the
 relative spawning biomass trajectories arising from spatial variation in biology, and
 so resulted in the wrong conclusions about whether particular management
 objectives were likely to be realised. These results suggest that spatial variation in
 growth, in particular, mortality and potentially other life history characteristics
 should be incorporated in future harvest strategy evaluations for P. leopardus.
 Further, the results suggest that the single management unit currently in place for P.
 leopardus on the GBR may need to be divided into finer spatial units to closer reflect
 biological stock units to deliver prudent biologically optimal harvests.
 
 The results clearly have some important implications for the management and
 harvest of P. leopardus on the GBR. P. leopardus, and probably many other
 exploited coral reef fishes, should not be viewed or managed as single homogenous
 populations. Instead these populations should be considered as complex networks of
 spatially and temporally varying components which although interlinked, may
 require separate management strategies to assure their long-term sustainability and
 optimal harvest.

Steven C.</field><field name="description">The allied rock-wallaby, Petrogale assimilis, is a medium-sized, monomorphic,
 continuously-breeding macropodid marsupial that lives in rocky habitats in the climatically
 unpredictable wet-dry tropics of north-eastern Australia. Long-term capture-recapture records of individually marked P. assimilis from an isolated population inhabiting Black Rock, a sandstone escarpment in western Queensland, were used to investigate the population demography of the species over 12 years.
 
 In natural populations, both extrinsic environmental variation and intrinsic density-dependence
 contribute to variability in demographic fitness components. Changes in these fitness
 components, and trade-offs between them, determine the dynamics of populations. Almost no
 information is available on the temporal variability of the demographic fitness components and
 their relationship with rates of population change for kangaroos and wallabies. This research
 provides the first long-term study of a macropod species that is based on individually-marked
 animals, which are required to estimate such fitness components and their temporal variation. A major aim of this research was to determine the impact of variability in the fitness components on the population dynamics of this macropod species, and to compare these results with those available for other long-lived herbivores. The demographic components of the life history of P. assimilis at Black Rock were investigated, along with the interrelationships between long-term temporal variability in these components and intrinsic and extrinsic factors, and individual fitness. The long-term fitness of the population and the influence of temporal covariation between the demographic components on variability in population fitness were also examined.
 
 The growth relationship between the size and age of P. assimilis at Black Rock was determined using various nonlinear models within a mixed-effects framework. The age and individual variation in growth of animals of unknown age were estimated from measurements of body size. Parametric nonlinear models did not fit the growth pattern, but semi-parametric spline models adequately described the growth pattern and accounted for individual variation. Differences in growth between the sexes were small, suggesting no strong sexual size dimorphism in P. assimilis. Growth rates were highest during pouch development, were lower during the weaning period, and decreased dramatically after weaning. The age structure of the population of P. assimilis at Black Rock varied substantially over the study period.
 
 The log-transformed relationships between body mass and various body size measures were
 nonlinear and the head length was the best predictor of body mass of P. assimilis at Black
 Rock. Indices of body condition were calculated from the residuals of mixed-effects models that estimated the form of the size-mass relationship using splines. Substantial variation in body condition was explained by annual and seasonal variability and lagged rainfall, as well as variation between individual animals. Variation in body condition was not associated with sex or age-class, and did not depend on the lactation status of females. The estimated index of body condition appeared to represent the nutritional status of individual P. assimilis at Black Rock and was used as a predictor of variation in demographic rates associated with individual fitness.
 
 Directional goodness-of-fit tests for Cormack-Jolly-Seber capture-recapture models showed
 that individual P. assimilis at Black Rock had a trap happy response to capture. The likelihood
 of recapture varied over time and depended on whether animals were captured on the previous sampling occasion. Recapture probability was generally very high, and was lower for adult females not marked as young than for other females marked as young and for all males,
 regardless of age at marking. Similar effects on recapture probability were identified using
 generalised linear mixed models, though the time-dependent effect could be simplified to a year by season interaction plus the effect of trapping effort. There was strong agreement between estimates of population size based on different methods. Population size fluctuated
 substantially over the study with periods of consistent increase and decline, and showed
 evidence of rapid population recovery from relatively low numbers under positive environmental conditions.
 
 Support for the Trivers-Willard hypothesis (TWH), which states that if the costs of reproduction differ between the sexes then the offspring sex ratio will vary depending on the parent&#8217;s ability to allocate resources, was evaluated. The sex ratio at birth was equal and not correlated with mother&#8217;s age, body mass or body condition. Sex ratio varied seasonally; being female-biased in the mid- to late-dry season and male-biased in the late dry and early wet seasons. Survival from birth to pouch emergence was correlated with environmental conditions, depending on sex, in the direction consistent with TWH; male survival was higher than female survival under good conditions and lower under poor conditions. Also, survival was higher for pouch young of heavier mothers or mothers in good condition. Survival to pouch emergence was also density-dependent. In support of TWH, the sex ratio at pouch emergence was male-biased under good environmental conditions and was male-biased for mothers in good condition or heavier mothers. Mothers in good condition produced offspring in good condition, satisfying an assumption of TWH, and higher mass at pouch emergence resulted in improved survivorship to weaning.
 
 Survival from pouch emergence to weaning was higher for females than males, and was
 positively correlated with environmental conditions. Females had higher survival to weaning
 than males in the hotter seasons, but there was no sex difference in survival in the cooler
 seasons. Survival was also higher for females than for males born to lighter mothers, but there
 was no difference between the sexes born to heavier mothers. Male-biased sex ratios at
 weaning were observed under good environmental conditions and for mothers with higher body
 mass, providing support for TWH at this life history stage. The body mass of offspring at weaning was correlated with maternal body mass, satisfying an assumption of TWH, and
 offspring mass was also higher under high rainfall conditions. Patterns of variability in the sex
 ratio and pre-weaning survival of P. assimilis at Black Rock were influenced by a combination
 of: (1) adaptive allocation of resources between the sexes depending on maternal condition;
 and (2) non-adaptive extrinsic modification associated with environmental stochasticity, allowing
 mothers to respond quickly in a variable environment to maximise their current reproduction and
 future survival.
 
 Male P. assimilis matured later and were heavier at maturity than females. Early maturity was
 favoured for females but not for males under high rainfall conditions, independent of size at
 maturity. Age at maturity was density-dependent for males only, with delayed maturity at lower
 population sizes. Maturation was delayed for both sexes when body mass at weaning was low
 relative to individuals with high weaning mass.
 
 Subadult male survival was lower than for females, and survival of both sexes increased under
 high rainfall conditions. Adult survival was higher than subadult survival, independent of sex,
 and survival of older adults was lower than that of prime-aged adults, indicating senescence.
 Survival increased under positive climatic conditions and was density-dependent, with lower
 survival at high population sizes. Males had lower survival to sexual maturity than females, and
 increased body mass improved survival for both sexes. Population growth rate was most
 sensitive to changes in prime-aged adult survival, as is typical for longer-lived vertebrates. The
 temporal variance in the juvenile survival stages was much higher than in adult survival.
 Therefore, consistent with other longer-lived, iteroparous vertebrates, the impact of relative
 changes to adult survival on population growth were much greater than changes of the same
 magnitude to either survival in the juvenile stages, or to the fecundity rate.
 
 There was a negative relationship between temporal variation in the demographic rates and
 their sensitivities, indicating that the more variable vital rates had low effects on long-term
 population growth. The most variable demographic rates covaried suggesting that common
 factors contributed to temporal variability. Covariation in survival between the juvenile and
 pre-maturity life history stages accounted for most of the variability in the population growth
 rate, indicating survivorship in the juvenile stages was more important than adult survival in
 determining changes in the population growth rate of P. assimilis at Black Rock. The survival
 patterns of different life history stages were variable for P. assimilis at Black Rock, and
 responded differently to environmental variability and population density. Density-dependent
 and density-independent limiting factors primarily acted on the juvenile survival components of
 the life history, and covariation among these fitness components influenced the dynamics of the
 population. Survival of prime-aged adult P. assimilis at Black Rock was much less sensitive to 
 these limiting factors, showed the highest elasticity, and appeared to be buffered against
 temporal variability. These results add to growing evidence from natural populations that natural
 selection may favour traits that are highly buffered against environmental variability.

 temperate reef fishes at multiple spatial scales</field><field name="creator">Curley, Belinda G.</field><field name="description">Knowledge of scales of dispersal and levels of population connectivity is critical for
 understanding population dynamics and effective management of reef fishes. These
 processes are important for effective design of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) particularly
 if they are to generate &#8216;spillover&#8217; and &#8216;recruitment effects&#8217;. Despite this, empirical data
 across appropriate spatial and temporal scales are limited. This is the first study to focus on
 dispersal and population connectivity for temperate reef fishes in central NSW, Australia, at
 scales relevant to the implementation of MPAs (100's m - 100's km). The study provides:
 (1) empirical data on the localised benefits of small MPAs relative to the mobility of
 exploited reef fishes; (2) baseline data on the utility of different methods (microsatellite
 markers and otolith chemistry) for determining levels of population connectivity, and
 potential scales of benefits of MPAs to unprotected areas. Work on microsatellite markers
 compared population genetic structure in species which span the post-settlement dispersal
 potentials of reef fishes in this region, and provides a benchmark for understanding general
 mechanisms which govern gene flow, and population connectivity, in central NSW.
 
 The response of exploited reef fishes to the establishment of small MPAs (&#8804; 0.2 km2), was
 investigated relative to knowledge of post-settlement movement. Two established MPAs
 were surveyed: Cabbage Tree Bay (CTB) a 2.5 year old &#8216;no-take&#8217; MPA, and Gordon's Bay
 (GB) a 12.5 year old MPA closed to spear fishing only. Abundances and sizes of four
 &#8216;sedentary&#8217; and three &#8216;mobile&#8217; fishes within each MPA were compared with three control
 locations at six times over two years. Temporal variation in abundances suggested that
 MPAs did not encompass the movement of most species, with the exception of two
 &#8216;sedentary&#8217; species (Cheilodactylus fuscus and Achoerodus viridis). However,
 generalizations could not be made between estimated mobility, duration of protection and
 MPA response. Densities of legal-sized C. fuscus were 2.8-times higher and fish were larger
 within GB relative to controls. Legal C. fuscus were more abundant in shallow areas of GB
 indicating that spear fishing influences local depth distributions. Surprisingly, mean
 densities of legal-sized &#8216;mobile&#8217; Acanthopagrus australis were 2.6-times higher in CTB
 relative to controls, with a similar trend for GB, and for Girella tricuspidata in CTB.
 Response of &#8216;mobile&#8217; species to protection was indicative of pre-existing differences
 between MPAs and controls, immigration rather than recruitment of fish, and/or
 intraspecific variation in movement. The lack of detectable effect for all other species and
 differential response between MPAs were attributed to mobility relative to the scale of
 MPAs, inadequate protection of habitats or depths, population recovery time, and partial
 protection versus 'no-take' status of MPAs. Overall results emphasise that small MPAs can
 have significant ecological value, even for highly mobile species. Importantly, as MPAs
 become smaller their location relative to habitat and depth, local aggregations, recruitment
 'hotspots', adjacent habitats, and existing fishing pressure is critical in determining
 responses and rates of recovery.
 
 Microsatellite markers were developed to provide information on population connectivity at
 scales &#8804; 400 km for reef fishes with low (Parma microlepis) and high post-settlement
 dispersal capabilities (G. tricuspidata). It was hypothesized that P. microlepis would exhibit
 spatial genetic structure and a significant pattern of isolation-by-distance (IBD) at these
 scales, whereas G. tricuspidata would not. Genetic differentiation at seven microsatellite
 loci in P. microlepis, and six loci in G. tricuspidata were examined across multiple spatial
 scales. P. microlepis was collected from; sites (separated by 1-2 km), nested within
 locations (separated by 10-50 km), nested within three regions (separated by 70-80 km).
 G. tricuspidata were collected from a subset of the locations sampled for P. microlepis.
 This included five locations (separated by 50-60 km) spanning three sampling regions
 (separated by 70-100 km). There was no evidence that post-settlement dispersal capabilities
 influenced genetic structure. Broad-scale genetic homogeneity and lack of IBD was well
 supported for both species. The proportion of the total genetic variation attributable to
 differences among sampling regions, locations or sites was effectively zero (e.g. &#934;PT &#8804;
 0.003 and RST &#8804; 0.004). The geographic distribution of genetic diversity and the high
 polymorphism (P. microlepis, HE 0.21-0.95; G. tricuspidata, HE 0.65-0.97) was indicative
 of high mutation rates, large effective population sizes, and high rates of gene flow. Genetic
 homogeneity for fishes and invertebrates in central NSW suggests that gene flow important
 to genetic structure is driven by factors influencing pre-settlement dispersal such as the East
 Australian Current (EAC) and habitat continuity. Thus, genetic homogeneity is likely in
 other exploited reef fishes in this region which have similar pre-settlement durations (&#8805; 2
 weeks). Scales of genetic homogeneity may not reflect demographically relevant dispersal
 distances. However, it does imply that populations of P. microlepis and G. tricuspidata are
 well connected from an evolutionary perspective and have large effective population sizes.
 This reduces the genetic risks associated with natural or anthropogenic declines in local
 populations. Furthermore, genetic diversity across spatial scales &#8804; 400 km could be
 conserved within small MPAs as 99-100% of the total genetic variation for both species
 was represented within 1-2 km of reef. Future studies using genetics to determine
 population connectivity of reef fishes in central NSW should focus on species with very low
 dispersal capabilities, small population sizes, short life spans, and whose habitats are rare or
 patchily distributed along-shore.
 
 The use of otolith chemistry as a natural tag requires the presence of differences in the
 aquatic environment that translate into differences in otolith chemistry. Consequently, most
 studies focus on populations distributed across large environmental gradients and spatial
 scales. This study examined spatial variation in otolith chemistry of the territorial
 damselfish P. microlepis at fine spatial scales in an exclusively marine environment.
 Solution-based inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry was used to measure the
 integrated otolith chemistry of individual fish, reflective of average environmental
 differences among regions (separated by 70-80 km), locations within regions (separated by
 10-50 km), and between sites within locations (separated by 1-2 km). Mean concentrations
 of Sr/Ca, Ba/Ca, Mg/Ca, Mn/Ca, Cu/Ca, and Zn/Ca and multi-element signatures varied
 among regions, locations and sites. Fine scale differences accounted for the majority of the
 variability in the data and there was a trend for unique chemistries at some sites and
 locations. Multi-element signatures were good spatial discriminators, with 75-80% of fish
 correctly classified to the regions in which they were collected. It was difficult to establish
 simple causal relationships for variation in individual elements. However, regional multielement
 signatures were highly correlated with the behaviour of the EAC which delivers
 water masses varying in chemistry, temperature and salinity to the different regions. Results
 demonstrate that the magnitude of environmental variability within open coastal regions
 such as central NSW facilitates the use of otolith chemistry for determining population
 connectivity of reef fishes at scales &lt; 100's km.
 
 The thesis provides clear implications for management of reef fishes in central NSW,
 testable hypotheses, and priorities for future research. Overall results demonstrate the
 ecological value of small MPAs for protecting reef fishes of varying mobility, as well as
 population genetic diversity representative of broader-spatial scales. The determination of
 scales of 'spillover' of eggs, larvae and adults remains the greatest challenge. This study
 suggests that levels of gene flow will limit the utility of microsatellite markers for providing
 information on population connectivity for most reef fishes in central NSW. Given this, a
 combination of otolith chemistry, artificial tags, and modelling are the most promising
 techniques for future studies. Such studies should focus on species which demonstrated
 localised responses to MPA (e.g. C. fuscus, G. tricuspidata, and A. australis).

The influence of river waters and plume driven nutrients and sediments into nearshore systems is also documented. Known changes in the Great Barrier Reef and associated Queensland catchments, including land use change, river water quality, flood plume extent and variation, coral cover, coral reef processes and any related changes are presented.
 
 This research spans a number of large, long term data sets collected over the last 10 years, including long term chlorophyll a data set, and flood plume extents and water quality concentrations both in plumes and around inshore coral reefs. Modelling of all this data demonstrates that the inshore reef of the GBR is becoming more productive, with assessment of risk being highest for the inshore reefs adjacent to the Wet Tropics catchments.
 
 This thesis outlines the potential changes in the nutrient availability by summarising a long term data set of chlorophyll a. The data collected in the seven years demonstrate persistent cross-shelf and regional differences in chlorophyll concentration. Seasonal trends are generally consistent between regions. There are pronounced gradients between inshore and offshore sites, indicating a strong terrestrial influence in the inshore lagoon of the GBR. Results from chlorophyll monitoring support the idea of an inner-shelf polluted zone adjacent to the developed catchments from Port Douglas to Harvey Bay (end of southern region), and relatively unpolluted zone on the inner-shelf north of Port Douglas and generally on the middle and outer shelf. The middle shelf between Cape Grafton and Cape Tribulation (central region) is also somewhat polluted due to its proximity to the coast and polluted rivers. In general, Coral Sea and outer shelf mean chlorophyll concentrations are close to 0.2 &#956;g/L, areas of the GBR Lagoon without polluted river influence have mean concentrations near 0.3 &#956;g/L, long-term mean concentrations in areas subjected to polluted river influence are near 0.6 &#956;g/L while event concentrations in waters affected by flood plumes from polluted rivers are near 3 &#956;g/L.
 
 This larger part of this body of work has looked at the dispersal and extent of flood plumes, the importance of flood plumes as a source of nutrients and sediments and the potential risk of riverine influence on the nearshore ecosystems of the GBR. Through the course of this work, I have monitored and measured flood plumes associated with cyclones from 1991 to 2000. The sampling events were Cyclone Joy (1991), Sadie (1994), Violet (1995), Ethel (1996), Justin (1997), Sid (1998), Rona (1999) and Steve (2000).
 
 Plume distributions presented in chapter 4 establish that the main driving influence on plume dispersal is the direction and strength of wind and discharge volume of the river. Wind conditions are dominated by south-easterly winds which drive the plume north and towards the coast. The greater number of plumes mapped over this study (Violet, Ethel, Justin, Sid and Rona) were restricted to a shallow nearshore northward band by stronger south-easterly winds following the cyclone. However, under relatively calm conditions such as those following Sadie, light offshore winds allowed the plume to disperse seaward and north over much of the shelf and there was a short period of direct impingement upon mid and outer-shelf reefs. The flood plumes associated with Cyclone Joy in the Fitzroy River also moved offshore, following light northerly winds, eventually impinging on reefs of the Capricorn-Bunker group.
 
 The amount of rainfall that falls over a particular catchment can have a marked effect on distribution of the plume. Another factor in the distribution of flood plumes is the influence of headlands on the movement of the plumes (&#8216;steering&#8217;). This can be observed most clearly in the vicinity of Cape Grafton (slightly south-east of Cairns) in extent of the Sadie, Violet and Ethel plumes where northward moving plumes are steered across the Green Island Reef. Green Island Reef appears to the one mid-shelf reef of the GBR, south of the Daintree, which is regularly covered by river plume water. Therefore the assessment of plumes impacting on the mid-shelf reefs adjacent to the Barron River (Green Island) are expected to be underestimates due to effects from other river systems to the south &#8220;steering&#8221; past Cape Grafton.
 
 Data presented in chapter 5 demonstrates that the composition of plumes is strongly dependent on particular events, between days and through a single event, depths and catchment. Timing of sampling is critical in obtaining reliable estimates of material exported in the flood plumes. There is a hysteresis in the development of a flood plume, which is related to catchment characteristics (size, vegetation cover and gradient), rainfall intensity and duration and distribution of flow volume. The time lag difference is significant in the smaller Wet Tropic rivers (Herbert to Daintree) compared to larger Dry Tropic Rivers of the Burdekin and Fitzroy.
 
 Measurements of all parameters taken further away from the river are influenced by physical and biological processes occurring over time as the elevated concentrations in the river water mixed with the lagoonal waters of the GBR. Concentrations on NOx and DIP ranged from 10-15&#956;M and 0.2-0.5&#956;M at sites close to the river mouth and declining to levels between 0-2&#956;M (NOx) and 0 &#8211; 0.2&#956;M at higher salinity concentrations. Though these later concentrations are still high in comparison to baseline concentrations they do reflect influences by other processes. The distribution of nutrients within the plume is a function of riverine inputs, mixing and biological activity which add or remove nutrients. 
 
 Modelling of the plumes associated with specific weather conditions has demonstrated that inshore reef areas adjacent to the Wet Tropics Catchment (between Townsville and Cooktown) regularly experience extreme conditions associated with plumes. Inshore areas (north of the Burdekin and Fitzroy Rivers) receive riverine waters on a less frequent basis. Spatial distribution of the frequency of plume coverage delineates the inshore area of the GBR, which is annually inundated by flood plume waters. Chapter 4 presents a summary of the frequency and distribution of the all flood plumes mapped in the GBR over the last 10 years. 
 
 As part of the assessment of the impact of flood plumes on GBR ecosystems, an estimate is required of the areal and volumetric extent of plumes emanating from the rivers draining to the GBR. The observed distribution of flood plumes between 1994 and 1999 serves as a baseline for evaluating baseline distribution with respect to variables controlling plume extent. Based on these observations, a summary of plume distribution for waters discharging in the vicinity of the Russell-Mulgrave and Barron Rivers has been developed with six qualitative fields of plume distribution (inner1, inner2, inner-mid, mid, mid-outer and outer). A model was developed to estimate the expected distribution of a plume using variables which include wind speed and direction coupled with river flow data. Formulation of expected plume distribution over a longer time period than individual observations allows for the identification of reefs that are subject to plumes and an estimate as to the frequency of impact. Based on the model an estimate of spatial extents of plumes has been made using the Barron River as a case study. The hindcasted model provided a preliminary estimate of how frequently plumes extend to a particular area of the GBR. Based on the data for the Barron River it is estimated that in the past 58 years, a plume may have reached the mid-shelf reefs (outer category) on 18 occasions.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2015/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2015/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of soil amendments on selected properties of tea soils and tea plants (Camellia sinensis L.) in Australia and Sri Lanka</field><field name="creator">De Silva, Meragalge Swarna Damayanthi Luxmei</field><field name="description">Organic matter transformations and nutrient cycling in soils depend on the activity of soil
 organisms. Deterioration of soil fertility lowers the biological activity and results in lower
 productivity. In the absence of adequate organic matter, the processes of conversion of nutrients
 to plant-available forms and their retention are very low. To enhance the activity of soil
 organisms especially that of beneficial microbial populations, the addition of high quality
 organic amendments is very important. Even though there are plenty of organic materials
 available in tea lands, there is inadequate information on their suitability and influence on the
 biological properties of soils.
 
 The present research has attempted to determine the extent to which the microbial activity and
 productivity of tea soils in Australia and Sri Lanka can be manipulated by use of readily
 available soil amendments. Trials were conducted using grass and leguminous mulching
 materials with different C/N ratios, in combination with two pH amendments (dolomite and
 &#8216;MinplusTM&#8217; &#8211; a finely ground volcanic rock dust - both applied at rates of 2500 kg ha-1 only for
 the pot trials and 1000 kg ha-1 for the other trials) and an inoculum of biologically active rain
 forest soil. The nursery stage of tea (Camellia sinensis) propagation was studied in a
 shadehouse at James Cook University, Townsville, Australia, and young tea (unpruned, 1 year
 after planting) and mature tea (pruned bushes, 5 years since planting) were studied in a field in
 Sri Lanka.
 
 In the nursery trial, mulching materials consisting of finely chopped Brachiaria decumbens (a
 grass), Calliandra calothyrsus (a legume), and tea prunings were applied at a rate of 35 tonnes
 fresh weight ha-1 year-1 to pots with or without tea seedlings.
 
 The grass mulch with Minplus improved soil organic carbon, CEC, soil pH, microbial biomass
 carbon, plant available phosphorus, and total nitrogen contents of the soil and enhanced the
 growth of plants when compared to the effects of Calliandra legume and tea mulch. All the
 combinations of mulches with dolomite reduced plant growth even though they enhanced some
 soil properties. Application of grass and legume mulches increased the beneficial population of
 gram positive bacteria, fungi, and mycorrhiza. Grass mulch also improved the growth of tea as
 measured by shoot weight and total biomass. The addition of a rainforest inoculum to the
 soils of the nursery tea plants increased the soil microbial biomass carbon and growth of tea
 plants even in the absence of any mulch.
 
 The field trials in Sri Lanka demonstrated the extent of the changes induced by mulches and
 soil pH modifiers in soil microbial properties, including the abundances of functional groups of
 microbes (bacteria, fungi, mycorrhizae), soil microbial biomass carbon, and microbial
 respiration. In addition organic carbon, soil pH, nitrogen and mulch decomposition rate were
 measured. The mulching materials tested were: refuse tea (25 tonnes ha-1 year-1), Mana grass
 (Cymbopogon confertiflora), and branches of Dadap (Erythrina lithosperma), a leguminous tree
 (35 tonnes fresh weight ha-1 year-1). In addition to these treatments, lemon grass (Cymbopogan
 nardus) 20,000 plants ha-1 as live mulch in young tea and a Trichoderma fungal culture in the
 mature tea were used. For young tea and mature tea, Mana and Dadap were applied four times
 and Refuse tea three times per study period and the lemon grass was planted at the start of the
 trial on a 15 x 15 cm spacing in the young tea; Trichoderma was applied once to the mature tea
 trial at a rate of 500 g of spore culture / plant.
 
 The results indicated that Dadap and Refuse tea raised the yield of tea significantly by 16% and
 19% respectively in young tea, and by 14% in mature tea for both mulches. The mulches
 enhanced soil pH, microbial biomass carbon, soil respiration and also suppressed the most
 detrimental gram negative bacterial populations one year after the application of treatments in
 young tea and increased soil nitrogen by refuse tea in mature tea trial. The quality of tea
 increased in tea grown under the control and lemon grass mulch treatment in young tea and in
 Trichoderma fungus-treated plots in mature tea.
 
 Minplus rock dust and the rainforest soil inoculum enhanced the growth of the nursery plants.
 The most suitable mulching materials to accelerate the biological activity were found to be
 those with C/N ratios below 20, and low in lignin and unoxidisable polyphenol. Therefore, the
 suitable materials for use as mulches on tea lands are Brachiaria grass, refuse tea, and Dadap
 legume. They also suppressed the development of pathogenic bacterial populations particularly
 gram negative bacteria. These materials also improved the biological properties of soil and
 thereby enhanced the growth and yield of tea.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2016/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2016/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Specialist accommodation operations in North Queensland: environmental management, environmental attitudes and ecological sustainability</field><field name="creator">Carmody, Julie Anne</field><field name="description">Specialist accommodation operations are a rapidly expanding nature-based accommodation
 sector contributing to the expansion of tourism in regional and rural areas near protected
 areas in Australia. Specialist accommodation operations are characterised by being owner operated
 accommodation styles having a small room capacity, a high host-guest interaction,
 the location, features or services of the establishment provide a special opportunity for
 guests, and there are special activities offered to guests. The styles of accommodation
 included in the study were bed and breakfasts, farm stays, cabins, cottages, houseboats,
 licensed public hotels, backpacker hostels, ecolodges, retreats and spas, and guest houses.
 This thesis examines the implementation of environmental management practices and the
 environmental attitudes held by the owners of specialist accommodation establishments
 neighbouring or located within 50 kilometres of the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area in
 North Queensland. The study provides an understanding of how specialist accommodation
 operators located near protected areas contribute to the ecological sustainability of the
 natural environment.
 
 A total of 101 specialist accommodation operators located on the Atherton Tablelands
 (n=50), in the Daintree region (n=32) and the Mission Beach region (n=19), completed a
 purposely designed postal survey investigating the characteristics of the accommodation
 business, demographic information about the owner-operators, perceptions of
 environmental certification and codes-of-conduct, the implementation of 43 environmental
 management practices for water conservation, energy conservation, liquid and solid waste
 management, sustainable design and other sustainable practices, and the environmental
 attitudes of the owner-operators were measured with the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP)
 (Dunlap, Mertig, O'Leary &amp; Jones, 2000). Semi-structured interviews were held with 30 of
 the specialist accommodation operators in the sample, seven local Shire Council town
 planners and the Wet Tropics Management Authority. A brief one-page survey emailed or
 posted to tourism and accommodation associations asking of environmental policies and
 codes for members was returned by 14 associations.
 
 All of the specialist accommodation operators surveyed are located within 50 kilometres of
 a protected area and 30.0% are neighbouring a protected area, mostly the WTWHA. Bed
 and breakfasts, cabins, cottages and caravan parks made up more than 60.0% of the sample.
 The mean number of rooms for an establishment is 5.8. Specialist accommodation
 operators are predominantly husband and wife teams aged over 40 years with tertiary or
 trade qualifications. More than 70.0% of these people have operated their specialist
 accommodation for less than eight years. The most dominant reason for operating a
 specialist accommodation is for a change of lifestyle. Approximately 95.0% of the
 operators are members of a tourism or accommodation association.
 
 Environmental management practices readily adopted by specialist accommodation
 operations are dual flush toilets, purchasing local goods and services, bulk purchasing
 practices, the use of bio-degradable cleaning products, the use of ceiling fans not air
 conditioning, and the sustainable design techniques of maximizing natural ventilation and
 natural light, and their landscaping reflecting the natural environment. The implementation
 of alternative sustainable environmental management practices using wind, solar or water
 are minimal. Almost all of the operators had a personal concern for the environment with
 more than 50.0% of operators stating this was their reason for voluntarily adopting an
 environmental code-of-conduct; others followed a code for better environmental
 management. The achievement of environmental certification with Ecotourism Australia,
 Green Globe or AAA Tourism Green STARS is minor with most specialist accommodation
 operators believing certification is beneficial to their business or will benefit their
 marketing activities.
 
 The New Ecological Paradigm showed operators are generally pro-environmental holding
 an ecological worldview to varying degrees. Three factor groups were found to exist &#8211;
 those who co-exist with nature, anthropocentrics and pro-environmentalists. Correlates of
 environmental concern indicators were found to be either non-existent, statistically
 insignificant or empirically weak. To understand the correlation between an owner operator's
 environmental attitudes and an individual&#8217;s intention to behave environmentally, the Framework of Environmental Behaviour recognises situational, psychological and
 demographic factors which affect an individual&#8217;s environmental behaviour intention.
 Barriers to implementing environmental management techniques included location,
 climate, knowledge, cost, time and the style of specialist accommodation.
 
 Regulatory bodies interacting with the specialist accommodation sector in this study were
 the seven local Shire councils of Atherton, Mareeba, Eacham, Herberton, Douglas,
 Johnstone and Cardwell, the Wet Tropics Management Authority and 14 tourism and
 accommodation associations. In essence, research of the regulatory agencies focused on
 the existence of environmental policies, codes-of-conduct and guidelines for the specialist
 accommodation operators located near protected areas. Shire council planning schemes
 have the opportunity to provide advice on environmental best practice to new development
 applications assessed under recent relevant codes. There is no mechanism to encourage
 environmental best practice management to existing specialist accommodation operations.
 The Wet Tropics Management Authority recognises a cooperative approach between
 stakeholders of the Wet Tropics is imperative for the future sustainability of this world
 heritage listed bioregion. The benefits of working with the community have been
 previously recognised by WTMA with the encouragement of a landholders/ neighbours
 liaison group. WTMA also encourage and promote voluntary conservation agreements
 with private landowners within the Wet Tropics region particularly where cassowary
 habitat corridors are located. The most dominant purpose of tourism and accommodation
 associations is collective marketing. Environmental codes-of-conduct, recommendations
 for environmental best practice or environmental awards to encourage best practice
 techniques for their members is minimal.
 
 This discussion of the study findings has provided further support to the proposition that
 specialist accommodation operations are more conscious of, and compatible with, the
 principles of ecologically sustainable tourism than traditional accommodation (Morrison et
 al., 1996). A personal concern for the environment was apparent and widespread. The
 majority of specialist accommodation operators are aware of the importance of their environmental actions and the consequences of improper environmental management.
 There are internal and external factors impeding the implementation of some environmental
 management practices.
 
 This study has provided an initial understanding of the specialist accommodation sector and
 their contribution to the future preservation of protected areas. Knowledge transfer is
 imperative for the future ecological sustainability of tourism operations located near or
 neighbouring protected areas in North Queensland. The results have proven specialist
 accommodation owner-operators are contributing to the protection and management of
 protected areas with ecological significance through a personal concern for the
 environment, the implementation of sustainable environmental management practices and
 principles, and guest education initiatives, all to the best of their knowledge and abilities.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2017/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2017/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of coral degradation on tropical fish community structure</field><field name="creator">Feary, David A.</field><field name="description">Coral reefs harbour a spectacular diversity of fishes that derive food and shelter from the habitat provided by living corals. Unfortunately, both natural and anthropogenic disturbances are intensifying the global alteration and loss of live coral cover. The likely impacts of this loss on reef associated fish communities have yet to be fully assessed. The broad aim of this thesis was to examine the processes and mechanisms underlying the effects of live coral reductions on coral-associated reef fish communities. A combination of surveys and experimental manipulations were used to explore this relationship for both the fish community as a whole, and key components that represented species with differing associations with live coral.
 
 To examine the role of coral disturbance in structuring diverse coral reef fish communities, I surveyed and compared assemblages associated with 2 coral species (Seriatopora hystrix and Pocillopora damicornis) in 3 health states (live, degraded and dead colonies with algal cover) (Chapter 2). This study showed that despite differences in the structure of assemblages associated with live and degraded colonies between coral species, there were similar patterns in reef fish community change with coral death. Assemblages associated with dead, algal-covered colonies of both coral species held virtually no coral obligates, while coral-specific differences in obligate abundance were apparent between live and degraded colonies. There was a shift in the diversity of reef fish communities between health states, within both coral species. Live and degraded colonies were numerically dominated by coral-associated fishes while dead, algal-covered colonies were numerically dominated by fishes closely associated with non live-coral habitats. The total abundance of species was lowest in algal-covered colonies of both coral species, largely due to the low number of small size classes (new recruits and juveniles) associated with the habitat. Overall, this study has shown that coral health will play a substantial role in structuring reef associated fish assemblages, though the effects of coral loss on fish communities will be dependent on coral species and the taxonomic and functional composition of its associated fish assemblage 
 
 Within Chapter 2 I found that dead, algal-covered colonies held substantially lower abundances of fishes in small size classes (i.e. new settlers and recruits) than live or degraded colonies. Historically, disparity in coral reef fish community composition has been attributed to ecological factors affecting patterns of reef fish larval settlement. However, the mechanisms that determine how new settlers will respond to coral stress and the repercussions of coral loss in structuring reef fish communities are poorly understood. In Chapter 3, therefore, I examined the role of coral degradation in structuring patterns of coral reef fish settlement. Within aquaria choice experiments, reef associated damselfishes (both coral and non-coral associated) avoided dead, algal-covered colonies, preferentially settling into either live or partially degraded colonies. Using a habitat-limited recruitment model, such avoidance of algal-covered habitats at settlement was predicted to substantially alter patterns of reef fish settlement. I hypothesised that settlement of coral-associated fishes would become habitat-limited within degraded reef landscapes, with new settlers unable to find suitable settlement habitat. Consequently, an extensive field experiment showed that live coral colonies formed important settlement substratum for a range of reef associated fishes. In situ experimental live coral degradation on small coral colonies led to rapid reductions in the abundance of coral-associated fishes settling into the colonies (2 - 4 weeks after disturbance), replaced by extremely low abundances of species closely associated with the algal biomass. From these experiments, I argued that the abundance and diversity of new settlers apparent within coral habitats would reflect the health of the ecosystem; live coral alteration and loss leading to reduced new settler abundance and a phase shift in new settler diversity within the degraded habitat. 
 
 The response of reef fish communities to coral degradation and algal overgrowth was species and functional group specific (Chapter 2). However, there were higher than expected levels of resistance to coral degradation within a range of coral-associated fishes (Chapter 2). Applying terrestrial-based theory, I hypothesised that such differences in resistance were potentially influenced by species habitat specialisation (Chapter 4). Habitat specialists were more likely to remain within degraded coral colonies than generalists, due to their lowered ability to successfully migrate between habitats. Within Chapter 4, I compared the resistance and migration ability of both habitat generalist and specialist coral-dwelling goby species (Gobiidae). At low levels of coral loss specialists exhibited a higher propensity to remain in colonies than generalists, though there was no difference in resistance at both medium and high levels of coral loss. Over the majority of distances examined, specialists also showed substantially lower levels of successful migration. These results suggest that specialists are more likely to become isolated in degraded habitats than generalists, increasing the probability of their decline with habitat degradation. I argue that if this pattern holds true for the array of coral-associated reef fish species, such disparity in response to live coral disturbance between specialists and generalists may result in disproportionate reductions in the population abundance of habitat specialists in degraded habitats. 
 
 Although species-specific differences in live coral dependence were likely to influence how fish assemblages responded to live coral loss, within Chapter 2 I showed that the abundance of a diverse range of coral-associated fishes were not substantially lower in degraded than live coral colonies. Recent evidence suggested that even with no observable change in abundance, however, reduced resource availability in degraded habitats may have negative effects on resident fishes physiological condition. Therefore, within Chapter 5, I compared the growth, condition and persistence of 2 planktivorous damselfish species (Pomacentridae) over 29 days, translocated onto coral colonies in 3 experimental treatments: live, partially and fully degraded colonies. This research showed that both species growth rates were directly related to live coral cover; populations associated with fully degraded colonies showed the lowest growth while those associated with live colonies the highest. There was no significant change in the condition or persistence of populations, between treatments. These results suggested that the short-term response of coral-associated reef fishes to low live coral were reductions in growth rather than condition or absolute abundance. I argued that such bottlenecks in the growth rate of fish species associated with degraded habitats may negatively influence their time to maturity, fitness and lifetime fecundity. 
 
 The results of this thesis have fundamental implications in understanding the response of coral reef fish communities to increasing levels of live coral degradation. Fluctuations in species replenishment, differences in the resistance of individuals dependent on their habitat specialisation, and reductions in the growth of individuals remaining in degraded habitats will significantly affect the structure of the reef associated fish community within degraded reef systems. Ultimately, the alteration and loss of the living coral tissue will play a substantial role in structuring tropical reef fish community structure.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2021/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2021/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Habitat relationships, activity patterns and feeding ecology of insectivorous bats of the Top End of Australia</field><field name="creator">Milne, Damian John</field><field name="description">The wet-dry tropics of the Northern Territory (the Top End) has a diverse microbat
 fauna. It supports 28 of Australia&#8217;s 65 species, including one endemic species
 (Taphozous kapalgensis), both of Australia&#8217;s monotypic genera (Rhinonicteris and
 Macroderma) and two species considered to be rare or endangered (Saccolaimus
 saccolaimus and Hipposideros diadema). However, most aspects of the ecology of this
 fauna are poorly known. The aim of this study was to investigate the composition of
 microbat assemblages; describe the habitat relationships of the microbat fauna at both
 the community and species levels; assess microbat activity patterns at several temporal
 scales; and to conduct a dietary analysis of the microbats of the Top End.
 Robust methods for sampling bats are still being developed and tested. Based on
 recordings derived from the Anabat II detector, I compared the results of surveys where
 I changed the orientation of the detector, the type of recording media, and static versus
 active hand-held recording. Detector orientation did not significantly affect any survey
 results, more call passes were identified from digital recordings and more species were
 detected using hand-held recordings. I also derived species-accumulation curves for the
 Top End microbats and provide guidelines for minimum sampling effort in future
 studies.
 
 Patterns in the composition of assemblages of microbat species sampled during the late
 dry season (the &#8216;build-up&#8217;) in the Top End were assessed against a range of
 environmental factors as well as four a priori defined habitat types (riparian,
 escarpments, coastal and woodlands). In general, species assemblages were not clearly
 defined and the number of significant environmental associations was relatively few.
 The most distinct species assemblages were strongly associated with topographic and
 climatic variables. There were also limited associations with vegetation structure, fire
 and local roost potential but no associations with insects or water availability. Total
 species diversity at sample sites was associated with distance to rivers and rainfall.
 Generalised linear modelling (GLM) was used to develop habitat models for 25 of the
 28 microbat species of the Top End. Based on these models, a geographic information
 system (GIS) was used to derive probability of occurrence maps for each species.
 Almost all of the models identified a unique combination of environmental variables,
 and the resulting probability of occurrence maps revealed a variety of patterns of
 predicted distribution. Annual rainfall and habitat complexity were identified as
 significant variables in the majority of the models. All of the spatial models were
 combined to derive a probability map of species richness of microchiropteran bats in the
 Top End. This map shows greatest species richness in the north-west and north-central
 parts of the study area.
 
 Temporal patterns of microbat activity and species richness were assessed at four scales:
 hourly, nightly, monthly and yearly, in relation to biotic (insect availability) and abiotic
 features in the environment. At the hourly scale, bat activity was highest in the first hour
 after dusk and declined throughout the night. Hourly bat activity was most closely
 associated with temperature. At the nightly scale there were significant associations
 between bat activity, moon light and temperature as well as a complex association with
 both moon phase and time of night. At the monthly scale bat activity increased
 dramatically in October which was possibly triggered by a combination of changing
 climatic factors that occur at this time of year in the Top End. At the yearly scale there
 was no overall difference in bat activity between years (n = 4) and no associations with
 climatic variables.
 
 The dietary composition for 23 of the 28 Top End microbat species was described by
 identifying the prey remains collected from stomachs and faecal pellets to the lowest
 possible taxonomic level (usually order or lower). Dietary analysis revealed that most
 species consumed a variety of orders indicating that Top End microbats have generalist
 dietary requirements and/or opportunistic foraging habits. However, the dietary
 compositions for H. diadema, H. stenotis, Mormopterus loriae, Nyctophilus geoffroyi,
 N. bifax and T. kapalgensis contained only one or two insect orders suggesting these
 species may have more specialised diets. Microbats in the &#8216;Uncluttered&#8217; foraging guild
 consumed proportionally more insects belonging to the orders Orthoptera and
 Coleoptera whereas the &#8216;Background clutter&#8217; and &#8216;Highly cluttered&#8217; foraging guilds
 consumed proportionally more Lepidoptera.
 
 This study has greatly increased our understanding of some aspects of the ecology of
 microbats in the Australian wet-dry tropics. I make a number of recommendations for
 the conservation management and future research of Top End microbat fauna, most
 notably to investigate the association between microbat diversity and riparian areas,
 conduct further microbat surveys throughout the region to redress the still meagre
 number of records, and initiate targeted monitoring programs for microbats.

(fighting order over disorder): an analysis of food and its significance in the Australian novels of Christina Stead, Patrick White and Thea Astley</field><field name="creator">Frugtneit, Jane</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to find a correlation between food as symbol and food as necessity, as represented in selected Australian novels by Christina Stead, Patrick White and Thea Astley. Food as a springboard to a unique interpretation of the selected novels has been under-utilised in academic research. Although comparatively few novels were selected for study, on the basis of fastidiousness, they facilitated a rigorous hermeneutical approach to the interpretation of food and its inherent symbolism. The principle behind the selection of these novels lies in the complexity of the prose and how that complexity elicits the &#8220;transformative powers of food&#8221; (Muncaster 1996, 31). The thesis examines both the literal and metaphorical representations of food in the novels and relates how food is an inextricable part of ALL aspects of life, both actual and fictional. Food sustains, nourishes and, intellectually, its many components offer unique interpretative tools for textual analysis.
 
 Indeed, the overarching structure of the thesis is analogous with the processes of eating, digestion and defecation. For example, following a discussion of the inextricable link between food, quest and freedom in Chapter One, which uncovers contrary attitudes towards food in the novels discussed, the thesis presents a more complex psychoanalytic theory of mental disorders related to food in Chapter Two. The peripatetic nature of the mind and body and how this relates to food are reflected in the following chapter, which considers the nexus between dietetics, numerology and lexicology. A unique methodology is promulgated to examine how binaries such as black/white, reality/illusion and day/night are constructed, and how these relate to the significance of food in colonisation fiction. The final chapter relocates food to the corporeal through an examination of food in art and considers how this representation relates to defecation. Ultimately, the argument underscores the significance of food in literature, by showing that in their many facets references to food are a multi-interpretative tool for producing an aetiological and phenomenological discussion. To conclude, food is from somewhere, it is a commodity, and in literature food is going somewhere.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2022/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2022/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Food safety and security of sago starch in rural Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Greenhill, Andrew R.</field><field name="description">Sago starch is an important source of dietary carbohydrate in lowland and coastal
 areas of Papua New Guinea (PNG). There have been sporadic reports of severe
 haemolytic illness resulting from sago starch consumption, termed sago haemolytic
 disease (SHD), with most reports coming from the Western Province. Despite the
 occurrence of SHD, and a high likelihood of less severe foodborne illness resulting
 from consumption of indigenous foods in general in PNG, there have been no
 detailed studies of the microbiology of sago starch. The aim of this study was to
 establish a broad basal knowledge of the microbiology of traditionally prepared sago
 starch in PNG.
 
 Sago starch samples and sociological information were collected in two of the main
 sago eating regions of PNG, the East Sepik Province and the Western Province.
 Sago starch samples were collected predominantly from the houses of sago starch
 producers in rural areas of the two provinces, and to a lesser degree from markets in
 some villages in the East Sepik Province. In addition to these samples considered &#8216;fit
 for consumption&#8217;, two samples of sago starch that had been associated with
 outbreaks of SHD were also analysed.
 
 Analysis of the sago starch for common bacterial pathogens was done using accepted
 methods, and where possible was based on the relevant Australian Standards. The
 findings suggest that faecal contamination of sago starch is widespread, with over
 three-quarters of all samples tested for faecal coliforms at the upper limit of
 detection. The human pathogen Salmonella spp. was isolated from approximately 7%
 of samples tested. The presence of emerging human pathogens such as Citrobacter
 freundii and Enterobacter sakazakii was tested, with the former being present in a
 low percentage of samples tested. Other important bacterial food pathogens such as
 Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus were also detected in sago starch, but
 none of the 57 samples tested for Listeria monocytogenes was positive.
 
 Mycological analysis of sago starch revealed a variety of fungal contaminants.
 Commonly occurring genera of filamentous fungi included Penicillium, Scytalidium,
 Aspergillus, and Acremonium. Mycotoxin analysis of sago starch revealed that the common mycotoxins such as aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, cyclopiazonic acid,
 sterigmatocystin, zearalenone and citrinin were not present. Selected fungal isolates
 were tested for the presence of mycotoxin production in pure culture, with two-thirds
 found to be capable of citrinin production and one isolate capable of sterigmatocystin
 synthesis.
 
 In an attempt to determine the aetiological agent of SHD, bacterial and fungal
 isolates were screened for haemolytic activity on blood agar. A suitable semiquantitative
 assay was developed, and extracts from bacterial and fungal cultures
 were tested. Particular attention was paid to the haemolytic activity of fungal
 extracts, given the long speculated role of mycotoxins in the aetiology of SHD. The
 haemolytic activity of numerous fungal species has been demonstrated for the first
 time, and steps in the optimised extraction and purification of the haemolytic
 component of some isolates has been completed. Further work was conducted on
 extracts from Penicillium steckii, a common contaminant of sago starch. The
 chemical properties of the extract suggest that a novel fungal metabolite is
 responsible for haemolytic activity.
 
 Detailed studies on the microbial ecology of stored sago starch have been conducted,
 primarily to garner a greater understanding of factors that contribute to the microbial
 safety of the food. The study has established that sago starch is a naturally fermented
 product, and this fermentation process contributes greatly to the food safety of the
 product. Bacterial pathogens such as B. cereus, L. monocytogenes, S. aureus and
 Salmonella sp. do not survive well in actively fermenting sago starch, primarily due
 to the production of weak acids. Furthermore, numbers of filamentous fungi are low
 in actively fermenting sago starch, presumably due to the reduced oxygen
 availability.
 
 On the basis of the sociological data and microbial studies, a hazard analysis and
 critical control point (HACCP) plan was devised that was considered appropriate for
 application in village based production of sago starch in rural PNG. Through a
 greater understanding of the microbiology of sago starch, together with the
 development of an appropriate HACCP plan, this research will lead to increased food
 safety and food security for sago consumers in rural and remote lowland areas of PNG. Moreover, studies of the haemolytic metabolites of fungi isolated from sago
 starch pave the way for further research to determine the aetiology of SHD.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2023/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2023/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design and implementation of HTS technology for cellular base stations: an investigation into improving cellular communication</field><field name="creator">Knack, Adrian</field><field name="description">When placed between the antenna and receiver electronics of a cellular base transceiver station, a
 Cryogenic Receiver Front End (CRFE), consisting of a High Temperature Superconducting (HTS) filter
 and modern Low Noise Amplifier (LNA), can significantly improve the base stations&#8217; coverage and
 capacity. Due to CRFEs being hurried to the telecommunications industry in a competitive market, the
 development of CRFEs and their performance have been classified. This left it to be pondered whether
 HTS filters could really have been beneficial or if they were always just of academic interest. It is the
 main objective of this thesis to investigate if and under what circumstances high temperature RFsuperconductivity
 can prove to be an important technological contribution to current and future
 wireless communications.
 
 This dissertation presents the analysis of an existing CRFE developed by Cryoelectra GmbH and its
 performance characteristics measured in a field trial held in rural China. With the aid of a CDMA Uplink
 Model developed by the author, the data was analysed and several novel engineering improvements were
 made to create an advanced CRFE which was economical to deploy. The analysis of results from a field
 trial in Beijing city using the CDMA Uplink Model led to the exploration of alternative filter technologies
 which could achieve similar results to the HTS filter technology. This culminated in the development of
 dielectric resonators filters which could be used as an alternative and as a supplement to the HTS filters
 used in the CRFE. The design of two novel dielectric resonator duplexers and two advanced multioperator
 combiner antenna sharing solutions followed the successful implementation of a high
 performance dielectric resonator filter.
 
 The performed investigation and development described in this thesis suggest that HTS filter technology
 for terrestrial wireless communications can be beneficial in current cellular networks, but due to its high
 cost is economical for use only under certain conditions. However, HTS filter technology may be of great
 importance in the design and implementation of spectrum friendly wireless communications systems in
 the future.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2025/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2025/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A proposal for a uniform Australian regulatory model</field><field name="creator">Middleton, Thomas H.</field><field name="description">The problem
 The Australian Commonwealth regulators, including the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), are each governed by their own legislation. That legislation provides each of them with their own investigative and enforcement powers and processes. While those powers and processes are directed to assisting them to resolve similar regulatory issues or problems, they are not uniform across the various regulatory laws. Those inconsistencies are partly the product of successive federal governments&#8217; &#8220;ad hoc&#8221; and reactive approach to the development of the regulatory laws. Further, as problems with a particular regulator&#8217;s powers or processes are identified, usually as the result of costly litigation, they are rectified by legislative amendments, but those amendments are not made uniformly or consistently across all regulatory legislation, even though the problems may be universal. This approach has meant that some regulators have superior investigative and enforcement powers in comparison to others. In some cases, the problems are not rectified by express provisions and the matter is governed by common law or equitable principles. Those general law principles do not always provide a clear resolution to the problem either. Those inconsistencies and ambiguities adversely impact on the effectiveness and efficiency of the Australian regulatory framework taken as a whole and therefore impact on the effectiveness and efficiency with which governments, businesses and individuals in the economy can operate.
 
 Thesis statement and objectives
 It is argued in this thesis that there is an unwarranted inconsistency between the regulatory powers and processes applicable to Australia&#8217;s four principal federal regulatory bodies, ASIC, APRA, the ACCC and the ATO, and that this inconsistency impacts negatively on the effectiveness and efficiency with which those bodies can discharge their regulatory functions. It is argued and demonstrated that their effectiveness and efficiency can be improved by standardising the relevant powers and processes through reform of their governing regulatory laws. Such reforms are both desirable and achievable by amending the existing regulatory frameworks and by benchmarking the reforms against best practice as observed both within the existing Australian regulatory frameworks and in comparable foreign regulatory frameworks.
 
 The specific objectives of this thesis are to:
 (a) identify the areas in which the powers and processes of ASIC, APRA, the ACCC and the ATO differ and can be improved through alignment or standardisation;
 (b) investigate and suggest better approaches to regulatory reform;
 (c) identify the ideal reforms that should be incorporated in the Australian statutory regulatory regime; and
 (d) propose a mechanism for the implementation of the identified reforms.
 
 The general overarching objective of this thesis is to demonstrate the desirability of adopting a uniform statutory regulatory model, and to suggest the reforms that should be incorporated into such a model (to balance competing public and private interests) that are suitable for adoption by ASIC, APRA, the ACCC and the ATO. Those reforms will give those regulators, the regulated and the judiciary clear guidance as to the applicable rules and procedures in all regulatory matters, and would promote more timely and cost-effective regulatory outcomes and more effective regulation of the Australian economy.
 
 Methodology
 The problems inherent in the relevant Australian regulatory laws are identified, defined and analysed by comparing the existing Australian regulatory frameworks and the relevant regulatory frameworks in the United States and the United Kingdom. Each of those frameworks will be analysed according to the competing (and sometimes overlapping) public and private interests that underpin them.
 
 The existing regulatory frameworks are also analysed using universal theoretical and practical principles (derived from regulatory theory and judicial and academic writings) including the need to:
 (a) promote more effective regulation;
 (b) promote greater certainty and clarity in the law;
 (c) ensure greater government accountability;
 (d) promote better decision-making;
 (e) save time and costs in regulatory actions; and
 (f) observe the principles of fairness, including the need to treat like cases alike.
 The purpose of the comparative analysis is to identify the &#8220;benchmarks&#8221; of effective regulation, or &#8220;best practice&#8221; in, or the advantageous features of, each regulatory framework, as well as to identify the weaknesses and inconsistencies in those frameworks to provide an informed basis for suggested law reform.
 
 Findings
 The analysis indicates there is a lack of clarity, consistency and uniformity in the Australian regulatory laws. As a consequence, the Australian regulators, the regulated and the judiciary do not have clear guidance in relation to a range of common regulatory issues which, in turn, has resulted in collateral litigation concerning evidential and procedural issues that are unrelated to the substantive merits of the case. The lack of clarity in the law has not promoted better decision-making in regulatory matters because similar regulatory issues have not been resolved on a consistent basis in the context of the different regulators and like cases have not been treated alike. This has negatively impacted on what should be the primary goal of achieving effective regulation because compliance is not being achieved in a timely, cost-effective and efficient manner. Those problems may, in turn, have an adverse impact on Australia&#8217;s economic growth and on the prosperity of all Australians.
 
 Recommendations
 The thesis concludes by recommending that the federal government should adopt a more consistent, informed, principled and proactive approach to the formulation of the Australian regulatory laws. The laws governing the core investigative and enforcement powers of ASIC, APRA, the ACCC and the ATO should be made more consistent or, where practicable, uniform. The suggested reforms can be readily and cost-effectively implemented because they only require the enactment of a small number of uniform Commonwealth laws and the amendment of a small number of existing laws. Many of the suggested reforms could be achieved by enacting the proposed Investigation and Enforcement Powers Act (Cth) and the proposed Administrative Powers and Proceedings Act (Cth) to govern the investigative, enforcement and administrative functions of ASIC, APRA, the ACCC and the ATO and to afford uniform protections to the regulated. This legislation would, at least substantially, eliminate the present confusion and ambiguity in the law and lead to more consistent and effective regulatory outcomes, because the regulators, the judiciary and the regulated would be governed by one set of standards that would be applied consistently to common regulatory problems across all Australian business and financial sectors and regulatory jurisdictions.
 
 The suggested reforms retain the advantages of the current Australian multiple regulator model, including the view that regulators, like ASIC, APRA, the ACCC and the ATO, being bodies that are formed for separate purposes, will function best with their own distinct cultures. The suggested reforms also avoid the potential problems associated with adopting the United Kingdom&#8217;s approach of merging some regulators into one &#8220;super regulator&#8221;, such as producing inefficiencies and exposing the Australian regulatory system to further substantial disruption and cost. The suggested reforms are also consistent with the views expressed in the United States that &#8220;where governmental involvement is needed, its aim should be to support and enforce a predictable, minimalist, consistent and simple legal environment for commerce.&#8221;</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2026/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2026/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sublethal effects of diel fluctuations in dissolved oxygen
 saturation on freshwater fishes from tropical Queensland</field><field name="creator">Flint, Nicole</field><field name="description">The effects of diel fluctuations in DO saturation were investigated for four species of
 tropical freshwater fish at various life history stages. Fluctuating hypoxia was
 achieved by gradually lowering DO saturation to a minimum level (minimum level
 differed between treatments), then allowing DO to return to normoxia each day for the
 duration of experiments. A range of oxygen regimes were tested on juvenile Lates
 calcarifer, Melanotaenia splendida splendida and Hephaestus fuliginosus; adult
 Melanotaenia utcheensis; and embryonic M. s. splendida, M. utcheensis and H.
 fuliginosus. Immediate lethal limits after gradual oxygen reductions were recorded for
 each species/life history stage where possible, as well as various effects on the
 sublethal level, including effects on growth (for juveniles), ventilation (for juveniles),
 reproduction (for adults) and viability (for embryos).
 The four fish species tested were found to be surprisingly tolerant to the oxygen
 regimes they were exposed to during the study. Species/life history stages that are
 frequently exposed to hypoxia in natural situations were found to be the most tolerant
 during experiments. The rank order of resistance of each species/life history stage
 from highest to lowest was: eggs of M. s. splendida and M. utcheensis (no immediate
 lethal level identified), juvenile L. calcarifer (immediate lethal level ~2% DO
 saturation), juvenile M. s. splendida and adult M. utcheensis (immediate lethal level 6-
 7%), and juvenile H. fuliginosus (immediate lethal level ~7%).
 L. calcarifer, M. s. splendida and M. utcheensis were all capable of aquatic surface
 respiration at the juvenile and adult stages tested. Juvenile H. fuliginosus did not
 display this adaptive behaviour. Growth and feeding behaviour of juvenile L.
 calcarifer were affected in treatments reaching 5% and 10% minimum DO saturation
 daily; as was food consumption of some H. fuliginosus individuals in the treatment
 reaching 10% DO saturation daily (5% treatment was lethal for the species).
 Eggs of M. s. splendida and M. utcheensis were completely resistant to the oxygen
 regimes tested, and more tolerant to hypoxia than juvenile and adult stages of the
 same species. Reproduction of surviving adult M. utcheensis was largely unaffected
 by exposure to diel fluctuations in DO saturation, although one of two broodgroups
 treated with a minimum DO saturation of 10% daily ceased egg production after 18
 days of oxygen cycling; and in the same aquarium one of the two female fish was
 found to have a high percentage of atretic (degenerative) eggs in her ovary.
 Although the results suggested that species of fish tested were remarkably tolerant to
 the sublethal DO regimes imposed during the study, some effects on reproduction,
 growth and feeding were apparent and may be much more detrimental in natural
 situations where food must be caught, and mates located. Additionally, longer
 durations of daily minimum DO saturation, or longer duration of the fluctuating
 hypoxia regime may increase effects. The results have implications for water quality
 guidelines for wetlands and waterways of tropical north Queensland, and provide a
 broad baseline for more targeted research into the effects of hypoxia on fish from the
 region.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2027/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2027/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Radiowave propagation measurements and prediction in bushfires</field><field name="creator">MPhale, Kgakgamatso M.</field><field name="description">Australian vegetation is fire-prone. Every year, wet and dry sclerophyll forests of Western
 Australia, southeastern Australia and grassland ecosystems of the northern part of the continent
 are subject to high intensity fires. The sclerophyll vegetation contains up to 2.71 % of the
 element potassium. The element exists in plants&#8217; organic matrix: attached to the oxygen containing and carboxyl functional groups; in aqueous form such as potassium (K+) ions
 surrounded by water; and as discrete particles in dried plant parts. Theoretically, temperature in
 the conflagrations can be as high as 2000&#186;C. During the high intensity bushfires, potassium
 atoms and salts are released from the plant structure as it crumbles into the combustion zone
 where the species are ionized. Up to 20 % of the potassium present in plants is ionized in a
 bushfire environment.
 
 During suppression of the threat, high frequency (HF) - ultra high frequency (UHF) radio
 communications systems are in constant use by suppression crews in firegrounds. Despite their
 use, HF and very high frequency (VHF) radio communications are reported to be failing in
 extreme bushfire conditions. The reports of radio communication failure tend to be anecdotal and
 therefore warrant an investigation. This study aims at carrying out field and laboratory radio wave
 attenuation and phase shift measurements at HF to X-band frequencies in moderate intensity fires.
 Very high intensity bushfires often spread very fast and change direction rapidly therefore it is
 unsafe to set up equipment for measuring attenuation and phase shift in the fires. Consequently,
 numerical experiments were used to study radio wave propagation in very high intensity fires.
 
 Propagation measurement data at radio wave (HF-VHF) frequencies through fire are scarce and
 that which is available lacks precision. It is also the purpose of the study to produce attenuation
 and phase measurement data at these frequencies. The field and laboratory measurements were
 carried out using a Radio Wave Interferometer (RWI) and Vector Network Analyzer (VNA - HP
 8277C). RWI uses the same principles as Microwave interferometer (MWI) except that RWI
 works at radio frequencies. Electron density and momentum transfer collision frequency in
 moderate intensity bushfire plumes were estimated from the attenuation and phase shift
 measurements.
 
 Laboratory and field measurements using a VNA - HP 8277C and RWI respectively in moderate
 intensity fires (700-1000 K) have revealed that electron density in the plume could range from
 1014-1016 m-3. Theoretical calculations based on local thermal equilibrium in grassfires flames
 with temperatures up to 1200 K suggest that electron density could be up to 1017 m-3 if up to 20 %
 of the inherent potassium atoms are ionized.
 
 There are at least two possible mechanisms that could lead to a significant signal strength
 reduction (attenuation) in bushfire environments. They are signal refraction due to thermal bubble
 and ionization-induced signal absorption in the plume. Electrons, which result from thermal
 ionization of potassium in the fire, transfer energy from the incident radio wave to the fire plume
 through collision with inherent neutral particles. The transfer of energy can significantly attenuate
 and induce a phase shift on radio wave signals. Experimental work carried out in the project
 suggest that radio wave attenuation is significantly higher at UHF and X-Band frequencies than at
 HF. Field radio wave propagation measurements at 1.50 m above the seat of a moderate intensity
 grassfire revealed that 30 MHz signals can be attenuated by up to 0.03 dB/m while 151.3 MHz
 signals were attenuated by up to 0.05 dB/m. An intense cane fire attenuated 151.3 MHz signals
 by 0.05 dB/m. The attenuation effect was observed to increase when X-band (10.0 -12.5 GHz)
 signals were considered. Attenuation coefficients up to 4.45 dB/m were measured.
 
 Phase shift induced on the signals was also observed to increase with the increase in frequency
 band (low for HF and high for X-band). A 30 MHz signal suffered a 3.08&#186; phase shift in the
 moderate intensity grassfire whereas in the X-band frequencies, a phase shift of up to 29.31&#186; was
 observed in a fire of about the same intensity.
 
 Numerical experiments have shown that signal loss due to refraction is frequency dependent in
 very hot regions of bushfire plumes. X-band waves are more affected than VHF waves.
 Numerical experiments predicted maximum attenuation coefficients of 0.11 dBm-1 for 150 MHz
 and 0.31 dBm-1 for 3 GHz radio waves when they propagate about a meter above fuel-flame
 interface of a 90 MWm-1 bushfire with fuel potassium content of 0.50 %. Theoretical studies also
 revealed that; for potassium content of about 0.20 %, a collimated beam of radio signals (10 cm
 wide) propagating at grazing angles to the fuel-flame interface of a very high intensity bushfire
 (1600 K) could suffer attenuation coefficients of about 1.45 dBm-1. This effect is calculated to
 decrease with the increase in height above the combustion zone. For very high intensity bushfires
 in fuels with high potassium content (e.g., up to 3.00 %), attenuation by refraction is likely to be
 the most significant form of radio wave energy loss for collimated beams propagating at grazing
 angles to the fuel-flame interface.
 
 The Line-Of-Sight (LOS) radio wave propagation measurements in moderate intensity vegetation
 fires (700-1000 K) have shown that signal attenuation is plume temperature and frequency
 dependent. Transmission through hottest region of the fire (combustion zone) suffers significant
 signal strength loss whereas low attenuation has been observed at cooler regions of the plume.
 This could be explained by the fact that &#8220;collisional plasma effect&#8221; on radio waves is more
 pronounced at combustion zone than at the thermal plume region of the fire as the effect is
 temperature dependent.
 
 Bcontinent with a potential combustion zone temperature of 2000&#186;C. These bushfires have a
 potential to adversely affect LOS radio wave communications when transmission is through the
 hottest part of the fire. It must be noted that radio wave communication blackout could even
 occur at temperatures as low as 1300 K provided that the fire is sufficiently ionized.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2028/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2028/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neo counter-insurgency: Vietnam redux?</field><field name="creator">Orr, Allan</field><field name="description">This thesis argues that current counter-insurgency doctrine, theory and practice as employed by the militaries of the Coalition (America, Australia and Britain) overlooks critical relationships between counter-insurgency variables in the conflicts of Afghanistan and Iraq.

 better understanding their life histories and potential vulnerability to fishing or other threats.
 The focus of this research was comparative age-based demographics of tropical epinepheline
 serranids (or groupers) from two geographic areas: Australia&#8217;s Great Barrier Reef (GBR) in
 the western Pacific; and the Seychelles Islands in the western Indian Ocean. The overall aim
 was to investigate age-based demographics and assemblage structure of tropical epinepheline
 serranids at multiple scales.
 
 The epinepheline fauna in the study areas was partitioned for some analyses into three
 behavioural groupings based on foraging pattern, crypticity and body size. The behavioural
 groups are cryptic serranids, roving serranids, and large mobile serranids (Chapter 1). Less
 is known about cryptic and large mobile serranids than roving serranids in the study areas, so
 candidate species from those two groups were the focus of the detailed age-based
 demographic analyses.
 
 A comprehensive account of epinepheline assemblages from the GBR and the Seychelles was
 presented (Chapter 3) using a modified visual survey technique tailored to epinepheline
 serranids (Chapter 2). I described and compared characteristics of epinepheline serranid
 faunas at a range of spatial scales from &lt;1 to 1000&#8217;s km along natural environmental and
 geographic gradients on the GBR and the Seychelles Islands, and provided abundance
 estimates for all three behavioural groups and for the almost 40 species they represent. The
 typical shallow-water, tropical epinepheline assemblages comprised a handful of abundant
 species from the cryptic or roving serranid behavioural groups, plus numerous species found
 only in low densities locally (i.e. rare species, less than 1 fish per 1000 m2) from each
 behavioural group. All five characteristics used to describe assemblage structure (i.e. total
 density of epinepheline serranids; density of each behavioural group; species richness; size
 structure; and species distribution and abundance) varied at broad spatial scales (100&#8217;s to
 1000&#8217;s km) and some at finer spatial scales (1 to 100 km). Three approaches were used to
 explore possible effects of fishing on densities: 1) incorporating the CRC Reef Research
 Centre&#8217;s Effects of Line Fishing Experiment treatments, manipulating fishing level and
 Marine Park zone status for GBR reefs, into the GBR regional comparison; 2) comparing
 reefs open and closed to fishing for Lizard outer shelf reefs; and 3) exploring abundance
 patterns in relation to presumed gradients of historical fishing pressure. Each approach
 indicated some effects of fishing on epinepheline serranids, but patterns were complex.
 
 Comparative demographic analyses were conducted for three species of cryptic serranids, E.
 fasciatus (blacktip grouper), E. polyphekadion (camouflage grouper) and C. argus (peacock
 grouper), from the GBR and the Seychelles based on age estimates derived from thin sectioned
 otoliths (Chapter 4). I described size and age characteristics, longevity, and
 patterns of growth for each species, and explored broad-scale spatial patterns in demography
 and the nature of size-age-density relationships for each species in the GBR and the
 Seychelles. Comparative analyses revealed substantial spatial variation in demographics
 within and among species. Hence, our ability to generalise about the demography of the
 cryptic serranids appears to be limited. Linking information on abundance and demography
 revealed that different combinations of processes may influence local populations of the three
 species, with the possibility of broad-scale compensatory demographic trade-offs dependent
 on density noted for two of the three species. Further, lifespans tended to be shorter in the
 Seychelles than the GBR, suggesting higher recruitment levels and predictability of
 environmental conditions and resources in the Seychelles than the GBR.
 
 I investigated age-specific demographic and reproductive characteristics of E. fuscoguttatus
 from the GBR and examined implications for resource management (Chapters 5 &amp; 6).
 Epinephelus fuscoguttatus (brown-marbled grouper or flowery cod) is an example of a large
 mobile serranid that is widespread throughout the Indo-Pacific and features strongly in the
 live reef food fish trade and other reef fisheries. E. fuscoguttatus had an extended lifespan
 (42 yrs) and unusual reproductive ecology, such as large old females with a reproductive
 lifespan that may exceed 30 yrs and limited spawning in smaller, younger females until about
 9 yrs and 566 mm FL. The spawning period of E. fuscoguttatus in the GBR was relatively
 narrow (November, December and January). Combined evidence from histological analyses
 and age-based demographics suggested monandric protogynous hermaphroditism, although
 confirmation awaits direct evidence of sex change, such as identification of transitional
 individuals.
 
 The two biogeographic-scale studies (Chapters 3 &amp; 4) provided support for the idea that there
 are fundamental differences in the ecology and population dynamics of reef fish assemblages
 over biogeographic scales. The contribution of fishing to the observed patterns could not,
 however, be resolved categorically. While the four aged serranids shared some characteristics
 associated with high vulnerability to fishing, e.g. relatively slow growth and moderate to long
 lifespans (20 &#8211; 40 yrs), differences among them in abundance, demography and body size,
 and perhaps in population dynamics, suggested vulnerabilities to fishing may vary. We still
 lack information on many Indo-Pacific species of epinepheline serranids, and this thesis
 indicates at least some of these, particularly larger bodied species, may be highly vulnerable
 to over-fishing or other threats</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2030/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2030/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tropical cyclone impacts on coral reef communities: modelling the disturbance regime in the Great Barrier Reef region, 1969-2003</field><field name="creator">Puotinen, Marjetta Lee</field><field name="description">Principal objective.  
 Tropical cyclones periodically cross the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), generating large
 waves that cause structural damage to reef communities, ranging from broken corals
 to removal of entire sections of substrate. Over time, repeated impacts can
 significantly alter coral reef community structure. Thus, effective management of the
 GBR requires an understanding of the cyclone disturbance regime (which reefs are
 likely to be affected and how often). The primary objective of this study was to
 characterise the tropical cyclone disturbance regime in the GBR over the past three
 and one-half decades (1969-2003).
 Methods.  
 The spatial distribution of cyclone damage over time across even single reefs for most
 of the GBR is poorly known. Though cyclone disturbance patterns operate over
 century time scales and 100s of km space scales, most studies have examined single
 storm events across a few reefs or many storm events for a single reef. Further,
 detailed observations of cyclone damage to reefs in the GBR are rare. Examining the
 impacts of cyclones over time thus required reconstructing a likely disturbance history
 from what information was available. Meteorological models were used to hindcast
 the likely magnitude and distribution of cyclone winds from the meteorological
 record. This hindcast energy, along with measures of the spatial patterning of reefs,
 was linked statistically to field observations of reef damage to predict the distribution
 of cyclone disturbance of areas not surveyed. This was done for eight types (coral
 breakage, debris scars, soft coral stripping, trenching, sand movement, removal of
 intact slabs, dislodgement of massive corals, and exfoliation) and seven severities
 (presence versus absence of: damage of any type, damage of each type, severe
 damage of any type, total damage score, maximum severity of damage, total damage
 score across low-energy damage types, total damage score across high-energy damage
 types) of damage. Of these models, those that were successful were then used to
 predict the spatial distribution of cyclone damage of various types across the GBR for
 each of the 85 cyclones that passed nearby from 1969-2003. The timing of predicted
 cyclone damage was then examined at each of 24,224 individual reef sites across the
 region, and trends were summarized by one-degree latitude by one-degree longitude
 blocks.
 Results and conclusions
 Four types / severities of cyclone wave damage (coral breakage, dislodgement of
 massive corals, exfoliation and severe [widespread] damage of any type) were
 successfully modeled using a mix of cyclone energy (maximum and duration of high
 winds) and reef vulnerability (geomorphologic type, slope, normal wave exposure)
 parameters. For these, on average, the most recent predicted cyclone damage event
 (measured from 2003) occurred less recently that what was typical over the entire
 time series. This suggests that coral communities have had more time to recover
 since the last cyclone disturbance than would normally be the case, which could mean
 that present measures of broad community structure are not indicative of past
 conditions (i.e. coral coverage may be higher at present than normal). Overall, the
 timing of predicted damage indicates that cyclone disturbance of the GBR is most
 likely intermediate in nature &#8211; coral communities at most reef sites would have had
 time to recover between subsequent cyclone disturbances only some of the time over
 the period 1969-2003. Finally, reefs in the far northern GBR were generally disturbed
 less frequently than elsewhere.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2035/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2035/2/02chapters1-7.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2035/3/03references.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2035/4/04appendices1-5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2035/5/05appendix6.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attitudes and behaviours of teenage Indigenous women in Townsville, Australia, with respect to relationships and pregnancy: the &#8220;U Mob Yarn Up&#8221; Young Parents&#8217; Project</field><field name="creator">Larkins, Sarah Louise</field><field name="description">Becoming a mother during the teenage years is considerably more common among young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women than in the general community. Little is known about the issues facing pregnant and parenting young Indigenous women, yet 21% of Indigenous births are to teenagers, both nationally and locally. 
 Despite falling teenage birth rates overall, rates are rising in some disadvantaged subgroups. Teenage motherhood is generally problematised in the community, although there is debate about whether poorer socioeconomic and educational outcomes are related to the birth itself, or to pre-existing disadvantage. Some have suggested that giving birth as a young woman may be an adaptive response to an extremely limited set of circumstances and options. Initially, the literature about the epidemiology and associations of teenage pregnancy in Australia and globally is reviewed, and then policies and programs and their effectiveness are briefly considered.
 
 This project focuses on how young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women in Townsville &#8220;story&#8221; their past, current and future lives, in particular in terms of sexual relationships and the transition to motherhood, but also in the broader context of current lived experience, family background, and hopes and aspirations. The approach to the analysis of the data is largely data driven. However, it draws heavily on &#8220;storying the future&#8221; as an approach that fits well with the &#8220;insider&#8221; views that were central to this study, and an Indigenous worldview that emphasises networking, family responsibilities and belonging. Young people have a certain amount of agency in terms of creating their own stories, and a fierce desire to exert that agency fully and enthusiastically, however they are limited in several respects. In particular social structures such as socioeconomic status, educational disadvantage, race and racism, and gender inequality, as well as a lack of family material and sociocultural resources may limit the range of stories available to young women. A critical approach was taken, drawing on youth marginalisation theory and a &#8220;storying the future&#8221; approach to privilege the voices of the young people involved and paint a picture of how they are creating their futures in the face of the structural obstacles they face.
 
 Innovative consultative methodology was used, with a Young Mums&#8217; Group operating on a participatory action model serving to design the project, act as key participants and peer interviewers and as a social support group. Ethical principles of consultation, reciprocity and ownership were fundamental to the design and conduct. A multimethod design was chosen, with an inductive qualitative approach based on feminist  principles. Data collection involved semi-structured interviews (individual and smallgroup) and a multimedia computer-assisted self-administered survey (CASI) with peer assistance, involving 186 students from 3 high schools and a homeless youth shelter, and 10 further young mothers. Emerging findings were reported back to participants and discussed with the Young Mums&#8217; Group on an ongoing basis.
 
 Findings from the electronic survey and small group discussions present a picture of young Indigenous people in schools and a homeless youth shelter in terms of their educational and employment aspirations, their health, relationships, sexual practices and contraceptive use, and their views about teenage pregnancy and parenthood. Many students have high educational aspirations, as do their parents, but most students have few mentors or role models, and little clear information about pathways and transitions. They feel limited by low expectations of them at school, and frequently experience racist and oppressive behaviour at school, and overcrowding and other problems at home. Like other young people, they are embarking on sexual relationships, but these are firmly enmeshed in traditional discourses about romance and appropriate feminine and masculine behaviour, with coercion towards sexual intercourse and gender-based power imbalances very prevalent and reputation being a precious commodity. Despite adequate knowledge, contraceptive use is inconsistent, although very few young people want to become pregnant as a teenager. However, if they were to become pregnant, most young people believe they would receive family support, and would not consider options other than continuing with the pregnancy. Thus in terms of these young people, young parenthood may not be so much an active choice, as a lack of alternative options, with different consequences in terms of lost opportunity or social disapproval compared to non-Indigenous young people.
 
 Young Mums&#8217; Group discussions and interviews with young mothers paint a vivid picture of disadvantaged young women struggling with high mobility, family dysfunction and abuse within their families-of-origin, disengaged from a schooling system that was not meeting their needs and drifting in terms of hopes or plans for the future. In this context they often became involved with abusing substances and entered relationships marked by coercion and manipulation. Their pregnancies, although unplanned, were not entirely unwanted, and the birth of their children was the stimulus for a major reorganisation of their life. They viewed their children as a transformative gift, often empowering them to make a series of positive changes in their lives. However, they continued to face difficulties due to inaccessible childcare, housing and education, ongoing relationship difficulties, poverty and stigma and judgement from others. They are clearly asking for practical support to close the gap between their dreams for their family and the limited social realities.
 
 Often in the media and scientific literature, high teenage pregnancy rates are sensationalised as a problem, &#8220;epidemic&#8221;, or crisis that must be fixed. However, this work suggests that our primary aim should not be reducing the rates of teenage pregnancy. Indeed it is morally questionable to pathologise and try to reduce a path which for some may be their only avenue to a maturity recognised in our society, and the only area of their lives over which they have some control, without providing a range of alternative means by which this state may be reached. Rather the emphasis must be on addressing underlying inequalities within society in terms of educational attainment, employment opportunities, and disparities on the grounds of ethnicity and gender, whilst simultaneously providing young people with information and access to a full range of health information and pathways, and empowering them in the area of actively constructing their own futures, and taking control of their reproductive health. At the same time support for young mothers must assist them in being the best mothers they can be, and building a future for themselves and their children.
 
 Finally, the policy implications are discussed and some recommendations for further work and action are proposed.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2036/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2036/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epithermal systems of the Seongsan district, South Korea an investigation on the geological setting and spatial and temporal relationships between high and low sulfidation systems</field><field name="creator">Bowden, Christopher David</field><field name="description">Two distinct styles of epithermal Au-Ag deposits have been recognised globally for the past 25 years or so, low-sulfidation or adularia-sericite systems and high-sulfidation or acid-sulfate systems. Both types of epithermal systems occur in a volcanic arc setting at regional scale, but generally they are not found together at the district scale and the extent to which they are genetically related is often not clear. The Seongsan district of South Korea however, does host high-sulfidation style clay-sulfate-silica deposits that are exploited as commercial sources of kaolinite and dickite. The district also hosts several low-sulfidation Au-Ag mineralised epithermal systems that have only been recognised recently. Little is known about their geological setting, any structural controls on their location, or their relationship, if any, to the nearby clay-sulfate-silica deposits.
 
 Advanced argillic alteration in the Seongsan district has been mined as a source of clay rather than Au and Ag. The region therefore also offers as opportunity to assess the controls on clay ore as well as Au-Ag ore development in a high-sulfidation/acid-sulfate environment.
 
 The primary objective of this project is to investigate the geological setting and the spatial and temporal relationships between the high and low-sulfidation epithermal systems in the Seongsan district of South Korea. The Seongsan district provides the opportunity to examine if the two distinctly different types of epithermal systems are coeval parts of a single hydrothermal event, or separate events formed by different fluids at different times.
 
 The Cretaceous Yuchon Group that hosts the epithermal systems of the Seongsan district comprises a sequence of pyroclastic ignimbrite flows and subplinian, plinian and phreatoplinian fall and surge deposits. Sub-volcanic intrusive domes, flows and proximal to distal pyroclastic and volcaniclastic deposits formed during later stages in the magmatic history. These are all intercalated with epiclastic fluvial, alluvial fan, and lacustrine sediments. The volcanic rocks in the Seongsan district represent an ancient continental silicic volcanic succession. No evidence of a caldera setting was seen in the Seongsan district despite previous workers assumptions to the contrary.
 
 Both low- and high-sulfidation systems are often localised along faults that comprise zones of brittle fractured rock a few cm to 10s of metre wide. Two phases of fault movement and alteration have affected the Seongsan district. Advanced argillic alteration is localised along a network of brittle faults whose internal geometry and slickenlines indicate that high-sulfidation hydrothermal activity occurred during sinistral strike-slip movement. Quartz-Au-Ag veins and associated adularia alteration are localised along younger normal faults. Synchronous reactivation of some strike-slip faults resulted in deformation of the advanced argillic alteration. The structural framework of the Seongsan district was determined to have developed under two distinctly different stress regimes, characterised initially by wrenching (district-scale stress regime 1; &#963;1 north-northeast &#8211; south-southwest) followed by extension (district-scale stress regime 2; &#963;3 north-northwest &#8211; south-southeast).
 
 40Ar/39Ar stepwise heating age data indicate adularia in the low-sulfidation systems crystallised between 77.4&#177;0.5Ma and 78.1&#177;0.3Ma. When coupled with published age data on the highsulfidation deposits, this new data shows that the advanced argillic and adularia-phyllic alteration occurred between 1.3Ma and 5.5Ma apart. Epithermal systems of the district formed during two discrete hydrothermal events, although they could be considered as two parts of a long-lived cycle of crustal convergence, subduction, volcanism and associated hydrothermal activity.
 
 A lack of workable primary fluid inclusions resulted in negligible information being obtained from microthermometric fluid inclusion analyses. Mineral phase relations show that the highsulfidation systems formed under oxidised, acidic, SO4-dominant conditions, whereas the lowsulfidation systems formed under reduced, near-neutral pH, H2S-dominant conditions. Fluids associated with the Au-Ag-bearing paragenetic stages were of intermediate- to low-sulfidationstate, regardless of which epithermal system they formed in. Oxygen and hydrogen isotopic ratios show that a meteoric-derived fluid characterised by a &#948;18O range of -8 to 1&#8240; and &#948;D of - 65 to -100&#8240; formed the low-sulfidation Au-Ag vein systems, whereas a magmatic fluid characterised by a &#948;18O range of 2 to 7&#8240; and &#948;D of -145 to -40&#8240; formed the high-sulfidation systems. Sulfur isotopic ratios of pyrite (-9 to 0&#8240; &#948;34S) and alunite (5 to 7&#8240; &#948;34S) from the high-sulfidation systems show marked fractionation, and imply a SO4-dominant, magmaticsteam origin for fluids that formed the advanced argillic alteration. The relatively narrow range of &#948;34Ssulfide from the low-sulfidation systems implies that the associated phyllic-argillic alteration formed from fluids in which H2S was the dominant sulfur species.
 
 Epithermal systems in the Seongsan district shares many similarities with those in the Comstock district of Nevada, Mt Skukum in Canada, southern Kyushu in Japan and the Mankayan district in the Philippines. All districts show a superimposition of low- on high-sulfidation style alteration (&#177;mineralisation) coupled to a change in structural setting from compression/ wrenching to extension, typically over a period of ca. 1 to 2Ma. This suggests that, although rare, districts that host both high- and low-sulfidation systems share a common structural and hydrothermal evolution.
 
 Rhyolitic to dacitic host rocks and SO4-dominant conditions play critical roles in the development of clay deposits. Metalliferous mineralisation requires sulfur speciation to be H2Sdominant, whereas host rock composition is less critical.
 
 The Seongsan district is possibly the first documented area in Korea, if not globally, that hosts both high- and low-sulfidation epithermal systems that produce economic clay/sulfate and Au-Ag from the same district.

 population that inhabits the lower Mekong River. To achieve my goal, I developed objectives
 based on a conceptual framework of conservation principles and strategies that guide
 management of endangered species. The results of my study provide significant new
 information relevant to the taxonomic status of Orcaella and ecology and conservation of the
 Irrawaddy dolphin population inhabiting the Mekong River, with broader application to other
 freshwater dolphin populations.
 
 Previously, the genus Orcaella was considered to consist of only one species, the Irrawaddy
 dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris). However, two colleagues and I discovered that what were
 previously considered Irrawaddy dolphins occurring in Australian/Papua New Guinean waters
 are instead a separate species, which we named the Australian snubfin dolphin (Orcaella
 heinsohni).
 
 Freshwater Irrawaddy dolphin populations and their habitats are highly susceptible to
 anthropogenic threats. As a result of small population sizes, strict habitat preferences, apparent
 high site fidelity, slow maturation rate, long calving intervals and most importantly, their close
 proximity to human activities in freshwater ecosystems, Irrawaddy dolphins are highly
 susceptible to anthropogenic impacts. Most freshwater populations of Irrawaddy dolphins are
 small and declining; nevertheless, there has been a notable lack of on-the-ground conservation
 measures to conserve these populations. Flora and fauna along the river, as well as local
 subsistence communities, are facing threats similar to those faced by freshwater Irrawaddy
 dolphins. Irrawaddy dolphins should therefore be considered an effective flagship species for
 freshwater biodiversity conservation.
 
 My study area encompassed the lower Mekong River of southern Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam
 and focused on the population of freshwater Irrawaddy dolphins that inhabit this river system.
 The natural environment of the lower Mekong River had previously been shielded from major
 development by war and political upheaval. However, all the lower Mekong countries are now
 developing quickly, and are experiencing significant human population growth. Based on
 conservation lessons learned from other countries, community involvement in habitat and
 species conservation is imperative for conservation efforts to be successful. Preservation of
 habitat is essential, not only to the conservation of endangered species, but also to the survival of subsistence rural human communities, and other flora and fauna that rely on the river ecosystem.
 
 I conducted 497 interviews with local villagers throughout the lower Mekong River to
 investigate local perceptions and knowledge relevant to dolphin conservation. Information from
 these interviews suggests a major decline in dolphin occurrence and abundance throughout most
 of the river. Reports affirm that dolphins previously occurred regularly south of Kratie
 Township to the Vietnamese Delta, but they are now virtually never sighted there. Interviewees
 identified the Kratie to Khone Falls river segment as the most important habitat remaining for
 dolphins in the lower Mekong River. Local communities hold very positive attitudes towards
 Irrawaddy dolphins. These attitudes significantly assist with securing local cooperation for
 management strategies. My study confirms that interviews with local people can provide
 detailed information about changes in species&#8217; distribution and abundance over time, as well as
 about local perceptions towards riverine flora and fauna. Such information may take scientists
 many decades to obtain.
 
 The absolute abundance of Irrawaddy dolphins in the Mekong River was estimated using
 capture-recapture analysis of photo-identified individuals, line-transect, and direct count
 methodologies. I compared these three survey methodologies to ascertain the most appropriate
 survey technique for accurate and precise long-term monitoring. Ninety-nine dolphins were
 individually identified during my study period, with 83% of the population estimated to be
 photographically-identifiable. A closed population model was used for capture-recapture
 analysis. I estimated that a minimum of 127 dolphins (range: 108-146), inhabited the Mekong
 River, as of April 2005. With the highest level of precision obtained from capture-recapture
 abundance estimates (CV=0.07), I estimated that with a CV of 0.07, it would take six years to
 detect a 5% per annum decline, and only two years to detect a 20% per annum decline.
 
 A total of 13,200 km of boat surveys were undertaken throughout the lower Mekong River to
 provide estimates of abundance to compare with capture-recapture estimates. Dolphins were
 sighted only in the Kratie to Khone Falls river section &#8211; no dolphins were sighted south of
 Kratie Township. The largest number of dolphins sighted during upriver direct count surveys
 was 68 (range: 54-88), in May 2001. The largest number of dolphins sighted during downriver
 pool counts was 69 (range: 57-84), in May 2003. Direct counts were deemed an imprecise and
 inaccurate survey method, and not recommended for future monitoring purposes. Line-transect
 analyses estimated 161 dolphins (range: 89-289) inhabited the Mekong River, as of April 2005.
 Based on a combination of photo-identification and line-transect methodologies, I estimated that
 the total Irrawaddy dolphin population in the Mekong River was between 127&#8211;161 individuals (range: 89-289), as of April 2005. Comparisons of survey techniques indicate photoidentification is the preferred methodology for population monitoring because of its efficiency and precision. Irrespective of the differences between survey methodologies, the total number of Irrawaddy dolphins inhabiting the Mekong River is very small and the population is now facing a very uncertain future.
 
 Individual Irrawaddy dolphins exhibit extremely high site fidelity. By analysing ranging
 patterns for the 15 most frequently sighted photo-identified individuals, I estimated a mean area
 ranged of only 16.0 km2 in the dry season (range = 0.7&#8211;73.0 km2) and 42.0 km2 in the wet season
 (range 0.9&#8211;99.0 km2).
 
 Average group sizes during the dry and wet seasons were 6.8 dolphins + s.e. 0.20 (range=1-19,
 n=405) and 5.7 dolphins + s.e. 0.41 (range=1-34, n=107), respectively. School dynamics and
 social structure were investigated using photo-identified individuals. Analysis of association
 patterns revealed that individuals were seen with a particular companion significantly more
 often than would be expected by chance. The relationship between the lagged association rates
 and time lag suggests a &#8216;constant companions model&#8217; i.e., the population is highly structured
 with the majority of individuals having preferred, long-term associates. Association analyses
 indicated four, somewhat discrete, sub-populations. From a management standpoint, my
 research suggests that it is critical that conservation efforts are now focused on the four subpopulations
 and associated critical habitats.
 
 My study provides the first reliable estimates of mortality rates for the Irrawaddy dolphin
 population in the Mekong River and potential causes for these mortalities. Fifty-four dolphin
 carcasses were recovered and/or confirmed between January 2001 and April 2005. Forty-three
 percent of all carcasses recovered were newborns and only two newborns were known to have
 survived longer than six months. The cause of the high number of newborn deaths is unknown.
 Entanglement in gillnets and direct deaths through destructive fishing practices (e.g., dynamite
 fishing) are known causes of anthropogenic mortality. Other potential indirect causes of
 dolphin mortality include: contaminants, boat harassment and noise, boat collision, reduced fish
 stocks, and inbreeding depression. The Irrawaddy dolphin population appears to be declining at
 a yearly rate of at least 4.8%. The most conservative allowable Potential Biological Removal
 (PBR) from anthropogenic mortality is less than one individual/year. Anthropogenic mortality
 must therefore be reduced to zero as a primary management goal, if the population has any
 chance of survival in the river.
 
 I initiated an integrated conservation development project named Dolphins for Development,
 which aimed to provide tangible benefits to the community in exchange for their cooperation
 with conservation efforts. Project components included: (1) rural development and
 diversification of livelihoods; (2) community-based ecotourism; (3) education and awareness
 raising; and (4) strengthening stakeholder relationships. Various project limitations were
 encountered, nevertheless, observable measures of success were evident. To conserve
 endangered species in developing countries, some incentive must be provided to local
 communities. &#8216;Community-conscious conservation&#8217; is a term that I developed to describe
 multidisciplinary, on-the-ground conservation programs that work towards involving
 communities with conservation of endangered species and habitats. Further efforts are also
 required to integrate local conservation efforts with regional and national conservation priorities
 and decision-making.
 
 Based on the preliminary results obtained (i.e., before comprehensive analyses of most data), I
 developed a conservation and management strategy for the Irrawaddy dolphin population in the
 Mekong River, which was adopted as national policy in Cambodia in January 2005. The five
 management goals of this strategy are to: (1) reduce threats and mortality rates; (2) increase
 local education and awareness; (3) effectively manage dolphin-watching tourism; (4) continue
 research and monitoring; and (5) clarify regional and national management responsibilities.
 Based on a comprehensive analysis of my data and acknowledgement of biological and social
 considerations affecting conservation, I developed recommendations built on my original
 MDCP strategy. These recommendations acknowledge that the Irrawaddy dolphin population
 that inhabits the Mekong River is very small, declining, and is in urgent need of effective
 management. The recommendations identify the high priority activities urgently required to
 contribute towards the dolphins&#8217; immediate and long-term conservation.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2038/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2038/2/02Chapters1-11.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2038/3/03References-Appendices.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Systematic conservation assessments for marine protected areas in New South Wales, Australia</field><field name="creator">Breen, Daniel A.</field><field name="description">Science and planning for marine conservation is a complex, cross-disciplinary task. Marine
 conservation involves many objectives and there is much uncertainty in how ecosystems and their
 human populations behave. It is therefore important for environmental managers to access the best
 available information and expertise and to support research that improves conservation outcomes.
 
 This thesis demonstrates through several case studies, how the systematic use of information, decision
 support tools and consultation can be used to identify sites for marine protected areas (MPAs) and plan
 for future research. The studies differ in their immediate goals and the information available. All
 however, benefit from linking explicit objectives to spatial databases and tools that allow scientists,
 managers and communities to explore and evaluate management scenarios using realistic data.
 
 C-Plan, Marxan, Multiple Criteria Analysis and a Geographic Information System (GIS) atlas of 35
 data sets are used to identify comprehensive, adequate and representative systems of MPAs throughout
 the state of New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The studies identify many potential locations for
 MPAs in the Manning, Hawkesbury, Batemans and Twofold Shelf marine bioregions and provide
 information and tools to implement these options. Two of these options have now been established and
 zoned as large, multiple use marine parks near Port Stephens and Batemans Bay. Decisions have yet to
 be made on options for a third large marine park in the Hawkesbury Shelf bioregion.
 
 Potential locations for MPAs were identified from a review of MPA network design theory and criteria
 derived from national identification and selection guidelines. The proposed options for multiple use
 marine parks aimed to include representative and complementary examples of biodiversity surrogates
 defined for &#8216;ecosystems&#8217; (five estuary types and three ocean depth zones) and &#8216;habitat&#8217; types
 (mangrove, saltmarsh, seagrass, rocky shore, beach, reef and island). MPAs were also selected to
 include important sites for threatened Grey Nurse Shark (Carcharias taurus), fishes, birds, mammals,
 wetlands and other values. Criteria with unique conservation values had a greater influence in
 identifying specific locations for MPAs. However, almost all options scored highly for a wide range of
 different criteria and contributed features to complement the overall value of the MPA network.
 
 Options for large marine parks were selected to include the highest complementary conservation values
 in continuous sections of coast, estuary and ocean. However, many other smaller sites outside of these
 parks were identified for their high conservation values. These could be included within smaller local
 MPAs, within other marine parks or at least be targeted by other conservation strategies.
 
 Where possible, locations were chosen that adjoined sections of coast and catchment with a high degree
 of protection in terrestrial protected areas and low levels of urban, industrial and agricultural land use.
 However, in the more populated regions, many distinctive areas of high conservation value were found
 near urban and industrial developments. Management for these areas is therefore all the more urgent
 and still requires attention.
 
 Once a marine park in NSW is declared, a zone plan is required to allocate various levels of protection.
 These include highly protected &#8216;no-take&#8217; sanctuary zones, habitat protection zones where recreational
 fishing is permitted and general use zones that allow some forms of commercial fishing. Broad scale
 bioregional assessments helped identify the general location of the Cape Byron Marine Park and
 assisted in initial planning. However, additional finer scale ecological, social and economic data were
 required to zone different levels of protection within the park. Detailed sidescan sonar, underwater
 video, aerial photography, field studies and community surveys were therefore commissioned and used
 to map ecological, social, and economic values.
 
 C-Plan, Marxan and interactive GIS were then used with community workshops to develop plans that
 addressed conservation goals while minimising impacts on commercial, recreational and cultural
 interests. While a consensus among community representatives was not achieved for all areas, a plan
 for the park was developed that represented a range of conservation values in different zones while
 allowing for different human activities. This two stage approach combines broad and fine scale
 assessments in a cost effective way to quickly obtain reliable data for large areas of coast and ocean.
 
 The assessments also demonstrate the value of uniting information and expertise from scientists,
 managers and communities in practical, science based approaches to ecosystem management. Initial
 proposals for NSW and previously for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, indicated that very little
 data would be available for these systematic marine conservation assessments. However, in both cases
 the number of useful data sets was greater than expected and provided convincing support for decision
 making. Many sites scored strongly for many different important values and while there was some
 duplication among similar data sets, this corroboration provided additional checks against uncertainty.
 
 Collating, formatting and analysing many data sets is a specialised, labour intensive task. However, this
 cost is only a small fraction of the time and effort that goes into consultation and administration.
 Therefore, despite the effort involved, systematic assessments that provide a solid foundation of
 evidence are likely to reduce the overall time required in negotiations to establish MPAs. The MPAs
 established after the assessments in this thesis were substantial, and were implemented within a
 relatively short time span. This suggests that a systematic, information based approach is cost effective
 when compared to the more ad hoc approaches used previously in these regions and elsewhere.
 
 The hierarchical approach used to map marine ecosystems and their components was applied at several
 different spatial scales and at varying levels of complexity. This environmental classification provided
 a comprehensive and cost effective way to describe large areas where only basic information was
 available. However, it also provided a nested framework to accommodate more detailed information
 and targeted research without necessarily biasing decisions towards only well studied locations. The
 hierarchical exploration of goals, criteria and measures through multiple criteria analyses encouraged a
 more thorough exploration of objectives and highlighted where more research was required. These gaps
 included offshore subtidal habitats, variation in species assemblages, the nature of ecological processes
 among marine and adjacent terrestrial ecosystems, and the impacts and values of human activities. The level of knowledge in these fields is encouraging at a theoretical level and for specific, well studied
 sites. However, it is still difficult to generalise this information to the scale of whole ecosystems and
 regions. While techniques to map and model large ecological systems are increasingly available and
 affordable, better support and coordination for this work would benefit all aspects of marine research
 and management.
 
 The different GIS based decision support tools used to integrate complex data sets and assess
 alternative MPA networks were all highly effective. All provided similar results, indeed data input,
 goal selection, reserve design and planning unit size and shape appeared to have a greater influence on
 results than the particular tool used. As these readily available and easily used tools tend to have
 different complementary strengths, it may, therefore, be more important to use at least one or preferably
 more than one tool, rather than dwelling on whether one particular approach is superior.
 
 C-Plan was useful in providing a rapid statistical assessment of irreplaceability under changing
 scenarios of different targets, data and the selection or exclusion of planning units. This made it a
 useful &#8216;hands on&#8217; tool for participatory conservation planning. Marxan provided a flexible and powerful
 tool for goal oriented reserve design with the ability to include criteria for reserve size, spatial
 aggregation, replication and other aspects of reserve configuration. Both were able to incorporate costs
 specified as areas or percentages of ocean occupied by MPAs or as more complex, customised
 estimates of social and economic impacts on fishing and other competing activities.
 
 Unlike C-Plan and Marxan, the multiple criteria models built in Criterium Decision Plus did not
 inherently take into account the complementarity of sites in contributing towards conservation targets.
 However, this method was able to integrate previously calculated estimates of irreplaceability from CPlan
 with over 60 other quantitative and qualitative measures for alternative sites in a hierarchically
 structured tree of MPA goals, priorities and scores. This tool also provided a way to assess sites
 according to varying priorities provided by different individual users.
 
 These decision support tools employ relatively sophisticated techniques which continue to undergo
 development. The assessments explore only part of this potential but the information presented here can
 be easily re-analysed with new data, priorities and issues in marine research and management. The key
 element enabling these possibilities is the use of GIS to spatially integrate, manipulate and display this
 information.
 
 MPAs are not the only way to manage and understand marine ecosystems. However, multiple use
 MPAs, in particular, are ideal venues to test and refine realistic hypotheses about marine ecosystems
 and their management. The geographic models and methods described in this thesis provide the spatial
 foundation on which to develop and design tests for such hypotheses. They are powerful tools to
 integrate diverse information and to model the potential effects of management interventions under
 varying scenarios. They therefore represent an important opportunity to channel the results of
 individual research projects into an wider, systematic and adaptive approach to ecosystem science and
 management.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2039/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2039/2/02Chapters1-5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2039/3/03Chapter6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2039/4/04Chapter7.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2039/5/05Chapter8.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2039/6/06Chapter9.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2039/7/07Chapters10-11.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2039/8/08References-appendices.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coral assemblages and neutral theory</field><field name="creator">Dornelas, Maria Ana Azeredo de</field><field name="description">Neutral theory explains patterns of biodiversity based solely on speciation, demographic stochasticity, and dispersal limitation. The validation of this controversial theory depends on empirical support and it has been largely untested in marine communities. Coral assemblages have been repeatedly invoked as the animal communities most likely to conform to the assumptions of neutral theory. This thesis tested the hypothesis that neutral theory explains the macroecological structure of coral assemblages.
 
 Firstly, I assessed whether neutral models can accurately characterise coral species abundance distributions across multiple scales. Simulation-based and analytical neutral models were fitted to a hierarchical dataset of coral species abundance distributions from across the Indo-Pacific gradient of biodiversity. The dataset has three replicate habitats (slope, crest and flat), and three spatial scales (site, island and region). Both models exhibit significant lack of fit to empirical data at the site and island scales, but not at the region scale. The neutral model consistently underestimates the number of rare species, and overestimates the number of common species. Additionally, the neutral model fits coral abundance distributions less accurately than the poison-lognormal at all scales. Using two formulations of neutral theory, and two goodness-of-fit tests, along with comparisons with the lognormal distribution, ensures that the inferences about coral assemblages and neutral dynamics are robust. Neutral model predictions are consistently and significantly different from observed coral species abundance distributions.
 
 Secondly, I developed a novel test of neutral theory that examines variability between communities of species relative abundances. In neutral communities, species relative abundances are determined by demographic stochasticity or &#8220;ecological drift&#8221;. Thus, communities diverge through time, and are expected to have low community similarity. In contrast, niche apportionment mechanisms have been invoked to argue that higher levels of community similarity should be observed under niche assembly than under neutral dynamics. These contrasting predictions provide an ideal opportunity to test neutral models against empirical data. Relative abundances of species across local communities differ markedly from neutral theory predictions: coral communities exhibit community similarity values that are far more variable, and lower on average, than neutral theory can predict. Surprisingly, empirical community similarities deviate from the neutral model in a direction opposite to that suggested in previous critiques of neutral theory. Instead, the results support spatio-temporal environmental stochasticity as a major driver of community structure at the macroecological scale.
 
 Thirdly, I unveiled a coral local community species abundance distribution. Community structure patterns are notoriously sensitive to sampling issues, and aomprehensive characterization of such patterns requires extremely large sample sizes. Consequently, the fit of biodiversity models to species abundance distributions, and parameter estimates in particular may be sensitive to sample size. To address these questions, over 44,000 corals were counted and identified to species at an exposed crest in Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef. A neutral model was fitted to the species abundance distribution of the total dataset, and to sub-samples of various sizes. Parameter estimates and fit of the neutral model at different sample sizes were compared. The unveiled species abundance distribution appears to be multimodal. Parameter estimates are not affected by sample size.
 
 These results strongly indicate that the limited suite of ecological and evolutionary processes included in neutral theory do not suffice to explain diversity patterns in coral assemblages. In combination, the three approaches included in this thesis suggest that neutral theory is most useful as a null model for community structure. Furthermore, the thesis highlights differences in species&#8217; responses to environmental fluctuations as a potential major driver of species abundance patterns.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2042/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2042/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the effects of the use of financial and operational hedges on Australian corporate foreign currency risk exposure</field><field name="creator">Al-Shboul, Mohammad</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the effects of the use of financial and operational hedging on foreign exchange rate exposure among Australian multinational corporations. Since the flotation of the Australian dollar at the end of 1983, Australian firms have become increasingly exposed to foreign exchange rate risk. To eliminate this risk, Australian firms have undertaken substantial corporate hedging programs, which are both financial and operational in nature. It is notable that there has been an increase in financial hedging techniques such as derivatives and foreign-currency denominated debt, and operational hedging such as diversifying and spreading subsidiaries across foreign countries. Despite the substantial involvement in corporate hedging strategies, there is a paucity of Australian research studies examining the relationship between the use of financial and operational hedging by firms and their levels of foreign exchange rate exposure.
 
 A two-stage market model was used to investigate the main research problem using a sample of 62 Australian multinational corporations. The first-stage model - Jorion&#8217;s (1991) model &#8211; was adopted, to test the first hypothesis of whether there exists a relationship between stock returns and changes in exchange rates, by estimating the exposure coefficients to foreign currency risk during the period from January 2000 to December 2004.
 
 Next, the second-stage model utilised cross-sectional regression models to examine the effects of the use of financial hedging, separately and/or in combination with, operational hedging on foreign exchange risk exposure. This second-stage model was estimated for the 2004 financial year data to test seven hypotheses. These seven hypotheses were related to whether the use of financial separately, or in combination with, operational hedging effectively reduced exposure.
 
 Therefore, eight main research hypotheses were tested in the study.
 Findings of the study were that there is only weak evidence to support the hypothesis that stock returns were sensitive to changes in value of the Australian dollar. It was found that the use of foreign currency derivatives was significantly related to exposure reduction. The use of foreign debt was also found to be significantly related to exposure reduction, indicating that foreign debt is used for hedging purposes.
 
 Furthermore, the combined use of these two financial hedging strategies was found to be significantly associated with the exposure reduction. By the same token, these two financial hedging strategies were found to be substitutive to each other in reducing exposure. Operational hedging proxies were also significantly associated with the exposure reduction. This latter finding indicates that, for the purposes of hedging, firms diversify and disperse foreign operations and subsidiaries across countries and geographical regions. In addition, the combined use of financial and operational hedging was found to be negatively associated with exposure. Finally, the use of financial hedging was found to complement operational hedging in reducing exposure.
 
 The models used in this study could be applied to further research into the relationship between the use of financial and operational hedging and exposure. This could be achieved by using different time spans, different markets (countries) data, and larger samples, together with other measures. As Australian firms are greatly exposed to foreign exchange rate risk and consequently are heavily involved with financial and operational hedging activities, the results of this study could be beneficial to corporate managers, individual and corporate investors, researchers, derivatives designers and regulators.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2044/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2044/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isolation and structural elucidation of cytotoxic agents from marine invertebrates and plants sourced from the Great Barrier Reef, Australia</field><field name="creator">Agrawal, Madhavi</field><field name="description">The interest in the marine environment has been stimulated by the array of biological activities of marine natural products and hence their potential biomedical applications. The advent of high throughput screening has allowed a large number of compounds to be tested for a range of biological activities, in order to assess their potential as pharmaceuticals. This study aimed to discover drug leads from marine invertebrates collected from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) by screening extracts for pharmacological activity.
 
 The pharmacological target was aimed to find novel cytotoxic compounds with potential as anticancer agents. Cytotoxicity was assessed in vitro using the P388D1 mouse lymphoma cell line. Thus 308 samples of marine invertebrates and plants were collected from the central section of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Bioassay guided fractionation led to the isolation and structural elucidation of seven new and twenty known cytotoxic metabolites. Structural elucidation was done via 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy.
 
 Two new brominated polyether triterpenes, Armatols G (193) and H (194) were isolated from the red alga Chondria armata. Compounds (193) and (194) exhibited moderate cytotoxicity, with IC50 values of 5.80 and 6.30 &#956;g/ml. The relative stereochemistry throughout each molecule was determined via NOe experiments and by using Chem 3D and its MM2 energy minimization program to predict the lowest energy conformation. It is proposed that hydrolysis of the acetate functionality and application of the Mosher&#8217;s method for the resultant secondary alcohol should afford the absolute stereochemistry for compound 194.
 
 A new isomalabaricane triterpene, stelliferin D riboside (195) was isolated from the sponge Rhabdastrella globostellata along with the known isomalabaricanes, stelliferin A (43) and compound 51. Stelliferin A (43) and stelliferin D riboside (195) exhibited IC50 values of 0.16 and 1.10 &#956;g/ml respectively.
 
 Five furanoditerpenes were isolated from the sponge Spongia sp. Spongiadiol diacetate (97) was most cytotoxic with an IC50 value of 2.10 &#956;g/ml. This was followed by the new compound isospongiatriol (196) and the known compound epispongiatriol (96) which exhibited IC50 values of 14.0 &#956;g/ml and 16.30 &#956;g/ml respectively. Spongiatriol triacetate (99) was inactive in the assay. Isospongiadiol (109) was not tested due to decomposition of the compound.
 
 A new pentabrominated phenolic diphenyl ether (197) was isolated from the sponge Dysidea herbacea. Compound (197) exhibited a moderate IC50 value of 2.20 &#956;g/ml. All 4 positional isomers of diphenyl ethers that contain a 2,4-dibrominated B-ring and a 1-hydroxytribrominated A-ring with the ether linkage at the 2-position have now been reported from marine sponges.
 
 A deaminated analogue of the known pyridoacridine alkaloid stellettamine (188) was isolated from the ascidian Aplidium sp. (cf Aplidium cratiferum). It was named nordehydrocyclodercitin (200). Cytotoxicity assays could not be performed due to decomposition of the compound, but the cytotoxic activity of many pyridoacridine alkaloids is well documented
 
 Two imidazole alkaloids, isonaamidine E (225) and its zinc complex, bis(isonaamidinato E)zinc (408) were isolated from a Leucetta sponge. The compound was assigned via spectroscopic methods. The electrospray results obtained for (408) were not readily interpreted in our hands, although molecular clusters that contained zinc and chlorine (from isotope patterns) were observed. The structure of 408 was verified by the addition of half an equivalent of ZnCl2 to an isonaamidine E sample, which afforded a 1H NMR spectrum that was identical to that observed for 408.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2047/2/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2047/3/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The maritime archaeology and maritime cultural landscapes of Queenscliffe: a nineteenth century Australian coastal community</field><field name="creator">Duncan, Brad G.</field><field name="description">This thesis develops a new methodological approach to the archaeology of Australian Colonial
 maritime landscapes and communities, based on a critical reading and evaluation of international
 advances in cultural landscape theory and research. It explores the full range of possible maritime
 sites situated both above and below the waterline, and characterizes the archaeological signatures of
 many previously unrecognized maritime and other non- shipwreck related sites associated with
 maritime societies. A key aspect of the thesis are the methods of collection, analysis and integration
 of archaeological, oral and documentary sources, and the complex interplay between the data sets.
 
 The community of Queenscliff (Victoria, Australia), established in 1855, provides a case study by
 which to examine the problem of how to understand the archaeology of non-indigenous
 communities living and working across the land/sea divide. Three maritime themes of defence,
 fishing, and shipping mishaps are explored intensively to investigate the maritime utilization of the
 study area and the differing visibility of these activity types within the diverse data sets, especially
 the archaeological record. They also provide a backdrop for further consideration of the intricate
 web of relationships on land and sea that comprise a maritime community.
 
 Observations of social and practical behaviors are linked to relict material cultural remains through
 the innovative use of GIS technology that facilitates thematic comparative analyses of multiple
 incongruent data sets and provides insights into overlapping landscapes. In particular, the
 availability of a surprising depth of previously unrecognized and unexplored traditional community
 knowledge facilitated striking ethno-archaeological observations that connected maritime culture
 with new types of archaeological sites. The dissertation establishes that understanding of each
 maritime landscape is made accessible only by using highly varied combinations of data sets.
 
 This study clearly shows that in the Australian Colonial setting, non-indigenous maritime
 communities equally access both the terrestrial and nautical environments, and manipulate and
 experience their maritime surroundings in the same way as their terrestrial landscapes. The effects
 of social interaction between terrestrial and maritime groups are demonstrated to be strong
 contributing factors for landscape generation for all sectors of the community, where many crosscutting
 relationships formulate multiple overlapping landscapes and subsequent archaeological
 signatures. These complex and far-reaching social relationships highlight the complexity of
 studying maritime societies, and the strong interrelationship between land and sea areas. The 
 cognitive driving mechanisms of several common types of maritime thematic landscapes in
 Colonial Australia are now better understood, as are their potential data sources and archaeological
 characterizations. Overall, the methodology was highly successful in accessing cultural meanings
 imbued in landscape, leading to a better understanding of the practices and social behaviours of
 maritime communities and providing challenging new research directions for Australian maritime
 archaeology.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2050/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2050/2/02Vol.1Chapters1-5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2050/3/03Vol.1Chapters6-7.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2050/4/04Vol.1Chapters8-10.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2050/5/05Vol.1GlossaryandBibliography.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2050/6/06Vol.2Contents.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2050/7/07Vol.2AppendicesA-B.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2050/8/08Vol.2AppendicesC-E.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2050/9/09Vol.2AppendixF1-3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2050/10/10Vol.2AppendixF-4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2050/11/11Vol.2AppendixG.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The induction and inhibition of post-lesional transcommissural climbing fibre reinnervation in the neonatal and adult rat cerebellum using brain-derived neurotrophic factor: anatomical and functional implications</field><field name="creator">Dixon, Kirsty Jane</field><field name="description">In the adult mammalian central nervous system, reinnervation and recovery from trauma is limited. During development however, post-lesion plasticity generates alternate paths providing models to investigate factors that promote reinnervation to appropriate targets.
 
 Following unilateral transection of the neonatal rat olivocerebellar pathway, axons from the remaining inferior olive reinnervate the denervated hemicerebellum and develop topographically organised normal climbing fibre arbors on Purkinje cells. However, the capacity to recreate this accurate target reinnervation in a mature system remains unknown. This thesis will identify whether one factor, Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is involved in reinnervation during the neonatal period and whether it induces similar reinnervation in the mature system. If BDNF does induce reinnervation in the mature system, this thesis will identify any return of lost function.
 
 In rats lesioned on postnatal days 3 (P3), P15, P20 or P30 and treated with an
 intracerebellar injection of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or a BDNF
 blockade 24 hours following surgery, the morphology and organisation of
 transcommissural olivocerebellar reinnervation was examined using neuronal tracers and immunohistochemistry. The behavioural sequela of these rats was also investigated using vestibulo-spinal reflexes, simple locomotion, complex locomotion and gait synchronisation tests. Additionally, in neonatal rats (P3) with a unilateral lesion and treated with an intraolivary injection of BDNF, the survival of the axotomised inferior olivary complex and associated ipsilateral olivocerebellar pathway was examined using histochemical dyes and neuronal tracers.
 
 In neonatal animals (P3), intracerebellar application of a BDNF blockade prevents olivocerebellar reinnervation of target Purkinje cells in the treatment area, while addition of BDNF in the mature system induces transcommissural olivocerebellar axonal growth into the denervated hemicerebellum. The distribution of BDNF-induced reinnervating climbing fibres was not confined to the injection sites, but extended throughout the denervated hemivermis and, less densely, up to 3.5 mm into the hemisphere. Transcommissural reinnervating axons were organised into parasagittal microzones that were almost symmetrical to those in the right hemicerebellum.
 
 Reinnervating climbing fibre arbors were predominantly normal, but in the P30-lesioned group 10 % branched within the molecular layer forming a smaller secondary arbor, and in the P15-lesion group, the reinnervating arbors extended their terminals almost to the pial surface and were larger than control arbors (p&lt;0.02). Behavioural testing revealed that BDNF and extensive exercise induce olivocerebellar reinnervation and that this reinnervation provides functional recovery, although this is delayed in the vehicletreatment group. Additionally, the behavioural testing revealed that functional recovery is dependent on the age of the animal, whereby animals lesioned prior to acquiring task specific skills were developmentally disadvantaged. Lastly, during the neonatal period intraolivary BDNF transiently prevented degeneration of the axotomised inferior olivary complex, however it was unsuccessful in inducing transcommissural axonal growth of the ipsilateral olivocerebellar pathway into the denervated hemisphere.
 
 For the first time, data from this PhD suggests that BDNF is involved in
 transcommissural reinnervation of denervated areas during the neonatal period and show that BDNF promotes topographically organised morphologically correct reinnervation in the mature rat cerebellum. Additionally, this reinnervation in the mature system provides functional recovery similar to sham-operated control animals. BDNF administered intraolivary however does not maintain the persistence of axotomised olivary neurons or induce transcommissural axonal growth of the ipsilateral olivocerebellar pathway. Data from this study can one day be used to contribute to a repair mechanism for traumatic brain injury, minimising long-term disabilities and ongoing costs to society.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2058/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2058/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dispersal of coral larvae: a modelling perspective on its determinants and implications</field><field name="creator">Blanco-Martin, Bernardo</field><field name="description">In this thesis, I investigate the mechanisms and implications of coral larvae dispersal using spatially explicit and spatially realistic models. Chapter 1 presents an introduction to the relevant theoretical background and a thesis outline.
 
 Chapter 2 investigates the effects of different combinations of larval type (brooders vs. spawners) and current pattern (non-directional flow vs. strongly directional flow) on settlement, connectivity among reefs by larvae, and evenness and diversity of sources of the larval input to reefs. Despite their simplicity, the models revealed complex dynamics, and significant differences in results were found for different larval types, hydrodynamics conditions, and individual reefs. Settlement was higher for brooders than spawners, because their larvae suffered lower mortality during shorter precompetent and competent periods. Increasing advection in the currents increased nonlocal settlement, however connectivity (the number of reefs connected) was not necessarily increased. The traditional view of connectivity being higher in spawners than brooders was often not supported when the currents were strong. Reefs or reefal systems with high evolutionary-scale connectivity did not necessarily have high ecological-scale connectivity. Moreover, different current patterns produced different effects on each larval type. These differences were quantitative for settlement and connectivity, but qualitative for the diversity of the settling larvae (an increase in advection increased diversity for brooders and decreased it for spawners).
 
 Chapter 3 examines the effect of water retention at reefs on the settlement, connectivity, and evenness and diversity of sources of the larval input of different larval types under varying current patterns. Of the common predictions about the effects of an increase in the level of water retention at reefs only the increases in total and local settlement were fully supported. The other predictions (reduction in non-local settlement, connectivity, evenness, and diversity) were supported, but only at medium and high levels of water retention. At low retention levels and when the currents had a steady and strongly directional flow (the most common current conditions) the predictions were not met in many cases. In the absence of retention, settlement, connectivity, and diversity could be very low, especially for larvae with long precompetent and competent periods (i.e. spawners). It was concluded that some level of larval retention at the reefs must exist, at least for spawners, in order to obtain settlement and connectivity values comparable to those found by ecological and genetic studies. Moreover, only very small levels of retention were required to produce dramatic increases in settlement rate, and these levels did not substantially reduce connectivity or diversity. In fact, these levels of retention could increase the connectivity of spawners when the currents had a strongly directional flow, as their larvae could become trapped in the circulation of reefs other than their natal. Notably, the estimated level of retention for a typical reef in the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR) provided the most favourable conditions for spawning corals in the models (which included reef densities and current speeds similar to those found in this region); this retention level maximised evolutionary-scale connectivity, yielded a high ecological-scale connectivity, and vastly increased settlement in spawning corals.
 
 Chapter 4 investigates settlement and the mechanisms determining it on the GBR.
 The models reproduced many patterns of settlement and connectivity previously
 described by empirical studies, including the latitudinal settlement patterns of spawners and their proportion in the total settlement. It was concluded that a significant part of the large spatial and temporal variation in recruitment observed in the field might be related to variation in the factors included in the models, rather than to purely stochastic variation as often assumed. Therefore, settlement may be predictable to a certain extent if enough physical and biological information is available at the relevant spatial and temporal scales. Discrepancies between the models and field observations most likely reflect the importance of factors not included in the models, such as the decrease in temperature with latitude. Although all the models for brooders predicted a decline in settlement from the central to the southernmost GBR, none of them accurately reproduced the recruitment patterns of the northern GBR (all underestimating recruitment in this area). The models that best reproduced the latitudinal patterns of recruitment of spawners included fecundity, indicating the importance of this process in determining regional-scale recruitment. The proportion of spawners in the total settlement was best predicted when the models included retention and adult abundance (fecundity data was not available for brooders). Large differences in settlement and connectivity patterns occurred in space (even among nearby reefs) and among taxa in the models, suggesting the danger of generalising results obtained by empirical studies sampling a small number of reefs and/or species.
 
 Chapter 5 explores the putative relationship between the potential for dispersal provided by the larvae of scleractinian corals and the extent of their geographic ranges the Indo-Pacific (IP). Both the extent of the geographic range and the dispersal variables computed by the models varied substantially among the species in the study. Nevertheless, the potential for dispersal provided by the larvae of coral species was a poor predictor of the size of their geographic ranges. Notably, there was a tentative relationship between estimates of gene flow and some of the variables calculated by the dispersal models (particularly evolutionary-scale connectivity). The dispersal potential of the larvae is an important factor determining the geographic ranges of coral species, but the dispersal hypothesis per se cannot explain the geographic distributions of corals in the IP. The distribution of corals is also influenced by many other factors that mask the effect of the dispersal potential of the larvae in determining the geographic ranges of coral species in the IP.
 
 Chapter 6 investigates the mechanisms by which the patterns of species richness in the IP may have arisen, using a &#8216;Topological Model&#8217; of coral reef biogeography of this region that included speciation, dispersal, and local extinction processes. In the model dispersal occurred randomly (i.e. exclusively by diffusion) over a spatially realistic representation of the IP. This model produced a good approximation (better than previous models) to the present patterns of coral species richness in the IP. It was concluded that currents might not be the dominant factor shaping the geographic distribution of tropical inshore species as previously suggested, the topology of the habitats of the species being at least as important. In the &#8216;Topological Model&#8217; the spatial attributes and relationships among habitats were sufficient for the central IP to act simultaneously as a centre of &#8216;origin&#8217;, &#8216;accumulation&#8217;, and &#8216;refuge&#8217; (without the need of assuming particular properties for this area and/or the currents it receives), consequently generating a centre of species richness. The &#8216;Topological Model&#8217;, alone or in combination with a hydrodynamic model, can be used as a null-model against which the patterns of species richness in the IP can be contrasted.
 
 The spatially explicit and spatially realistic models used in this thesis provided significant insights into the factors determining the dispersal and settlement of larvae and their consequences. These models can be used for guiding the conservation and management of marine populations; they should, however, be adapted to each specific problem, and contain adequate information about the physical conditions and organisms in question.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2057/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2057/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hydrothermal processes in barren and mineralized systems: insights using fluid inclusion microanalysis and geochemical modelling</field><field name="creator">Bertelli, Martina</field><field name="description">The study of fluid inclusions in this thesis was used as a research tool to characterize fluids associated with specific types of deposits and related hydrothermal systems and to investigate ore deposition processes with the ultimate aim of addressing key questions relating to ore genesis. Two magmatic-hydrothermal systems were investigated. The first part of the thesis focuses on the study of the Suicide Ridge Barren Breccia Pipe (SRBP; ~ 1527 &#177; 4 Ma), located in the Snake Creek area, in the Cloncurry district, Australia. The pipe is one of numerous breccia systems that characterize the Cloncurry District and is temporally and spatially associated with a granite that outcrops at its south western boundary and which is ascribed to the Williams and Naraku magmatic event (ca 1550-1500 Ma). The breccia is characterized by clasts of variable dimensions, degree of rounding and composition that includes dominant calc-silicate clasts of the Corella Formation that underlie rocks of the Soldiers Cap Group that host the pipe. This indicates a dominant upward transport of the fragments. Other breccia fragments include granite bodies characterized by albite-quartz rocks that have textures typical of the magmatic-hydrothermal transition. These rocks likely formed in a fractionated carapace of a granite during the exsolution of volatiles associated with the cooling magma. Two dominant types of inclusions have been identified in these textures and include early primary and pseudosecondary CO2-rich and secondary sodic-calcic brine inclusions. The CO2-rich fluid inclusions represent fluid released from the crystallizing magma and variable homogenization temperatures in the primary and pseudosecondary inclusions indicate that they were trapped under different pressure conditions. Pressures estimated from the primary CO2 fluid inclusions suggest that they were trapped at 4.2 kbar, at least 1 kbar above the inferred lithostatic pressure. This likely represents the overpressuring produced by release of CO2-rich volatiles during the crystallization of magma and which ultimately caused the subsequent brecciation. Sodic-calcic fluid inclusions represent a later influx of fluids in the breccia system that produced widespread albitization. Bulk crush leach analysis suggests that the carbonic fluid inclusions in the granite clasts have either a magmatic origin or formed from the dissolution of evaporites (or mixing of the two), whereas the sodic-calcic inclusions may have been sourced from bittern brines.
 
 The study also included LA ICP MS analysis of fluid inclusions from the SRBP and the Eloise Cu-Au deposit in order to address the key differences between barren and mineralized hydrothermal systems in the Cloncurry district. The major difference between the barren breccia pipe and IOCG deposits is the absence in the former of multisolid high salinity, high temperature fluid inclusions, suggesting that these were critical for the formation of IOCG deposits. Fluid mixing was a key deposition mechanism at Eloise as indicated by the general abundance of Ba in multisolid fluid inclusions, that possibly suggests S-poor fluid, the variable chemistry of fluid inclusions consistent with a mixing trend and the significant lower of salinity that characterize later fluids compared to the ore forming fluid that can not be attributed to precipitation of Cl-bearing phases. The preferred model for ore deposition at Eloise is fluid mixing between hot, ultrasaline Cu-bearing, S-poor fluid, evolving as the result of cooling and wall rock reaction as it migrated in a northern direction and a S-bearing fluid cooler fluid. Possible sources of sulphur include the later halite-bearing fluid inclusions and CO2-rich fluid inclusions. 
 
 The second part of the study focused on the base metal-rich, high-temperature, carbonate-replacement Bismark deposit in northern Mexico. Previous fluid inclusion studies based on microthermometry and PIXE showed that the Zn-rich, Pb-poor 
 Bismark deposit formed from a moderate salinity magmatic fluid but the exact precipitation mechanisms were unclear. Furthermore, PIXE data suggested that Pb and Zn concentrations were comparable and inconsistent with the Zn-rich nature of the ore. In this study LA ICP MS analysis of the same fluid inclusion populations was carried out to compare with the PIXE data and the new results were used to model possible ore deposition mechanisms. The new laser ablation data revealed overall lower concentrations of Pb in the ore fluid (average value ~336ppm) than previously indicated by PIXE analysis (average value ~713ppm). Chemical modelling using this new data tested the following processes: 1) cooling; 2) fluid-rock reaction at constant temperature; 3) cooling and simultaneous fluid-rock interaction. Modelling results show that the gangue and ore minerals observed at Bismark are best reproduced by fluid-rock interaction with simultaneous cooling. Results from the simulations strongly indicate that ore deposition was mainly driven by a pH increase due to the neutralization of the acidic ore fluid (pH = 3.9) through reaction with the limestone.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2059/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2059/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of the impacts of climate variability and climate change on the wild barramundi (Lates calcarifer): a tropical estuarine fishery of north-eastern Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Balston, Jacqueline Marie</field><field name="description">Scope
 As is the case overseas, the wild fisheries of Australia are under increasing threat from the pressures of over-fishing, habitat destruction and water quality degradation. In addition, inshore fisheries that are dependant on freshwater flows to provide nutrient pulses and nursery habitats are also affected by changes in natural flow regimes as a result of water impoundment and extraction (Robins, Halliday et al. 2005). The barramundi (Lates calcarifer) is an important commercial fish species in Australia worth $8.8 million in 2004/05 (ABARE 2006), and supports valuable tourism and recreational fishing industries. Commercial catch displays a high degree of inter-annual variation; a characteristic that many fishers believe is the result of climate variability.
 
 However, apart from rainfall and freshwater flow, previous studies of the barramundi have not examined the impacts from climate in any detail, and existing management strategies do not consider natural climate variability or climate change. This study examined the effects from long-term (biannual to decadal) and short-term (inter-annual) climate variability, extreme and threshold climate events, and anthropogenic climate, change on the commercial catch of wild barramundi in north-east Queensland. The possibility of incorporating climate parameters into the management of the fishery was also examined.
 
 Methods
 A life cycle model of the barramundi was developed to link climate parameters with the complex developmental stages of the species from spawning in the estuary through maturation in freshwater rivers. Fisheries and climate data were extracted from a variety of sources and compiled for analysis. A gamma distributed logarithm link function model was constructed to calculate total freshwater flow for those years when records were incomplete. Correlation analysis identified significant relationships between climate parameters and catch, and forward stepwise ridge regression was used to develop a model of barramundi catch using climate parameters as predictors. The impact of threshold events was determined by non-linear analysis and the effects of extreme events on barramundi habitat were qualified against MODIS satellite imagery.
 
 A selection of climate change scenarios from a range of global climate models (GCMs), were run through the predictive model developed to determine the likely impacts of future anthropogenic climate change on the fishery.
 
 Results
 In the near-pristine Princess Charlotte Bay area, warm sea surface temperatures, high rainfall, increased freshwater flow and low evaporation (all measures of an extensive and productive nursery habitat) were significantly correlated with barramundi catch two years later as recorded by the CFISH logbook system. These results suggest that early barramundi survival is enhanced in these conditions. Catchability was significantly increased after high freshwater flow and rainfall events in the year of catch, a result that reinforced previous observations that mature fish in freshwater habitats are flushed into the commercial estuarine fishery. October &#8211; December rainfall and April &#8211; June flow showed non-linear asymptotic relationships and annual evaporation a quadratic relationship, with commercial catch two years later. Curves peaked at approximately 325 mm, 245 000 Ml and 2 000 mm respectively, a result that demonstrated that once these hydro-meteorological threshold events occurred, the response from the fishery was reversed and subsequent commercial barramundi catch reduced. A comparative analysis of data from the Fitzroy River area, a catchment and near shore area that has been highly modified by human intervention, showed only increased freshwater flow prior to the wet season enhanced subsequent barramundi catch. This result indicated that the anthropogenic changes to habitat either affected or masked the relationship between other climate variables and barramundi catch in the area.
 
 Total long-term barramundi landings as recorded by the Queensland Fish Board for six regions along the north-east coast of Queensland showed a near decadal cycle. Correlation analyses returned significant relationships between catch and the January &#8211; March average L-index (a measure of the latitude of the subtropical ridge) two, three and four years prior to catch, and the Quasi-biennial Oscillation (QBO) three and four years prior to catch. These results suggest that each of these cycles affects climate in the north-east Queensland region and subsequent survival of barramundi in the early life cycle stages, and provides an opportunity to estimate catch a number of years in advance.
 
 A forward stepwise ridge regression model was built to predict commercial barramundi catch in Princess Charlotte Bay. The model contained July &#8211; September rainfall and annual evaporation two years prior to catch and explained 62% of the variance in catch and had a cross validated predictive R2 of 59%. A second model also contained April &#8211; June flow in the year of catch (a measure of catchability). This second model explained 69% of the variance in catch and had a cross validated R2 of 61%, however, the improvement was not statistically significant. Using the nine global climate models in the OZCLIM program set for three initiating TAR SRES markers (A1B, A2 and B1), a suite of twelve climate change scenarios was generated for the years 2030 and 2070 for Princess Charlotte Bay. These scenarios were then run through the predictive barramundi model developed. Results indicated that due to a likely increase in annual evaporation, barramundi catch in the area will decrease for all future climate scenarios including those that show an increase in July &#8211; September rainfall. An analysis to calculate future sea surface temperatures using REEFCLIM indicated that, depending on the availability of suitable habitats, it is possible that the range of the species will extend further south by up to 800 km by the year 2070 as temperatures increase.
 
 Conclusions
 Results from this study indicate that a significant proportion of the variability seen in commercial barramundi catch in north-east Queensland is driven by variability in climate. Climate signals are significant at both short and long-term time frames and for some variables the impact is non-linear beyond a defined threshold. Anthropogenic changes to the fishery habitat alter or mask the relationship between climate and barramundi catch, and possibly affect the reproductive success of the species. The likely impact of future anthropogenic climate change will be a reduction in barramundi catch in areas where an increase in evaporation results in a subsequent decrease in shallow wetland habitats essential for early life cycle survival. This thesis provides supporting evidence for policy makers to improve significantly both the prediction of future barramundi catch and the sustainable management of the species by considering the impacts of climate variability and climate change on the species, and by incorporating climate variables into catch models.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2060/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2060/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical conditions on marginal coral reefs</field><field name="creator">Whinney, James Christopher</field><field name="description">The Great Barrier Reef Lagoon (GBRL) is an area of great biodiversity containing 350 species of corals, 10 of which are endemic to the region. In recent years many threats to this ecosystem have been revealed, such as crown-of-thorns starfish and coral bleaching as well as excess concentrations of nutrients and sediments. Information on the effects of water quality and also the amounts of nutrients and sediments that reefs are subjected to is limited. This is especially true for inshore reefs where issues of water quality are most important.
 
 This work focuses on the Rockingham Bay and Family Islands region. In this region a reef in Lugger Bay near Mission Beach was selected for a detailed study. It is a highly marginal reef (a reef occurring close to perceived environmental thresholds for coral survival) with high levels of sediments and organic matter and close to the mouths of two rivers: the Tully and the Hull. This makes the reef one of the most at threat from eutrophication and increases in sediment. Part of this work was to document all the physical conditions of the reef including currents, wind speed and direction, light levels, temperature, nutrients, and suspended sediment concentration (SSC). The reef&#8217;s health and age were also found by means of photographic surveys and core samples respectively.
 
 The main results from the study showed a reef surviving in extreme physical conditions. The SSC on the reef were very high, exceeding 200 mg/l for 28% of the time. Light extinction was common, occurring on 49% of the days that data was recorded. The local rivers did not have much effect on the SSC or nutrient concentrations on the reef. The Tully River only has a wet-season average SSC of 23 mg/l and a maximum of 230 mg/l; resuspension was much more significant. Coral cover on the reef was reasonable, about 57%, and algae only covered 12% of the coral. However, coral species biodiversity was low, with one species of Porites making up 85% of the coral cover. These results indicate that some species of coral are able to survive in areas of high sediment and nutrient concentrations, and that clean rivers in the GBRL are not a great threat to coral reefs. 
 
 The SSC data was also used to develop an empirical model, which predicts SSC for a specific site using just wind data. The model is accurate enough to be used in environmental monitoring to predict an expected SSC, which can be prepared with observed SSC from a site where marine construction is taking place so it can be determined whether the work has increased the SSC to a dangerous level. This makes it an important tool as many such construction projects occur in the GBRL each year and there is no other accurate method of determining what the natural SSC would be if work was not taking place.
 
 A new instrument was also developed to infer nutrient concentrations in the water column, to try to overcome problems with existing methods. The instrument works by measuring the speed at which algae grow on a glass plate using a fluorometer. Tests were made to determine how well algal growth would relate to nutrient concentrations, if other factors like temperature, light levels and algal type were not controlled. Results showed that growth was too dependent on these other factors to be a good indicator of nutrient concentrations. The sensor could, however, be used to determine the effect nutrients have on algal growth, which in itself is a potential threat to corals.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2063/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2063/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Marine mammals in the Savu Sea (Indonesia): indigenous knowledge, threat analysis and management options</field><field name="creator">Mustika, Putu Liza Kusuma</field><field name="description">The Savu Sea in the Province of East Nusa Tenggara is an important area for marine mammals in Indonesia, supporting at least 19 cetacean species as well as the dugong. The deep inter-island channels of the Savu Sea are sites of upwellings and other oceanographic processes which benefit marine mammal populations. Two traditional communities (Lamalera village on Lembata Island and Lamakera village on Solor Island) hunt whales in the Savu Sea, a practice which impacts on marine mammal populations but which is poorly documented. Through this research, I examine the current status of the whale hunting cultures in the Savu Sea as well as the social construction or perception of several stakeholders concerning traditional hunting practices. I also analyse other anthropogenic activities that might adversely impact on marine mammals in the region, and provide management options for marine mammal conservation in the Savu Sea and Indonesia in general.
 
 To gain preliminary information in a relatively short period of time, I used a RRA (Rapid Rural Appraisal) approach. I conducted my research between May and December 2004, interviewing 60 informants from various places in Solor, Lembata, Alor and Rote Islands, as well as in Kupang (the capital of East Nusa Tenggara), Jakarta and Bandung (West Java). The nature of my research question resulted in qualitative data that I examined using thematic analysis and social construction theory.
 
 I conclude that the whale hunting traditions in Lamalera (Lembata Island) and Lamakera (Solor Island) are subsistence whaling according to the IWC (International Whaling Commission) definition. This tradition appears not to be important anymore for the villagers of Lamakera. However, it is still a very important part of the cultural and spiritual identity of the Lamalera villagers. Although recently the whale catch has been relatively low, the Lamalera fishermen have compensated by increasing the catch of small cetaceans and other marine megafauna such as whale sharks, sunfish, manta rays, etc., confirming their high dependency on non-fish products. The preliminary nature of this research did not allow a calculation of the sustainable harvest level or PBR (Potential Biological Removal) of whale hunting in Lamalera thus this practice is still considered a threat to the local whale population. However, the research revealed that there are many other threats to marine mammals in the Savu Sea that should be considered when designing marine mammal management. These threats include IUU (illegal, unregulated and unreported) fishing, marine traffic, oil-gas exploration and exploitation, and commercial displays of marine mammals.
 
 Several management options for marine mammals in Savu Sea are proposed. Further investigation is recommended to fully understand the magnitude of each threat to the marine mammal populations, which in the end will affect traditional whale hunting in Lamalera.
 
 This research offers insights into issues that could be included in the recently proposed government plan to establish the Solor-Alor Marine Protected Area. Alternative livelihoods for whale hunters and destructive fishers should be appropriately designed. Alternative fisheries to reduce the dependency of Lamalera villagers on marine megafauna products might also be a feasible option.
 
 I recommend that Indonesia consider becoming a signatory to the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS). As an international body that facilitates the management of migratory species, CMS can assist Indonesia in management of and research into marine mammals, especially the species targeted by whale hunters. So far, Indonesia is an MOU signatory to the CMS. By becoming a CMS signatory, Indonesia is more likely to engage further collaboration with Australia and other countries that have been conducting extensive research on marine mammals.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2064/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2064/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The splashing morphology of liquid-liquid impacts</field><field name="creator">Cole, David</field><field name="description">In this thesis, a systematic experimental study of the flow behaviour resulting from
 liquid-liquid impacts has been conducted. Numerous new flow behaviours have been
 identified including microbubble formation from floating drops, pre-entrapment jetting,
 multiple primary bubble entrapment, downward jets penetrating the entrapped bubble,
 the break-up of the downward jets to leave drops entrapped inside the entrapped bubble
 and small vortex ring formation in the early stages of the post-entrapment jetting
 regime. These new flow phenomena have been combined with existing flow behaviour
 to produce the most comprehensive maps (both quantitative and qualitative) describing
 the splashing morphology of liquid-liquid impacts to date. It was found that six different
 flow regimes were required to adequately categorise all the flow behaviour.
 
 The physics of the cavity formation and collapse were investigated with high speed
 video and high framing rate particle image velocimetry. The formation and collapse of
 the cavity can be described as a six stage process. Initially, the cavity expands due to the
 inertia of the impact and the majority of the displaced fluid is driven into the wave
 swell. After the energy of the impact has been dissipated, the side walls of the cavity
 stagnate and the growth of the wave swell also stagnates. This causes the fluid
 contained in the wall swell to begin flowing downward under the influence of gravity.
 As the fluid flows down, the base of the cavity stops growing and begins to retract.
 These actions give rise to a vortex mid way down the cavity and acts to collapse the
 cavity. The fluid driven by the vortex then converges at the base of the cavity along the
 axis of symmetry.
 
 The formation of the vortex was shown to be centred around a stationary line that forms
 on the cavities interface. Several interesting properties of this stationary line were
 discovered. The depth at which the stationary line forms is almost constant for the same
 drop size and is independent of impact velocity. The dimensionless width of the cavity,
 Dw
 ' was shown to scale to Fr1 3 . The formation of the stationary line was also shown to
 influence how the flow converges at the base. The wider the cavity grows, the greater
 the rotation the fluid undergoes before converging along the axis of symmetry. Thus, for
 small width cavities the flow tends to converge while the fluid is being directed
 downward. While for larger width cavities, the flow tends to converge with a strong
 upward component. This has lead to the formulation of three different flow convergence
 criteria: downward convergence, parallel convergence and upward convergence. All
 jetting modes or lack of jetting can be described using one of the three convergence
 criteria.
 
 For cavities that are small and thus have a downward flow convergence condition, no
 jetting occurs. This type of flow convergence occurs in the primary vortex ring regime
 and may assist in the development of strong coherent vortex rings. A parallel flow
 convergence condition is responsible for forming high-speed jets in both the preentrapment
 jetting and primary bubble entrapment regimes. Here, the flow is similar to
 two parallel jets impinging on each other. This action forms a stagnation point and a
 significant rise in the local pressure around this zone follows. This leads to a strong
 inertial force that drives a small jet of fluid back up into the cavity. Cavity retraction
 acceleration was measured as high as 90 000g during this time. The maximum exit
 velocity of the secondary drops formed from the break up of the thin high-speed jets
 was measured to be in excess of 30 m/s. In the primary bubble entrapment regime it was
 postulated that multiple stagnation points would form and interact with each other to
 produce variable jet velocities across the regime. The retraction velocity of the cavity
 was also shown to have a direct correlation with the exit velocity of the first drop. An
 upward flow convergence condition was found to be responsible for the thick slow
 moving jets observed in the post-entrapment jetting regime.
 
 All modes of bubble entrapment were investigated and the quantity of air each mode
 can entrap has been estimated. It was found that the most efficient method to produce
 microbubbles was by forming jets in the post-entrapment jetting regime that pinch off
 secondary drops with Weber numbers ranging from 6 to 20. This produces drops that
 fall into the primary microbubble entrapment regime to produce thin films that rupture
 into thousands of microbubbles. Methods for determining the volume of entrapped air
 from the break up based on the rupture velocity of the film are presented. The entrapped
 air in the bulk fluid is equivalent on average to 0.3% of the original drop volume.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2065/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2065/2/02Chapters1-2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2065/3/03Chapter3Part1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2065/4/04Chapter3Part2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2065/5/05Chapter3Part3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2065/6/06Chapter4Part1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2065/7/07Chapter4Part2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2065/8/08Chapter4Part3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2065/9/09Chapter5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2065/10/10Chapter6-7.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2065/11/11ReferencesandAppendix.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling the solids transport phenomena within flighted rotary dryers</field><field name="creator">Lee, Andrew</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the development and testing of a solids transport model for

 relevance of this research is outlines. Chapter 2 gives a review of literature pertaining
 to the modelling and analysis of solids transport in flighted rotary dryers.
 
 Chapter 3 discusses the development of the solids transport model based on the
 physical behaviour of a flighted rotary dryer. The solids transport model was
 developed based on numerical methods, dividing the dryer into a number of discrete
 slices, and each slice was further separated into two discrete phases. One phase
 selected to represent the material contain in the flights and in the bottom of the drum,
 whilst the other phase was selected to represent the solids falling through the moving
 gas stream. The flow of solids between phases was based on the physical movement
 of solids that occurs within an actual dryer. The magnitude of these flows was
 described using solid residence times and partitioning coefficients.
 
 The solids transport phenomena occurring in the two phases were described using the
 geometry of the dryer and the physical properties of the solids. Chapter 4 presents a
 model for the unloading profile of a generic unserrated, straight, two-section flight,
 which was developed based on geometric analysis of the holdup within a flight. This
 unloading profile was then used to calculate the average fall path of a solid particle
 within a dryer, and thus the time spent within each phase of the dryer. Using
 measurements from CSR Invicta Mill&#8217;s raw sugar dryer number 2, the average fall
 time of a particle was found to be in the order of 0.9 seconds, and the average time a
 particle spent in the flights to be in the order of 9 seconds. These residence times were
 then used to govern the flow of solids within the overall solids transport model, and
 the methodology describes a generic approach to modelling flighted rotary dryers.
 
 A flight unloading apparatus was used to validate the geometric flight unloading
 model, the methods and results of which are presented in Chapter 5. The apparatus
 consisted of a 1m length of a full scale industrial dryer flight, which was rotated at a
 controlled rate, and the rate at which material was discharged recorded. Tests were
 conducted using three different flight geometries and three different solid materials at
 rotational speeds between 1 and 8 rpm. It was found that the geometric unloading
 model accurately represents the experimental unloading profiles across the full range
 of conditions tested. High-speed photography was used to observe the solid material
 during unloading, and to measure factors such as the cascading curtain thickness,
 surface particle velocity and dynamic angle of repose. It was found that the dynamic
 angle of repose of the solids was dependent on the rotational velocity of the apparatus
 and showed significant variability. Surface velocities were found to be in the order of
 1 m/s and surface thickness was found to be closely linked to the unloading rate of the
 flight. The data from these experiments was used in simulating interactions between 
 gas and solids in the falling curtain in the following chapter.
 
 Study of the high-speed photographs and unloading profiles revealed that the
 unloading of the flight was discontinuous, even though the materials used were
 generally regarded as free flowing. Observation of both the unloading profile and the
 high-speed images showed the flight unloading in pulses, with periods of high flow,
 and periods where less material was unloaded. This resulted in a varying material
 surface within the flight, which contributed to the high variability in measurements of
 surface properties. The effects of flight serrations and the methodology of modelling
 air drag in particulate curtains was also described.
 
 Chapter 6 presents a study on using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate
 the gas-solids interactions within a falling curtain of solids. Experimental results from
 wind tunnel experiments conducted at Monash University, Melbourne, were used to
 verify and validate the CFD model. The simulated results showed good agreement
 with the experimental data for solids displacement and velocity. Data from the flight
 unloading experiments were then used to simulate the behaviour of the falling curtains
 of solids that occur within a rotary dryer. Simulations with a single curtain showed
 that gas-solids interactions were minimal for the conditions studied, with solids only
 being displaced in the first 10-20cm of the falling curtain. Simulation using multiple
 curtains in close proximity (50-80mm apart) showed that channelling of the gas flow
 between the curtains was significant (increases in gas velocity of up to 25% were 
 observed), and resulted in greater displacement of the falling curtains. However,
 limits on computational requirements prevented further study of this phenomena.
 
 Chapter 7 presents the validation of the solids transport model using experimental
 data from an industrial flighted rotary dryer. The geometric flight unloading model
 was integrated into the overall solids transport model for a rotary dryer, and
 experimental data from Invicta Sugar Mill&#8217;s dryer number 2 was used to statistically
 determine the remaining model parameters to validate the model. For a model using
 33 slices, the kilning phase residence time was estimated to be 7.7 seconds, with 54%
 of the falling solids undergoing backmixing. It was found that the solids transport
 model provided a good fit to the experimental data, however it was unable to match
 the extended tail of the experimental curve. It was found that the number of slices
 used in the model to represent the dryer had a minimal influence on the quality of the
 statistical fit to the experimental data. Due to the inability of the solids transport
 model to match the extended tail of the experimental RTD, alternative model
 structures were considered and studied. However, the alternative model structures
 considered showed similar or poorer fits to the experimental data, and techniques to
 enhance the fit are described.
 
 Further study of the model predictions revealed an improbable amount of kilning
 material within the dryer, with less than 5% of the solids within the dryer present in
 the falling curtains of solids. This in turn resulted in large amount of solids
 undergoing kilning, resulting in kilning being the dominant mode of solids transport
 within the model. This is believed to be unrealistic, and emphasised the need to
 undertake further experimental research into kilning and holdup in flighted rotary
 dryers. Based on the observations made in this thesis, a number of recommendations
 are made for the further development of solids transport models for rotary dryers, and
 these are presented in Chapter 8.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2066/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2066/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A method of optimal image subtraction: development of the mathematics and software for general use in astronomical research</field><field name="creator">Miller, J. Patrick</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a new and scalable implementation of an optimal image subtraction
 (termed &#8220;OIS&#8221;) method proposed by Alard &amp; Lupton (1998). A novel feature of this
 work is that it is written in the most commonly used image processing language,
 Interactive Data Language (IDL), and can be easily used by other astronomy research
 groups. In fact, one research group at the Departamento Sistema Solar Instituto de
 Astrof&#237;sica de Andaluc&#237;a at the direction of Dr. J.L. Ortiz uses the IDL code in its work
 with trans-Neptunian objects (TNO) light curves.
 
 The code is tested extensively on professional image sets. Subtractions from the IDL
 code show the detection of brightness-varying objects including supernovae (SNe), active
 galactic nuclei (AGN), and variable stars, and position-changing objects including Main
 Belt asteroids, Kuiper Belt objects, comets, and SNe light echoes. Sought, but not yet
 detected, was an exoplanet transit.
 
 Original astronomical discoveries are presented including SN 2006al, and SN 2006bi.
 Presented also is a subtraction that effectively separates SN 1999av from its host galaxy
 using an image set from two different telescopes. New AGN candidates are presented,
 some of which do not appear in the literature. Also presented are the discoveries of 76
 Main Belt asteroids made by student participants in the International Asteroid Search
 Campaign.
 
 A complete derivation is presented of the linear system of equations for the space-varying
 kernel used in the OIS method. The set of vectors that define the Gaussian components
 basis (GCB) are presented, and a new delta function basis (DFB) is introduced and shown
 to produce better subtractions than the GCB.
 
 A complete derivation of the linear system of equations, to correct the differential
 background, is presented. Also presented is the re-definition of the basis vectors used to
 conserve the photometric flux. This presentation proves the conversation of the flux, and
 includes a number of proofs of theorems involving two-dimensional convolutions.
 
 The OIS method uses sub-images, called &#8220;stamps&#8221;, that are small sections of images,
 each containing one star, used to define the kernel. An automated stamp selection
 procedure was designed utilizing utilities from the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC)
 IDL User&#8217;s Astronomy Library. This procedure is presented including the masking of
 bad pixels within the image sets prior to selecting the stamps.
 
 The Magnier method is presented that aligns image sets with no or small differential
 rotation. The sub-pixel adjustment issue is addressed using two methods, piecewise
 cubic splines and polynomial interpolation convolution kernels. The complete derivation
 of these convolution kernels is presented.
 
 An attempt to define the quality of an OIS using a quality index is presented. This
 attempt is only partially successful. It identifies improvements in subtractions using the delta function basis, but not the Gaussian components basis. The quality index shows
 that the DFB produces better subtractions than the GCB.
 
 Finally, a complete listing of the IDL source of the computer codes is found in the
 appendix. These listings include the differential background correction, alignment and
 sub-pixel adjustment, masking of moving object and SNe subtractions, and the space varying

 values associated with the submerged World War II sites located in Chuuk Lagoon, Federated
 States of Micronesia. The submerged WWII sites are representative of the war phase in the history
 of Chuuk and part of Chuuk&#8217;s colonial period. They are valued and used by the three relevant
 groups, Chuukese, Japanese and Americans in different ways that are indicative of a range of social,
 cultural, economic and political connections. I have investigated these connections using a postprocessual
 approach to underwater cultural heritage management to appreciate contemporary
 societies and issues, and site management.
 
 Understanding Chuukese contemporary societies and issues includes understanding Chuukese local
 history. After 1,800 years of regional seclusion, Chuukese experienced a number of foreign contacts
 and colonial rulers. As a result, they experienced a number of changes and adapted and adopted
 practices for their own benefit. During World War II, Chuuk was utilised as a major Japanese base
 in the same manner as Pearl Harbor was to the United States of America (U.S.), and Chuukese were
 dominated by a large Japanese military presence. War and suffering came to Chuuk on 17 February
 1944 with the commencement of the U.S. bombing of the base and the associated cruelty of some
 Japanese military personnel. The base was bypassed by U.S. amphibious forces during their 1944
 conquests in the western Pacific and not only left to &#8216;wither on the vine&#8217;, but used in U.S. bomber
 tests, British aircraft carrier tests, and discussed as a target for U.S. atomic bomb tests.
 
 Chuuk was dominated and Japanized pre-war, which had a number of consequences, including
 many marriages between Japanese men and Chuukese women. Although there was an initial hatred
 of the Japanese post-war, many Chuukese today acknowledge their Japanese ancestry and many
 older Chuukese lament the &#8216;good&#8217; pre-war Japanese days, as compared to the poor current services
 and supplies that came after the war.
 
 With the loss of over 50 million lives, World War II was a watershed in &#8216;world&#8217; history and the
 bombing of the Japanese base in the Chuuk lagoon was an important historic event in relation to
 this. But for the Chuukese, this is not &#8216;world&#8217; history, but their &#8216;local&#8217; history. This research focuses
 on gaining an understanding of Chuukese local history, including the values associated with the war
 and the submerged WWII sites. The need to have a local perspective and to be socially inclusive
 (rather than objectively scientific) is inherent in this approach. It has revealed that submerged
 WWII site management takes it cue from Cultural Resource Management (CRM) approaches that
 privilege archaeological values of sites that are then used to prescribe site management. The Chuuk
 Lagoon submerged World War II sites are currently managed and promoted according to the
 dominant Euro-American values, that is, as significant sites associated with the U.S. conquering the
 Japanese during World War II, and as a focus for international tourism. Chuukese values have not
 been acknowledged , and while Japanese values are acknowledged, they are ignored. These values
 can be complex, they can conflict, perhaps especially in relation to those of the Euro-American
 approach. However, I argue that the lack of Chuukese and Japanese values in this approach is
 indicative of neo-colonialism, and the continued contested nature of World War II and its
 remembrances. This investigation has also revealed that conflicts between Chuukese and Japanese
 values are related to past colonialism and the impacts of World War II.
 
 The value of this research is in demonstrating how a more socially inclusive, less scientific
 approach in investigating submerged WWII sites, will facilitate better understanding of the range of
 meanings inherent in this important submerged landscape. It is anticipated that it could result in a
 more valuable and viable methodology for site management. This research also demonstrates that
 submerged WWII sites can have value, meaning and relevance for contemporary societies, in
 addition to their role as repositories of the past. This study has also revealed apparent paradoxes in
 war sites that both commemorate war and are used as peace memorials, which in association with
 the conflicts shown in Chuuk Lagoon illustrate the need for less domination and more inclusion.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2068/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2068/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular ecology, evolution and conservation of hydrophiine sea snakes</field><field name="creator">Lukoschek, Vimoksalehi</field><field name="description">Hydrophiine sea snakes are the most speciose group of extant marine reptiles. Species occur in
 a variety of shallow-water habitats throughout the Indo West Pacific with highest species
 diversity in northern Australia and South East Asia. Each of these regions hosts a suite of
 endemics but they also share widespread taxa. Viviparity distinguishes hydrophiine sea snakes
 from many other marine taxa, and reproductive outputs are low and dispersal potentially
 restricted. These life-history characteristics predict strong population subdivision for marine
 hydrophiine species. Nonetheless, species preferentially occur in different habitat types that are
 predicted to restrict dispersal and gene flow to varying degrees and result in divergent genetic
 signatures among species. These ecological, evolutionary and life-history characteristics make
 marine hydrophiines an excellent group for comparative study, yet surprisingly little is known
 about their genetics, evolution and conservation. In this thesis I use molecular genetic
 techniques to explore the evolutionary history of the marine hydrophiine lineage, and
 population genetic processes for two sea snake species in northern Australian waters, and
 discusses the implications of results for conservation.
 
 Evolutionary relationships among marine hydrophiines were first formalised using
 morphological characters and traditionally three lineages have been recognised: the Aipysurus
 lineage (nine species in two genera), the Hydrophis lineage (~40 species: ~27 in the genus
 Hydrophis and the remainder in ten additional genera), and three &#8216;primitive&#8217; monotypic genera.
 While taxonomic revisions and controversies abound, none has been based on modern
 molecular techniques. This study used mitochondrial DNA sequencing to infer evolutionary
 relationships among representative marine hydrophiine species from the Aipysurus lineage (six
 species), Hydrophis lineage (15 species), and two &#8216;primitive&#8217; genera. Parsimony, likelihood and
 Bayesian analyses of cytochrome b (1080 bp) and 16S rRNA (510 bp) sequences yielded the
 same optimal tree that grouped Aipysurus and Hydrophis species into strongly supported
 reciprocally monophyletic clades. Relationships among species and genera in the Aipysurus
 lineage were well resolved however the same was not true for the Hydrophis lineage. The ratio
 of phenotypic to genetic diversity for the Hydrophis lineage was four to seven times greater
 than for the Aipysurus lineage. This evidence, together with the poorly resolved relationships
 among Hydrophis lineage species, suggests that this lineage is a rapidly diverged adaptive
 radiation, probably driven by sea level fluctuations in South East Asia that promoted vicariance
 and speciation. In contrast, the Aipysurus lineage appears evolutionarily stable.
 
 Sea level perturbations not only influenced speciation patterns in South East Asia and
 northern Australia, they also left footprints on the population genetic signatures of marine
 taxa in this region. The cyclic emergence of the Torres Strait land bridge between Australia
 and New Guinea, repeatedly sundered east and west coast populations in Australia, with
 subsequent range expansions into new shallow water marine habitats as sea levels rose. These
 biogeographical perturbations invoke three broad scenarios regarding the directions of interglacial
 range expansion (west to east, east to west, or bi-directional). These hypotheses were
 evaluated for two widespread and abundant hydrophiine species that differ in their habitat
 preferences, distributions and evolutionary histories. The olive sea snake, Aipysurus laevis, is
 restricted to Australasian waters where it occurs primarily on reefs, a relatively discontinuous
 habitat with potential barriers to dispersal. In contrast, the range of the spine-bellied sea
 snake, Lapemis curtus, (Hydrophis lineage) extends from Australia to the Arabian Gulf, and
 this species occupies a variety of shallow-water habitats with fewer barriers to gene flow.
 
 A fragment of the mtDNA ND4-tRNA region (726 bp) was sequenced for A. laevis (n = 354)
 from 14 locations in three regions - the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), the Gulf of Carpentaria
 (GoC) and Western Australia (WA). Forty-one variable sites defined 38 putative haplotypes.
 Each region was characterised by a unique suite of haplotypes that comprised one or two
 common and numerous rare haplotypes. There was marked population subdivision (FST =
 0.61, p &lt;0.001; &#61686;ST = 0.78, p &lt;0.001) and coalescent analyses revealed no migration between
 regions. Genetic diversity in the GBR and GoC was low and within-region &#8216;star&#8217; phylogenies
 indicated range expansions consistent with recent marine transgressions ~7,000 years ago. In
 contrast, genetic diversity on most WA reefs was higher with no signal of recent expansion
 events. Phylogenetic reconstruction indicated that GBR and GoC haplotypes were derived
 from WA haplotypes, suggesting west to east dispersal. However, network analysis supported
 range expansion in the GBR and GoC by refugial east coast populations, possibly from the
 Coral Sea. Patterns of gene flow within regions reflected the potential connectivity among
 sub-populations afforded by regional habitat types. Taxon-specific microsatellite primers
 were developed for repeat regions sequenced from positive clones screened from unenriched
 and enriched genomic libraries. Population genetic analyses of five microsatellite loci
 revealed weaker population subdivision (FST = 0.059, p &lt; 0.001: RST = 0.029, p &lt; 0.0013) but
 similar patterns of population structure. Bayesian clustering analyses identified two
 populations with individuals from a combined GBR - GoC group distinct from WA.
 
 Sequences of the ND4-tRNA region (706 bp) for L. curtus (n = 62) revealed 20 variable sites
 and 17 haplotypes from seven Australian locations and Thailand (n = 2). Six locations in the
 GBR and GoC shared one common haplotype, however the 14 rare haplotypes were not
 shared between regions and generally not shared among locations. Phylogenetic and network
 analyses revealed a classical &#8216;star&#8217; phylogeny with rare haplotypes arranged around the
 widely distributed common haplotype, and genetic diversity was low, suggesting that
 Australian waters were colonised recently by one L. curtus matriline, probably from South
 East Asia. Two divergent haplotypes sampled in Thailand indicated strong population
 subdivision at larger spatial scales. Population subdivision in Australia was low (FST = 0.097,
 p &lt; 0.032; &#61686;ST = 0.039, p &gt; 0.05), yet the relationship between genetic and geographical
 distance revealed a pattern of isolation-by-distance along a geographical gradient consistent
 with the continuous habitat types used by L. curtus. This pattern of isolation-by-distance was
 not found for A. laevis suggesting that habitat discontinuities between reefs within regions act
 as barriers to gene flow, particularly in WA and the GBR. Microsatellite loci for Australian L.
 curtus individuals were either monomorphic or had very low allelic diversity. By contrast, the
 two individuals from Thailand had private alleles at several loci.
 
 The conservation status of hydrophiine sea snakes is poorly known, however, recent reports
 suggest declining abundances and loss of endemic aipysurids on protected Australian reefs.
 Threatening processes for reef-associated species, such as A. laevis, are unclear but must
 include habitat degradation and loss. Aipysurus laevis typically occurs at discrete reefs and
 may be influenced by metapopulation dynamics. Factors driving spatial and temporal stability
 of local populations are poorly understood and it is not clear whether specific conservation
 strategies, such as networks of marine protected areas, will ensure the persistence of this
 species. Classification tree analyses of distribution data of A. laevis on 90 reefs in the
 southern GBR (surveyed 1 to 11 times over 35 years) indicated that its status on reefs (present
 = 38, absent = 38, changed = 14) was related to reef location, exposure, and area (data on
 potential biotic factors were not available). Perhaps more importantly, the prior protection
 status of reefs did not account for A. laevis&#8217; distribution. Despite the ability of A. laevis to
 expand its range into new marine habitats, contemporary gene flow appears restricted. The
 regional distinctiveness of mtDNA lineages suggests that the GBR, GoC and WA comprise
 separate management units warranting independent conservation strategies for this species.
 Lapemis curtus had higher levels of gene flow; however, this species accounts for &gt; 50% of
 sea snake by-catch in Australian trawl fisheries, with tens of thousands caught annually. The
 direct impact on populations is unknown but reduction in by-catch is undoubtedly desirable.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2071/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2071/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards sustainable wildlife tourism experiences for certified scuba divers on coral reefs</field><field name="creator">Miller, Dean Kevin</field><field name="description">The economic opportunities created by SCUBA diving tourism are significant to reef-based communities, as are the potentials for positive outcomes for coral reef environments such as preservation and conservation. These potentials are largely dependent on the quality of the reefs and the marine life that occur there. However, this is rapidly being compromised worldwide by natural (e.g. cyclones, crown-of-thorns), anthropogenic (e.g. extractive fishing and collecting activities, tourism, deteriorating water quality), and global (e.g. coral bleaching) impacts. These impacts have the potential to damage and/or remove the biophysical attributes of coral reef sites most significant to divers&#8217; experiences, and are therefore likely to have a negative affect on the demand and visitation for dive sites and locations.
 
 The purpose of this study was to investigate how the biophysical attributes that occur at coral reef dive sites influence certified SCUBA divers&#8217; experiences, and whether variations, measured using experience-based theoretical approaches, can be explained by participants&#8217; level of Diving and Coral Reef History (DACRH) using the recreational specialization construct. To address the research objectives, a multidisciplinary methodology was developed that described the certified SCUBA diving opportunity in a Recreational Opportunity Spectrum (ROS) and Limits of Acceptable Change (LAC) experience-based framework. This required natural science methodologies to measure, describe, and understand the biophysical attributes that occur at tourism sites, and social science techniques to describe and understand the divers, and the experiences they were having. To achieve this, a four-study research program was designed.
 
 Study One assessed certified SCUBA divers participating in live-aboard diving trips visiting selected Great Barrier Reef (GBR) and Coral Sea dive sites. Based on divers&#8217; levels of participation, training and associated skills, and coral reef setting history, they were separated into four recreational specialization groups: &#8216;beginner&#8217; (n=46), &#8216;intermediate&#8217; (n=236), &#8216;enthusiast&#8217; (n=246), and &#8216;specialist&#8217; (n=52). Each group was found to be distinct from the others in terms of previous diving and coral reef history measurements, ownership of SCUBA related equipment, and the levels of coral reef interest and knowledge.
 
 Study Two was an assessment of the biophysical attributes that occur on selected coral reef dive sites from the GBR and Coral Sea, and aimed to determine what visiting certified SCUBA divers were most likely to encounter while diving on the specific sites. This study found that differences in the biophysical attribute measurements at each site characterised the main differences between the sites, and thus the diving opportunities.
 
 Study Three analysed the coral reef SCUBA diving experiences for divers on these trips and showed that divers had very high quality experiences on the dive sites, with some sites providing more enjoyable experiences than others. Divers were also having a wide range of experiences, and these were closely linked to the biophysical attributes identified in Study Two. However, some attributes, such as reef sharks and coral quality, were much more important to experiences than other attributes such as small fish life.
 
 Finally, Study Four examined divers&#8217; experiences in the context of their degree of recreational specialization. This study found that diving experiences are modified by specialization, with higher specialization resulting in a wider diversity and richness of best experiences, but lower reported levels of enjoyment and evaluations of quality. More specialized divers also perceived a greater number and diversity of environmental impacts than less specialized divers, and these negatively influenced their experiences.
 
 The research presented in this thesis has demonstrated that taking an experience-based approach to understanding the biophysical attributes that occur at tourism sites, as well as understanding the visitors and the experiences they are having, can play a critical role in managing natural areas for their ecologically sustainable use by tourism. This is achieved by identifying those biophysical attributes most significant to a wide range of divers&#8217; experiences. This level of understanding will be essential to the maintenance and protection of quality experiences for visitors. This is because many of the attributes significant to divers&#8217; experiences identified in this research are also at high risk of being impacted by the activities of extractive users, tourism operators and tourists, and also the affects of natural events and global scale processes. Finally, recommendations are made concerning the management of those biophysical attributes most at risk from damage and/or removal.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2078/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2078/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing public perceptions of sentencing in regional North Queensland and how these perceptions compare to current legal guidelines</field><field name="creator">Finch, Pauline Jean</field><field name="description">The current study utilised a within groups design to explore whether a disparity exists between society&#8217;s beliefs about sentencing and the guidelines that are present within our legal system and whether specific extra-legal variables relating to participants and the
 victim within a crime scenario significantly influence the sentencing process. Participant characteristics were explored in order to determine whether the age, gender, victim history and beliefs (locus of control beliefs (LOCB) and just world beliefs (JWB) have the potential to significantly impact upon the sentencing recommendations that individuals feel are appropriate for offenders. Sentencing recommendations made by participants were also compared to the sentencing guidelines within the Queensland legal system. Finally the project aimed to determine whether providing victim information within a specific crime scenario would significantly impact on the sentencing recommendations of participants.
 
 The current research utilised the offence of manslaughter as the crime of interest because previous research has identified this crime as being of sufficient severity to elicit variability within sentencing recommendations (Rachlinski &amp; Jourden, 2003). The manslaughter offence was presented within a scenario as a component of a questionnaire. Within the questionnaire participants were also required to provide demographic information and complete two self-report assessments, Rubin and Peplau&#8217;s (1975) Just World Belief Scale and Rotter&#8217;s (1966) Locus of Control Scale.
 
 The research findings revealed that participants sentenced differently across the crime definitions, and their recommended sentence lengths were significantly longer than those currently utilised within the Queensland legal system. The results also revealed that contrary to the research hypothesis participant characteristics including age, gender, victim history and beliefs did not significantly impact on sentencing recommendations. It was further hypothesis that victim characteristics would have a significant impact on sentencing recommendations however the results failed to achieve significance. Finally the results found that sentence lengths recommended did not significantly vary from the crime definition to the crime scenario as predicted.
 
 This project explores the discrepancy between public opinion and legal guidelines with regard to sentencing, with the results indicating that the public may not be as influenced by extra-legal variables as often suggested. The findings from this study will hopefully contribute to discussion and decisions regarding the role of jurors in the sentencing process with the overall aim being to improving sentencing consistency within the courts.
 
 In order to analyse the data collected the following analyses were completed. The analysis included paired t-tests to compare sentencing recommendations across the ten crime definitions, a MANCOVA analysis to asses whether the sentences recommended significantly differed across the ten crime definitions with regard to the extra-legal variables, ten one-sample t-tests were conducted to compare the average sentencing recommendations of participants to the courts average sentences. A 5 x 2 ANCOVA was completed to analysis the interaction between sentence lengths recommended and participant and victim variables, and finally three t-tests were completed to determine whether there was a significant difference in sentencing recommendations for the crime definition as compared to the crime scenarios, and to determine whether there was any significant differences in sentencing recommendations for the crime scenario in relation to participant gender and participant victim history.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2075/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2075/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Age-related differences in verbal, visual and spatial memory: the same or different?
</field><field name="creator">Shaw, Rhonda M.</field><field name="description">Working memory comprises a number of components, each responsible for the processing of different types of information. The phonological loop is responsible for processing verbal information while the visuo-spatial sketchpad is responsible for processing visual and spatial information. Age-related differences in verbal working memory are well documented with older adults consistently shown to have shorter memory spans than younger adults. Declines in spatial memory have also been reported. The data for visual memory performance however is less clear, with some researchers reporting decline across the adult lifespan and others reporting no difference. The purpose of the current thesis was to examine performance on a number of verbal, visual and spatial memory tasks in an effort to determine whether each type of memory declined with increased age and if so, whether they were affected by age to the same extent. Three studies were conducted to achieve these aims.
 
 The first study explored the role of articulatory suppression, which has been shown to disrupt performance on verbal memory tasks; the effect on visual and spatial memory tasks is not so clear however. Fifty university undergraduates (12 men, 38 women) aged between 18 and 53 years (M =24.38; SD = 8.62) completed verbal, visual and spatial memory tasks of differing memory set sizes under suppression and no suppression conditions in Study One. Results show that performance on all the tasks at each set size was significantly affected by concurrent verbal suppression. It was concluded that articulatory suppression prevents participants from verbally encoding visual and spatial stimuli, leaving them to rely on purely visual or spatial representations. As a result articulatory suppression may provide researchers with an effective means to examine these types of memory with minimal contributions from the verbal system.
 
 Study Two examined the reliability and validity of nine working memory tasks. One hundred and two first and second year psychology undergraduates aged between 18 and 56 years (M = 23.96, SD = 9.78) completed three verbal, three visual and three spatial working memory tasks. Seventy-three of these participants returned for retesting 14 days later. Results show that the test-retest reliability of the tasks was adequate to good with reliabilities ranging from 0.51 for letter orientation to 0.89 for the arithmetic task. Three factors, interpreted as verbal, visual and spatial factors, emerged from the data, accounting for a total of 58.8% of the variance. The tasks, with the exception of letter orientation, appeared to be reliable and valid indicators of the constructs they were designed to measure and were therefore used in Study Three of the current thesis. However, it is suggested that the psychometric properties of the tasks be examined in additional and preferably larger samples and using a smaller memory set size and different age groups.
 
 Study Three examined age-related differences in verbal, visual and spatial memory using all of the tasks from Study Two except for letter orientation. Letter orientation was replaced with a letter location memory task, which was similar in design to the dot memory task used in Study Two. Two hundred and one university undergraduates and community dwelling residents aged between 18 and 80 years, 139 females and 62 males (M = 44.95; SD = 21.08) completed three processing speed tasks, three verbal, three visual and three spatial memory tasks. Results of a 3 (task: verbal, visual, spatial) &#215; 3 (age group: young middle, older) mixed ANOVA with Bonferroni corrected comparisons revealed that there were no significant differences between young and middle aged adults performance on the verbal, visual or spatial memory tasks. Significant differences were revealed between the young and older adults&#8217; verbal and spatial memory performance but not for visual memory performance. The differences between the middle and older age groups&#8217; verbal, visual and spatial memory scores were significantly different.
 
 The relationship between age and each type of memory was examined using a series of regression analyses. The first, using age as a predictor of each type of memory, showed that age explained a significant amount of the variance in verbal (11%), visual (3%), and spatial (16%) memory. After controlling for processing speed, the amount of age related variance on each type of memory decreased (verbal 5%, visual 0.08% and spatial 9%). Speed acted as a partial mediator of verbal memory variance and a full mediator of visual memory variance but not of spatial memory variance. Regression models using age, number of medications and processing speed explained a significant 15% of the variance in verbal memory, 17% of the visual memory variance and 17% of the spatial memory variance. Age made significant contributions to verbal and spatial memory variance but not to visual memory variance. Processing speed made significant contributions to the variance in verbal and visual memory but not in spatial memory. The number of medications taken per day was the strongest contributor to visual memory variance.
 
 Because the n-back tasks used in this study may have been tapping central executive processes, further models were examined using these tasks as a central executive variable along with age, number of medications, and processing speed. The results of these analyses revealed that the model explained a significant 36% of the variance in verbal memory, 32% of the visual memory variance and 28% of the spatial memory variance. The central executive variable was the strongest contributor to the variance in verbal memory (25%) and visual memory (11%); however age remained the strongest contributor to spatial memory variance (12%). Processing speed no longer made a significant contribution to verbal memory variance when the
 central executive variable was included in the model. 
 
 It was concluded that verbal, visual and spatial memories do decline with age but only after middle age; there appears to be little difference between young and middle aged adults. It was also concluded that verbal, visual and spatial memories are differentially affected by age with age explaining more of the variance in spatial memory than in verbal and visual memory. Age does make a significant contribution to verbal memory variance but it is not a significant predictor of visual memory performance. Hence, the decline in visual memory performance after middle age is not age-related but appears to be related to other variables such as the number of medications a person takes each day and to the efficiency of central executive functioning. The relationship between verbal, visual and spatial memory performance and processing speed is also not the same across the lifespan, with processing speed mediating the variance between age and verbal and visual memory, but not spatial memory. Finally, it appears that the central executive plays an important role in performance levels on each of the different types of memory but not to the same extent in each subsystem.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2077/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2077/2/02_whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Professionally developing teachers or teachers developing professionally? A narrative inquiry into the professional development experiences of three primary school teachers in North Queensland</field><field name="creator">Mensinga-Payard, Christine Margot</field><field name="description">Professional development for teachers has long been seen as a major way in which student learning outcomes can be improved and as a way in which new educational practices can be instituted within the education system. Education Queensland policy documents, statements and reports indicate a concerted effort needs to be made in Queensland to ensure that change practices yield successful and consistent results across the state in order to provide quality educational outcomes for all Queensland students. However, considerable research has demonstrated that reform strategies and change practices often yield mixed results in terms of effectiveness. According to a wide body of research, the most effective form of educational change requires the participation of teachers not only as receptors and conduits of reform, but as determiners and mediators of change. So, what really happens in the professional development of our teachers, particularly in regional Queensland? 
 
 This research project describes professional development experiences of three primary school teachers in a regional setting in 2001/2002 using a narrative inquiry approach described by Clandinin and Connelly (2000). The narratives of these participants indicate that professional development is an individual experiential process that is ongoing and occurring within a complex professional landscape incorporating biographical, social, historical and systemic contexts of operation. Teachers&#8217; professional development is integrally associated with stories of identity over time and incorporates negotiated relationships with others who share the educational landscape they inhabit. This narrative inquiry includes not only the participants&#8217; perspectives of their experiences, but also mine as a researcher using a narrative inquiry process. The reader is invited to view teachers developing professionally from the individual&#8217;s perspective and consider the value of such perspectives when considering teachers&#8217; professional growth within our schools.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2081/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2081/2/02whole_.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A survey of Australian psychologists in aged care: the relationship between training, attitudes and professional practice with older clients
</field><field name="creator">Koder, Deborah A.</field><field name="description">The proportion of Australian adults aged over 65 years is due to increase over the next
 20 years with corresponding increases in mental illness. A growing demand for clinical
 psychology services to older adults is expected yet overseas surveys indicate a low rate
 of specializing in working with the over-65 age group. The status of geropsychology in
 Australia is examined through exploratory analysis of survey data from a practising
 psychologist sample and from a post-graduate psychology trainee sample. Six published
 studies are reported that examine the relationship among training, personal contact and
 attitudes, and the relative contributions of these three factors to decisions on working
 with older adults among Australian psychologists. Pilot research highlights the
 importance of interest in working with older clients and additional training external to
 formal degree courses in discriminating between those psychologists who specialised in
 aged care compared to generalist practitioners. A national survey of psychologists
 identifies clinical exposure to older adults while training and negative expectations of
 subjective ageing as additional factors predicting specialist category membership. Low
 rates of professional involvement with older clients in general highlight the
 corresponding dearth of psychologists specialising in aged care service provision, a
 finding congruent with overseas research. The positive influence of clinical contact, as
 opposed to the absence of predictive ability for personal contact, is also emphasized in a
 survey of post-graduate psychology students. Professional attitudes, such as confidence
 and interest in working with older adults, are other predictors of interest in working
 with older clients among students. The use of the Reactions to Ageing Questionnaire in several analyses also highlights the importance of affect in influencing behaviour, with
 professional attitudes predicting personal attitudes towards ageing, as opposed to
 personal contact or formal training. The final study underscores the role of contextual
 relevance, with training contributing to more variance in interest in working with older
 adults among trainees, as compared to practitioners whose professional interest was
 influenced more by attitudes. The contact hypothesis is not confirmed in this research in
 either the student or the practitioner samples. Strategies to promote the field of clinical
 geropsychology across a variety of settings, ranging from training to clinical service
 delivery are discussed.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2119/2/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2119/1/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dinuclear polypyridyl ruthenium(II) complexes as stereoselective probes of nucleic acid secondary structures</field><field name="creator">Smith, Jayden A.</field><field name="description">This thesis reports on the nucleic acid-binding properties of a series of dinuclear
 polypyridylruthenium(II) complexes of the general form [{Ru(pp)2}2(&#956;-BL)]4+ {where pp =
 2,2&#8242;-bipyridine (bpy), 4,4&#8242;-dimethyl-2,2&#8242;-bipyridine (Me2bpy), 5,5&#8242;-dimethyl-2,2&#8242;-bipyridine
 (5,5&#8242;-Me2bpy), 1,10-phenanthroline (phen), and 4,7-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (Me2phen);
 BL = 2,2&#8242;-bipyrimidine (bpm), 1,4,5,8,9,12-hexaazatriphenylene (HAT), 1,4,5,12-
 tetraazatriphenylene (4,7-phenanthrolino-5,6:5&#8242;,6&#8242;-pyrazine; ppz), 2,3-bis(2-pyridyl)pyrazine
 (2,3-dpp), and 2,5-bis(2-pyridyl)pyrazine (2,5-dpp)}. These complexes encompass three
 general geometries as governed by their bridging ligands &#8211; &#8220;linear&#8221; (bpm), &#8220;angular&#8221; (HAT,
 ppz, 2,3-dpp) and &#8220;stepped-parallel&#8221; (2,5-dpp) &#8211; and incorporate a systematic variation of
 terminal ligand hydrophobicity and bulk. The stereoisomers of each complex were isolated by
 means of cation-exchange chromatography and characterisation was achieved using 1H NMR
 and CD spectroscopy.
 
 Fluorescent Intercalator Displacement (FID) assays were used to survey to relative binding
 affinities of this array of complexes to a library of oligonucleotides incorporating a variety of
 different duplex, bulge, hairpin loop and quadruplex-forming sequences. Notable trends were
 observed with respect to terminal ligand identity (increased hydrophobicity typically correlated
 to stronger binding), bridging ligand identity (the &#8220;angular&#8221; class of complex was usually the
 strongest binding), and stereochemistry (the meso diastereoisomer of a given complex typically
 demonstrated the greatest affinity). Additionally, the metal complexes generally demonstrated a
 heightened affinity for more open oligonucleotide structures such as bulges and loops, as well
 as AT-rich duplex sequences.
 
 A small number of discrepancies were noted in the results of the FID assays wherein the
 relative order of binding affinity implied by the FID assay contradicted that suggested by other
 experiments (NMR, equilibrium dialysis, affinity chromatography). These discrepancies were
 rectified by replacing the intercalating dye used in the assay (ethidium bromide) with the minor
 groove-binder DAPI (4&#8242;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole), the binding mode of which more closely
 resembles that of the metal complexes being investigated.
 
 Electronic absorption titration experiments conducted with several of the complexes and
 calf thymus DNA confirmed the correlations between ligand identity and stereochemistry seen in the FID (and modified DAPI-displacement) assays. Intrinsic binding constants obtained from
 these titrations were within the range of mid-104 to low-105 M-1, consistent with previously
 published values for dinuclear complex-calf thymus DNA interactions. Analogous titrations
 using yeast tRNA yielded binding constants of a similar magnitude, but in these experiments no
 clear relationship was evident between the nature of a given complex and its binding affinity.
 One- and two-dimensional NMR experiments were used to probe in greater detail several
 of the more notable metal complex-oligonucleotide interactions (as implied by the results of the
 FID assays). These experiments confirmed the minor groove-binding nature of this genre of
 metal complex and reaffirmed the oligonucleotide selectivities implied by the FID assays.
 [{Ru(bpy)2}2(&#956;-bpm)]4+ and [{Ru(Me2bpy)2}2(&#956;-bpm)]4+ were found to bind poorly to a duplex
 control sequence {d(CCGGAATTCCGG)2} and relatively weakly to the analogous sequence
 possessing a single-base bulge {d(CCGAGAATTCCGG)2} and an octadecanucleotide
 containing a four-base hairpin loop {d(CACTGGTCTCTACCAGTG)}, all consistent with the
 affinities demonstrated by these particular complexes in the FID experiments. Conversely, the
 meso diastereoisomers of [{Ru(phen)2}2(&#956;-HAT)]4+ and [{Ru(Me2phen)2}2(&#956;-HAT)]4+
 confirmed their strong affinities to a six-base hairpin loop sequence {d(CACTGGTCTCTCTACCAGTG)}. Each complex bound strongly to the stem-loop
 interface of the icosanucleotide as evidenced by selective broadening of T-methyl and aromatic
 resonances corresponding to protons within the loop/stem-loop interface. The extent of
 broadening observed in these NMR experiments, coupled with the performance of each
 complex in the FID assays, suggests a stronger yet less selective interaction by the Me2phenversion
 of the complex. This significant broadening of both the icosanucleotide and metal
 complex spectra prohibited a thorough NOESY characterisation of the binding, but the few
 NOE signals that were obtained confirmed binding of the complexes at the stem-loop interface
 and facilitated the construction of molecular models of each interaction.
 
 NMR experiments were also used to investigate the unexpectedly-favourable association
 meso-[{Ru(phen)2}2(&#956;-ppz)]4+ and the duplex oligonucleotide sequence
 d(ATATATATATAT)2. Again, both the metal complex and oligonucleotide spectra exhibited
 significant broadening upon interaction, suggesting moderate-to-strong binding. Furthermore,
 several resonances corresponding to terminal phenanthroline ligand protons underwent large
 upfield shifts. NOESY spectra revealed many strong NOE interactions between the terminal
 ligands of the complex and minor groove sugar resonances, assisting the development of a binding model. The high selectivity of meso-[{Ru(phen)2}2(&#956;-ppz)]4+ for AT-rich regions of
 duplex DNA was confirmed using a restriction enzyme inhibition assay wherein the metal
 complex was found to interfere with the action of a restriction endonuclease that cuts doublestranded
 DNA at the center of a TATA sequence.
 
 The impressive selectivity inherent in many of these oligonucleotide-metal complex
 interactions has been exploited in the development of a DNA-based affinity chromatography
 technique for the highly efficient separation of different polypyridylruthenium(II) complexes,
 as well as the stereoisomers of individual complexes. Separations requiring effective column
 lengths in excess of 30 m on a cation-exchange column have been replicated using a column
 length of less than 5 cm. This technique has proven useful in qualitatively establishing relative
 binding affinities between complexes and a variety of oligonucleotides (duplex and nonduplex),
 and was one of the tools used to confirm the validity of the DAPI-modified fluorescent
 dye-displacement assay.
 
 These studies demonstrate the utility of this genre of rigid dinuclear metal complexes as
 sequence- and structure-selective probes of nucleic acids. Honing and targeting this selectivity
 to specific biologically-relevant targets through a rational choice of ligands, functionality and
 stereochemistry may potentially yield a new generation of more efficacious diagnostic and
 therapeutic agents.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2082/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2082/2/02Chapters1-3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2082/3/03Chapters4-6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2082/4/04Appendices.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of a long term exercise program on lower limb mobility in peripheral arterial disease patients</field><field name="creator">Crowther, Robert G.</field><field name="description">Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a chronic arterial occlusive disease of the lower extremities caused by atherosclerosis. The most common presenting symptom of PAD is intermittent claudication (IC) with exercise induced pain experienced in the calves, thighs or buttocks that is relieved with rest. Research investigating the effects of PAD-IC on lower limb mobility is limited to five studies on the temporal-spatial gait parameters (e.g. stride length, cadence, support times, speed) in PAD-IC populations that produced conflicting results. Gardner et al. (2001) speculated that the temporal-spatial gait parameters of individuals with PAD-IC could be improved by participation in exercise programs. To date there has been no attempt to determine the validity of this proposition. There has also been no research on the underlying mechanism of these temporal-spatial gait parameters namely gait kinematics (angular joint displacement, velocity and acceleration). Observed limitations in temporal-spatial gait parameters may be explained by the effects of musculoskeletal abnormalities on lower limb joint kinematics during the gait cycle. Understanding of the relationships between temporal-spatial gait parameters and gait kinematics in PAD-IC allows more precise identification of gait abnormality and its effects on lower limb mobility in this population. Analysis of variability in gait kinematics is becoming more commonly used as a clinical tool for evaluation of lower limb mobility in the elderly, lower limb disease populations and individual responses to exercise programs. Increased movement variability in lower limb kinematics has been traditionally associated with decreased movement performance due to disease and aging. However, more recent research from a dynamical systems perspective has indicated that movement variability may be of functional importance in motor control and may provide flexibility when adjusting to movement constraints imposed by disease.
 
 Therefore, for the purposes of this thesis, a series of studies were undertaken to investigate 1) the temporal-spatial gait parameters, gait kinematics, lower limb movement variability, walking performance, physiological responses to exercise and physical activity levels of individuals with and without PAD-IC and 2) the effects of a long term exercise program on these same variables in individuals with PAD-IC compared to individuals with and without PAD-IC.
 
 Study 1 (Chapter 3) examined the lower limb mobility characteristics (temporal-spatial gait parameters and gait kinematics) of individuals with PAD-IC and the relationships between lower limb mobility, walking performance, physiological responses to exercise and physical activity levels in this population. Study 2 (Chapters 4 &amp; 5) assessed intralimb joint coordination and single joint movement variability in patients with PAD-IC and without PAD-IC (CON). Lower limb mobility characteristics were determined via 2D motion analysis. A graded treadmill test was used to assess walking performance (pain free walking distance/time (PFWD/T) and maximal walking distance/time (MWD/T) and peak physiological responses to exercise (VO2peak, HRpeak, RERpeak and VEpeak). Physical activity levels were measured via a 7 d pedometer recording following motion analysis. Intralimb coordination variability was measured using parameterization, vector coding and normalized root mean square techniques applied to relative motion plots of various joint couplings. Single joint movement variability was measured using spanning set and coefficient of variation. Study 3 (Chapter 6) examined the effects of a 12 mth exercise program on the lower limb mobility of individuals with PAD-IC. A further aim was to examine the extent to which lower limb mobility contributes to long term exercise induced changes in walking performance, peak physiological responses to exercise and physical activity levels in PAD-IC patients. Finally study 4 (Chapter 7) investigated the effects of a 12 mth exercise program on walking performance and lower limb movement variability using intralimb joint coordination and single joint assessment techniques in individuals with and without PAD-IC. 
 
 Compared to CON, PAD-IC temporal-spatial gait parameters were significantly lower (P &lt; .05), except for single support ipsilateral limb time. PAD-IC participants spent a greater percentage of time in gait support phases, took longer to complete a stride and had reduced stride length and walking speeds during the gait cycle. Participants with PAD-IC joint angular kinematics showed significantly reduced displacement of ankle plantar flexion (P = .017), knee ROM (P = .021) and hip extension (P = .016) compared to the CON participants during the gait cycle. All joint minimum and maximum angular velocities and accelerations, physiological responses to exercise (walking) and physical activity levels were significantly lower for PAD-IC compared to the CON participants. The PAD-IC participants displayed significantly higher levels of lower limb movement variability in all joints when assessed using the intralimb joint coordination and single joint movement variability techniques. 
 
 The 12 mth exercise program had no significant effect on lower limb mobility, peak physiological responses to exercise or physical activity levels in PAD-IC patients who received normal medical therapy treatment and a 12 mth exercise program (TPAD-IC) compared to PAD-IC patients who received normal medical therapy (CPAD-IC) . However, the TPAD-IC participants demonstrated significantly greater walking performance (171% improvement in PFWT and 120% improvement in MWT) compared with baseline. The 12 mth supervised exercise program made no significant 
 impact on the lower limb movement variability of the TPAD-IC group as determined by either intralimb joint coordination or single joint analysis techniques.
 
 The results of these studies show that patients with PAD-IC have reduced lower limb mobility (temporal-spatial gait parameters and gait kinematics) and increased lower limb movement variability. The derived gait kinematics highlighted that the push-off (or toe-off) of the gait cycle in PAD-IC patients is significantly reduced compared to healthy age matched controls. The increased level of lower limb movement variability may be an adaptation to the gradual onset of claudication pain in this population. Patients with PAD-IC also demonstrated reduced walking performance, peak physiological responses to exercise and physical activity levels compared to healthy age matched controls. PAD-IC patients involved in a 12 mth supervised exercise program exhibited no change in lower limb mobility characteristics, physiological responses to exercise or physical activity levels. Gardner et al.&#8217;s (2001) speculation that the reduced temporal-spatial gait parameters of PAD-IC patients could be modified to resemble that of age matched controls through the use of an exercise program was not supported by the data. However, a 12 mth supervised exercise program did cause a significant improvement in walking performance in this population sample. It is suggested that the improvement in walking performance may be due at least in part, to adaptation of peripheral physiological mechanisms.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2110/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2110/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Controls of copper and gold distribution in the Kucing Liar deposit, Ertsberg mining district, West Papua, Indonesia</field><field name="creator">New, Brian T.E.</field><field name="description">Kucing Liar is a large sediment-hosted Cu-Au mineralized system containing some 15Moz of gold and
 5Mt of copper in ~500Mt of ore. It is situated in the Ertsberg Mining District in the Central Ranges of
 New Guinea, in the Indonesian province of West Papua. This study demonstrates that high sulphidation
 ore is continuous with typical porphyry-skarn style chalcopyrite ore and that both have formed from
 mixing of magmatic with meteoric waters within a zone of fault offset.
 
 Alteration and mineralization were localised within calcareous shale and thinly bedded limestone
 adjacent to the Grasberg Igneous Complex where they are zoned around fault offsets. Early phases of
 alteration are stratiform and are juxtaposed against the Idenberg Fault Zone, which has displaced host
 stratigraphy at least 600m vertically and possibly up to ~1,500m laterally. Four principal hydrothermal
 mineral associations are (1) calcic and magnesian skarn, (2) potassic assemblages including magnetite,
 (3) quartz-muscovite plus anhydrite and (4) locally massive pyrite. Cu and Au are associated with
 pyrite and occur discretely either as chalcopyrite &#177; bornite with an association of Cu-Au-Co (Zn-Pb) or
 as covellite &#177; enargite associated with Cu-Au (As-Sb-Hg). 40Ar/39Ar geochronology shows muscovite
 (3.18 &#177; 0.02Ma) was coeval with potassic-biotite assemblages (3.18 &#177; 0.02Ma and 3.20 &#177; 0.04Ma).
 Calcic and magnesian skarn were derived from magmatic fluids (_18OFLUID = 9-6&#8240;), while potassic and
 magnetite alteration were derived from high temperature (&gt;650&#176;C), high salinity (&gt;50wt%NaClEQUIV.)
 magmatic fluids (_18OFLUID = 6-12&#8240;). Quartz infill crystals associated with voluminous silicification
 contain a variety of fluid inclusions that range from moderate temperature (TH&lt;420&#176;C) high and
 moderate salinity brines (35-55 and 15-30wt%NaClEQUIV.), to low density - low salinity vapour-rich
 fluid inclusions. Fluorite-hosted inclusions with lower TH (&lt;300&#176;C) and salinity (~5wt%NaClEQUIV.) are
 also related to quartz alteration. Quartz alteration, muscovite and anhydrite have estimated _18OFLUID
 ranging from 0-6&#8240;. _D data from magnesian skarn suggest that the magma source was strongly but
 variably degassed during skarn formation while clustering of biotite and tremolite _D data may indicate
 ponding of fluids prior to exsolution, which was preceded by monzonite dyke emplacement that were
 emplaced during skarn and potassic stage alteration.
 
 Fluid infiltration was controlled by an active fault system characterised by strike-slip deformation
 overprinting a pre-existing reverse-slip fault. Periodic slip allowed infiltration of the magmatic fluids
 while a complex structural offset controlled the mixing of magmatic and meteoric fluids. Fluid mixing
 was augmented by phase separation which gave rise to brine and vapour-rich phases that migrated
 differently due to density contrasts. Ore deposition was related to mixing of magmatic and meteoric
 fluids, which resulted in an increase in H2S relative to SO2, causing intense sulphidation of magnetite
 and precipitation of sulphides, beginning with gold-rich chalcopyrite-dominant mineralization. High
 sulphidation covellite-style mineralization occurred by contraction of the vapour phase that had
 separated from quartz-forming brines. Au, As and Sb were partitioned away from the high sulphidation
 copper mineralization due to higher solubilities of these metals as bisulphide complexes and deposited
 in distal pyrite along with chloride-complexed Pb and Zn.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2083/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2083/2/02Chapter1-2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2083/3/03Chapter3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2083/4/04Chapter4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2083/5/05Chapter5-6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2083/6/06Chapter7-9.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2083/7/07ReferencesAppendices.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microstructural insights into the tectonic history of the southeastern New England Appalachians; porphyroblast-matrix structural analysis and insitu geochronology of rocks from the Merrimack Terrane, Connecticut and the Narragansett Basin, Rhode Island</field><field name="creator">Rich, Benjamin Heath</field><field name="description">Chapter 1
 Pennsylvanian age sediments within the Narragansett Basin allow the effects of Alleghanian deformation to be distinguished from the Taconic and Acadian orogenies that affected the rocks to the west. Three dimensional microstructural analyses of both matrix foliations and structures preserved in porphyroblasts define two extended periods of deformation and metamorphism about two differently trending foliation intersection/ inflection axes in porphyroblasts (FIAs). SSW-NNE trending FIAs (Set 1) formed first followed by WSW-ENE trending FIAs (Set 2). The SSW-NNE FIA trends from the south-central zone lie parallel to regional folds in the entire southern graben. The changes in FIA trends reveal that the direction of maximum bulk shortening changed from WNW-ESE to NNW-SSE during amphibolite facies metamorphism within the Central Zone of the basin. They reveal a more varied history than the simple kinematic framework of solely W-E directed bulk shortening that was previously suggested.
 
 Chapter 2
 Foliation intersection/inflection axes preserved in porphyroblasts (FIAs), from the Rhode Island Formation in the central zone of the Narragansett Basin, have two distinct trends oriented NNE and ENE. Both trends occur in some samples and reveal a consistent succession from NNE to ENE. Each FIA trend is defined by asymmetric curved inclusion trails that in every case have an anticlockwise asymmetry looking NE. The two distinct trends and their consistent relative timing cannot be explained if the porphyroblasts had rotated. Therefore, a deformation history of progressive bulk inhomogeneous shortening with a consistent non-coaxial component of shear of top to the WNW followed by top to the NNW is required. This correlates with the macroscopic regional relationships suggested by the folds which verge WNW and provides a convincing demonstration that shear on cleavage corresponds with the differentiation asymmetry (curvature of a crenulated cleavage into differentiated crenulation cleavage).
 
 Chapter 3
 High grade Pennsylvanian metamorphism appears pervasive throughout the Scotland Schist of the Merrimack Terrane in SE New England. This contrasts with previous work that suggested post-Acadian metamorphism within the cover sequence was limited to narrow fault controlled zones. A three dimensional microstructural analysis of both matrix foliations and structures preserved in porphyroblasts defined four periods of deformation and metamorphism about differently trending foliation/ inflection axes in porphyroblasts (FIAs). FIA sets 1 to 4 are oriented WNW-ESE, SW-NE, NNW-SSE and WNW-ESE, respectively. The SSW-NNE, NW-SE, WSW-ENE and SSW-NNE directions of bulk shortening that accompanied the development of this succession of FIA sets produced dominantly non-coaxial deformation in the rocks. NNE directed bulk orogenic flow accompanied high grade metamorphism during the earliest determined period of porphyroblast growth whereas WSW to NNE directed bulk orogenic flow accompanied high grade Pennsylvanian (310 Ma) metamorphism. Consistent NNE to WSW directed bulk orogenic flow in eastern Connecticut and southwest Rhode Island is not compatible with current models for loading of the Bronson Hill -Central Maine -Merrimack terranes by stacking thrust nappes towards the S and E.
 
 Chapter 4
 Late Palaeozoic U-Th-Pb ages of monazite from rocks of the Merrimack Terrane in eastern Connecticut reflect an Alleghanian overprint on Acadian metamorphic rocks. The period of monazite growth was dated using an electron microprobe and has identified high grade metamorphism occurring in association with compressional deformation at 311 &#177; 3 Ma. High grade metamorphism was not restricted to shear controlled zones but affected the bulk of the vertical rock pile within the Merrimack Terrane during the Pennsylvanian. However, the late Alleghanian (Permian) deformation and metamorphism that affected the Narragansett Basin to the east had no impact on the Merrimack Terrane. This is strongly supported by the lack of correlation between the FIA sets for the two regions. As metamorphism increased to sillimanite grade within the Merrimack Terrane, deformation became increasingly coarsely partitioned until the Early Permian when the strain became localised along ductile shear zones at the Putnam-Avalon boundary. That is, collision related compressional deformation within the Narragansett Basin was partitioned entirely into the Honey Hill fault system during the early Permian.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2084/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2084/2/02Volume1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2084/3/03Vol2Chapters1-3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2084/4/04Vol2Chapters4-8.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mass transport evaluation using consolidated VHF Radar and Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler data</field><field name="creator">Page, Geoff</field><field name="description">In this study, a PortMap Ocean Surface Current Radar operating in the VHF
 band was used in conjunction with a seabed mounted Acoustic Doppler Current
 Profiler to obtain measurements of current velocity through the Lido channel to
 the Venice Lagoon. Current flow data were obtained over a six week period
 from both instruments. These data, together with additional data obtained from
 tide gauges and wind speed data from weather stations have been used to
 develop techniques for producing the measurements required to obtain the
 mass transport of water through the inlet.
 
 The combination of data from these two different instruments was used to
 overcome the limitations of each technology in obtaining a complete estimation
 of mass transport through the inlet. Seabed mounted ADCPs only provide
 current measurements for a single geographical point, and are unable to
 measure the surface current due to side-lobe ringing within a few metres of the
 surface. It is for this reason that a second technology, the surface current radar
 was used to measure the current across the surface of the channel. For the
 PortMap Ocean Surface Current Radar operating in the VHF Band (152.2 MHz)
 this represents a depth weighted average measurement in the upper 15.7 cm of
 the water column.
 
 The PortMap radar systems used in Venice produced data that were generally
 of a very poor signal-to-noise ratio. This was determined to be caused by a
 hardware fault present in the PortMap radar affecting the range resolution.
 Although this resulted in insufficient radar coverage of the channel required to
 produce an evaluation of mass transport, techniques were developed to
 produce the secondary data required for this purpose. The analysis software
 was modified to reflect the change in range resolution, enabling high resolution,
 short-range current vector maps to be produced for the regions surrounding
 each radar station.
 
 During the deployment, a turbid water plume was observed entering on the
 Sabbioni side of the inlet while the tide continued to ebb on the Lido side of the
 inlet. The high resolution vector current maps produced were sufficient to
 observe this interesting current dynamic. These measurements show that
 during an outgoing tide with a strong ebb tidal stream on the Lido side of the
 channel, water begins to flow into the channel on the Sabbioni side of the
 channel. This current dynamic has obvious implications for the transport of
 sediment from the neighbouring Cavallino beach into the inlet, and into the
 Venice Lagoon.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2085/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2085/2/02Chapters1-4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2085/3/03Chapter5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2085/4/04Chapters6-7.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2085/5/05Bibliography.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anthelmintic effects of tropical shrub legumes in ruminant animals</field><field name="creator">Cresswell, Keryn J.</field><field name="description">Gastrointestinal (GI) nematode parasitism causes major economic losses and animal
 health problems in farmed livestock and thus poses a serious challenge to livestock
 production worldwide. Parasite control strategies historically have relied heavily on
 anthelmintic drenches, but with the emergence of anthelmintic resistance, new
 strategies are required. A number of forage species containing high concentrations of
 condensed tannins have been shown to have anthelmintic properties. The aim of the
 current study was to determine whether selected tropical legumes used as protein
 supplements for livestock, and in particular Calliandra calothyrsus, might also be
 useful for the control of GI nematode parasites.
 
 A pilot study was undertaken initially to determine the effects of Calliandra, when
 fed to lambs as a sole diet, on burdens of Haemonchus contortus or Trichostrongylus
 colubriformis and on egg production by adult worms. Lucerne (Medicago sativa)
 pellets were used as a high protein control diet and Mitchell grass (Astrebla species)
 hay was used as a low protein control diet. The effects of diet on the worms were
 assessed by faecal egg counts and post-mortem worm counts. Worm burdens of each
 species and egg production by H. contortus were similar in lambs on all three diets.
 However, egg production of T. colubriformis was reduced by 85-90 % by feeding
 Calliandra to the host lambs and the number of eggs in utero of female
 T. colubriformis was significantly increased.
 
 These results were confirmed and extended in a larger-scale feeding experiment, in
 which the Mitchell grass diet was omitted. A number of haematological parameters
 were measured to examine the nutritional status, resistance and resilience of the host
 lambs in response to the worm burdens. Because pH was expected to affect the
 ability of condensed tannins to bind to worms, the pH was recorded immediately
 after slaughter in each segment of the GI tract to examine the relationship between
 pH and faecal egg counts. Worm burdens of H. contortus were similar in lambs fed
 Calliandra (2237 &#177; 395 worms) and lucerne (1861 &#177; 230 worms). Worm burdens of
 T. colubriformis were also similar in lambs fed Calliandra (5718 &#177; 339 worms) and
 vii
 lucerne (4861 &#177; 452 worms). However, egg production by both H. contortus and
 T. colubriformis were reduced by 64-84 % and 24-68 % respectively. There were no
 improvements in any of the haematological parameters measured attributable to the
 different diets, indicating that reduced egg counts were due to a direct toxic effect of
 the Calliandra diet and not due to improved resistance or resilience to the worms.
 The variation in pH in each of the GI segments was too small to identify any
 relationship between pH and reduced egg output by female worms.
 
 A study was then conducted to confirm that the anthelmintic effects of Calliandra
 were due to the condensed tannins in the plant. Condensed tannins were extracted
 and purified from Calliandra leaves and incubated with H. contortus and T.
 colubriformis eggs and larvae in in vitro assays. Egg hatch and larval development
 rates were determined. Calliandra tannins delayed hatching and reduced egg hatch
 and larval development in both species. Development of infective larvae was almost
 completely inhibited at tannin concentrations above 300 &#956;g/mL.
 
 In vitro assays were also used to screen a number of other tropical legumes for
 anthelmintic activity. Crude extracts of nine legume species, including Calliandra
 and lucerne pellets, and two different fractions of purified Calliandra were incubated
 with H. contortus and T. colubriformis eggs and larvae. In addition to Calliandra,
 Leucaena leucocephala and Desmanthus virgatus were identified as having possible
 anthelmintic activity against nematode eggs and larvae. The two Calliandra fractions
 both had similar anthelmintic activity to the Calliandra crude extract.
 
 In an attempt to determine the mode of action of Calliandra condensed tannins
 against GI nematodes, a staining technique was developed to identify tannins
 histologically in mammalian and nematode tissues. Haematoxylin &amp; Eosin (H&amp;E),
 ferric chloride, butanol-H2SO4 and vanillin-HCl techniques were examined, initially
 using plant tissues, and then optimised for use in mammalian tissues. The H &amp;E and
 vanillin-HCl techniques were then used to stain GI tissues and nematodes obtained
 from Calliandra-fed lambs. In the ovine GI tissue, condensed tannins were present in
 the lumen and in macrophages and giant cells in the lamina propria, particularly in
 the abomasum. Condensed tannins were observed on the outside of the cuticle of
 intact adult H. contortus and T. colubriformis, mainly in adherent digesta. Condensed
 tannins were also observed in the pharynx and intestine of sectioned H. contortus,
 but no condensed tannins were observed in the reproductive tract.
 A final experiment was conducted to determine the effects of Calliandra on the
 development, establishment and reproductive capacity of nematodes derived from
 eggs exposed to the legume in the host diet but with no subsequent exposure as
 adults. Eggs of H. contortus and T. colubriformis obtained from Calliandra-fed or
 lucerne-fed donor lambs were cultured in vitro to obtain infective larvae, which were
 used to infect groups of recipient lambs. Worm egg and larval production from the
 donor lambs, and adult worm egg output and worm burdens of the recipient lambs,
 were monitored. Although worm egg production and larval production from the
 donor lambs was reduced by the Calliandra diet, the ratio of eggs to larvae was also
 reduced. It was not clear whether this was due to problems with the experimental
 technique or to selection pressure exerted on the worms by the Calliandra diet.
 Worm burdens were higher in the recipient lambs receiving larvae from the
 Calliandra-fed donors. Egg production by the female worms derived from
 Calliandra-fed donors may have been reduced, but the results were not clear.
 
 Calliandra, in addition to its value as a source of protein for tropical livestock, may
 be useful in reducing egg production by GI parasitic nematodes, thus reducing larval
 contamination of tropical pastures and infection rates of livestock. Calliandra
 therefore has potential as an anthelmintic alternative in tropical regions.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2086/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2086/2/02Chapters1-5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2086/3/03Chapters6-9pdf.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2086/4/04References.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The application of telepharmacy as an enabling technology to facilitate the provision of quality pharmaceutical services to rural and remote areas of Australia</field><field name="creator">Kimber, Michael B.</field><field name="description">The provision of quality pharmacy services to rural and remote communities is influenced by the
 National Strategy for the Quality Use of Medicines. The implementation of National Medicines Policy
 is challenged by the shortage of pharmacists in rural areas. Australia compares unfavourably with both
 the United Kingdom and the USA in this regard. The study by the Department of Employment and
 Workplace Relations in 2002 identified that there is a severe shortage of hospital pharmacists in New
 South Wales and acute shortages of community pharmacists in Queensland regional areas.
 
 Although the lack of a telecommunications infrastructure has been a major impediment to the
 extension of telehealth into rural Australia, the challenge of delivering pharmaceutical services into
 rural areas may be augmented by the provision of telepharmacy applications such as remote
 dispensing of medications, counselling and implementing medication reviews by video conferencing.
 
 The aims of this thesis were to ascertain the opinions of relevant healthcare professionals to the
 concepts of telepharmacy; to identify the requirements of a telepharmacy system suitable for use in
 rural Australia; to develop a pilot telepharmacy system and to demonstrate the system by dispensing a
 limited range of products locally and then remotely via telecommunications. Thereafter, to identify an
 area of telepharmacy where there is a clinical need and to demonstrate the applicability of
 telepharmacy by means of a trial involving volunteer patients.
 
 This study initially involved interviewing healthcare workers in northern Queensland, the Tiwi
 Islands, and the western coast of Tasmania to assess the receptiveness, requirements and potential for
 telepharmacy applications in rural and remote regions in Australia.
 
 Thereafter a comprehensive literature search on telepharmacy applications was conducted with a view
 to identifying suitable equipment for use in rural Australia. Whilst the search revealed a number of
 examples of commercial telepharmacy applications in the USA and Europe, none met all of the
 defined criteria for an ideal rural Australian telepharmacy system.
 
 Accordingly, two pilot telepharmacy systems were developed and constructed, based upon the
 identified criteria. For remote controlled operations under video supervision, the criteria for a
 telepharmacy application were defined as:
 &#8226; a system capable of storing a range of individual medications to suit the intended application;
 &#8226; a standard commercial dispensary computer program;
 &#8226; an automated method of removing individual packs from the storage unit;
 &#8226; an image acquisition device to capture and store a picture of the dispensed pack, and
 &#8226; a bar code reader to record the bar code of the dispensed product.
 
 In addition, video conferencing capability was required to enable the remote pharmacist to provide
 counselling and medication review services to the patient.
 
 Four trials were conducted using the constructed pilot telepharmacy equipment to demonstrate the
 validity, accuracy and reliability of the systems in dispensing a limited range of products locally and
 then remotely via telecommunications. These studies adequately demonstrated the operation of the
 telepharmacy dispensing systems and identified the requirement for a different design of bar code
 reader in any further trials. These studies also identified that the inclusion of video conferencing in a
 single remote telepharmacy application was not the optimum solution and that a separate video
 conferencing unit was required. A simple system of quality assurance, incorporating a dispensed pack
 image acquisition and bar code verification was also demonstrated, resulting in the addition of a
 significant patient safety factor to mitigate dispensing errors.
 
 In order to ascertain the level of support for the concept of telepharmacy and its potential applications,
 four key healthcare professional groups in rural northern Australia were surveyed. Pharmacists and
 medical practitioners were surveyed by post and the nurse group was surveyed at the 2006 Royal
 College of Nursing annual conference in Cairns. The nurse/healthcare group was an online Internet
 survey, advertised in the Nursing Careers and Allied Health booklet published in June 2006. The
 major findings were that 87 per cent of all the healthcare respondents supported the use of
 telepharmacy to provide professional pharmaceutical services to rural and remote areas of Australia.
 The study did, however, identify that 70 per cent of the pharmacist group surveyed were not
 supportive, or neutral to, the use of remotely operated automated dispensing equipment as a
 telepharmacy application in rural areas, when the local pharmacy was closed. The pharmacist group
 were also not supportive of the use of such equipment in remote areas where there was no community
 pharmacy (58 per cent disagreed or were neutral). These results were further analysed and revealed
 that the younger pharmacist age group (less than 10 years experience), were in favour of the use of the
 automated dispensing equipment as a telepharmacy application, where there was no community
 pharmacy, compared to the older pharmacist group (P&lt; 0.05).
 
 Medication reviews are a key objective of the Fourth Community Pharmacy Agreement and are
 provided as a fee for service basis for face to face reviews conducted in the home. They were
 identified in the surveys as a clinical need which may be solved by a telepharmacy application due to
 the difficulty and expensive of providing medication reviews to patients in rural and remote areas.
 
 A pilot study involving volunteer patients was conducted to demonstrate the use of a telepharmacy
 application in conducting medication reviews. The study recruited nine patients and the medication
 reviews were conducted by an accredited pharmacist via a local area wireless network, equivalent to a
 Broadband Internet connection. The telepharmacy interviews were recorded and provided valuable
 information for the pharmacist preparing the medication management reports. The patients were asked
 to complete a customer satisfaction questionnaire on conclusion of the video conference. Six of the
 patients rated the overall telepharmacy experience as excellent and three rated the experience as very
 good.
 
 Whilst not removing, or negating, the need for personal professional pharmacy services, there are
 many potential benefits for telepharmacy applications directed at rural communities. However, it is
 important that it includes and retains the active role of the pharmacist in the delivery of pharmacy
 services to achieve the highest quality of care for rural communities and for the safety, and welfare of
 the public related to the use of pharmaceuticals. Pharmacist involvement is essential for patient
 counselling and medication reviews, with their exclusion increasing risks to the patient and leading to
 a higher incidence of medication errors, adverse events, and excessive drug costs. The study has thus
 provided evidence that telepharmacy applications may potentially lead to unique and innovative ways
 to deliver quality pharmacy services to rural and remote areas.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2087/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2087/2/02Chapters1-5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2087/3/03Chapters6-8.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2087/4/04ReferencesAppendices.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular and genetic analysis of Drosophila Rad21: a gene and protein involved in sister chromatid cohesion</field><field name="creator">Keall, Rebecca M.</field><field name="description">The accurate and efficient dissemination of replicated chromosomes into daughter
 cells is fundamental to all aspects of biology. Chromosomal missegregation can lead
 to aneuploid chromosome configurations which are a hallmark of cancer cells and
 also a leading cause of birth defects and infertility in humans. Given that
 chromosome missegregation can result in such disastrous consequences, cells have
 evolved mechanisms to ensure the faithful segregation of chromosomes, one of
 which is sister-chromatid cohesion which is mediated by the cohesin complex.
 
 Cohesin is a multi-protein complex thought to be the primary effector of sister
 chromatid cohesion in all eukaryotes. In yeast, cohesin is loaded onto chromosome
 arms in S-phase where it maintains sister chromatid cohesion until the metaphaseanaphase
 transition. Sister chromatid separation is then triggered by the site-specific
 cleavage of the RAD21 cohesin subunit. In metazoan species, including Drosophila,
 the bulk of cohesin dissociates form chromosomes in prophase, leaving a minor pool
 of centromere-associated cohesin to maintain sister-chromatid cohesion until
 anaphase. Exactly how the various cohesin subunits and their regulators orchestrate
 these events has yet to be fully elucidated. Meiotic cohesin complexes are subjected
 to additional levels of regulation to accommodate the different types of cell division
 that occur to produce haploid gametes. In humans, premature loss of meiotic sister
 chromatid cohesion has been proposed as the most likely molecular cause for
 sporadic aneuploidy linked to advanced maternal age.
 
 The results presented in this thesis begin with a description of the rationale and
 approach used to identify the DRAD21 separase cleavage sites, and subsequently
 mutate them using site-directed mutagenesis. Characterisation of the dominant
 alleles generated is described, as is the first evidence of DRAD21 proteolysis. The
 over expression of non-cleavable DRAD21 isoforms was investigated in a range of
 different tissues and developmental stages, and was shown to dominantly reduce the
 size of adult tissue. These data suggested that overexpression of non-cleavable
 isoforms of DRAD21 in dividing cells increased levels of cell death. Analysis of the
 cellular effects of non-cleavable DRAD21 overexpression in the developing eye
 imaginal disc confirmed that the level of apoptosis was increased in cells expressing
 non-cleavable DRAD21, and that this DRAD21 isoform induced mitotic delay or
 arrest, consistent with a defect in mitotic progression. This is the first description of
 a Drad21 mutant phenotype. The reduced and roughened eye phenotype generated
 as a result of non-cleavable DRAD21 expression in the eye imaginal discs provided a
 tool to use in genetic studies of DRAD21 function.
 
 Genetic analysis showed that known and predicted cohesin regulators are capable of
 modulating the DRAD21 eye phenotype, therefore establishing the suitability of this
 phenotype for use in a genetic screen. The entire Drosophila genome was screened
 for genetic modifiers of the DRAD21 eye phenotype. In total 62 interacting genomic
 regions were identified, spanning chromosomes two, three and four. Analysis of
 these interactions revealed both enhancers and suppressors of the DRAD21 eye
 phenotype, and genetic dissection of some of the interacting regions allowed 13
 modifier loci to be unequivocally identified at the molecular level. Specifically, ten
 distinct interacting regions were examined at the molecular level and ten suppressor
 loci and three enhancer loci were identified and a mechanism by which these
 interactions may be occurring was proposed for each.
 
 These studies are likely to significantly influence our current understanding of
 metazoan chromosome dynamics and identify novel regulators of chromosome
 segregation. To date, some interacting loci identified at the molecular level have
 established roles in chromosome cohesion, while for others this study provides the
 first evidence for their role in this process. These studies will identify both novel
 regulators of chromosome segregation and hopefully provide a shortlist of genes that
 when functionally impaired may incrementally increase the risk of chromosome
 missegregation and aneuploidy in humans.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2088/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2088/2/02Chapters1-4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2088/3/03Chapters5-6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2088/4/04BibliographyAppendices.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The lymphoid organ in penaeids and it&#8217;s interaction with moulting</field><field name="creator">Rusaini,</field><field name="description">Prawn immunity is still a mysterious puzzle in immunology. However, this knowledge is important in culture management in order to avoid the devastating impact of infectious pathogens and economic losses. Furthermore, since the effectiveness of vaccination and immunostimulants is unclear, the enhancement of immune capability of prawns might provide a bright light to this industry. Therefore, the objective of this thesis was to develop a simple modified method of quantifying the histopathological changes of a component of the lymphoid organ (LO), the spheroid cells, and apply this technique in a study of the influence of moult cycle, lunar rhythm, and viral infections on spheroid cells quantification.
 
 Moult cycles of P. monodon were studied by using setal development (setogenesis) and retraction of epidermis from the setal bases (apolysis) in the inner uropod adjacent to the telson tip. Five stages and four substages of the moult i.e. postmoult (stage A and B), intermoult (stage C), and premoult (stage D0, D1, D2 and D3/D4) and ecdysis (stage E) could be determined by applying these two criteria. However, unsynchronised development of these two criteria in abnormal prawns led to the difficulties in differentiating between stage B, C and D.
 
 A modified transect technique seemed to offer a simple, rapid, and accurate method in analysing the abundance of spheroid cells in the lymphoid organ. Furthermore, one half longitudinal section of the cephalothorax represented the abundance of the spheroid cells in the lymphoid organ of penaeid prawns. Based on this technique, the fluctuation of the lymphoid organ spheroid (LOS) cells during the life of P.monodon was investigated. It was found that animal size (weight and total length) had no significant effect (P &gt; 0.05; ANOVA) on the spheroid to total tissue (STT) ratio, the prevalence of vacuolated spheroids and the number of vacuoles in the spheroid cells.
 
 Unfortunately, the cyclic phenomena of the prawn&#8217;s, moult cycle also showed no significant effect on any measure of spheroid cells (P &gt; 0.05) rejecting the original hypothesis of this work. The effect of the prawn&#8217;s sex was variably related to the spheroid cells during the experiments. In the first two trials (Chapter 5 and 6), evidently sex had no significant effect on any measure of spheroid cells (P &gt; 0.05).
 However, in the last experiment (Chapter 7) female bias on the ratio of STT was obvious (P &lt; 0.05).
 
 Lunar related patterns on the spheroid to total tissue ratio were evident during the experiments. It was found that the STT ratio was significantly lower at new moon than first quarter and full moons (P &lt; 0.05). This indicated that increased activity of the prawns during the dark moon enhanced immunocompetence of the prawns to eliminate viral diseases. Moreover, apparently, the STT ratio of GAV-injected prawns was significantly higher than control prawns (P &lt; 0.05). Together with this, the presence of distinct bacterial granulomas in the lymphoid organ implied that the formation of the spheroid cells in the haemal sinuses of the lymphoid organ was only associated with viral diseases not with bacterial infections.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2089/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2089/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recruitment in time and space: the dynamics and distributions of reef fish populations on a low latitude coral reef</field><field name="creator">Srinivasan, Maya</field><field name="description">Most benthic marine fishes have a pelagic larval stage, which after
 metamorphosis, recruits into adult habitat. Recruitment is known to play a major
 role in determining the dynamics and spatial distribution of coral reef fish
 populations. Temporal and spatial patterns in recruitment can arise through
 variation in larval supply, habitat selection and/or the availability of suitable
 recruitment habitat. Most of the work demonstrating the importance of
 recruitment on coral reefs has been carried out at high-latitude, seasonal locations,
 where reproduction and subsequent recruitment occur over a restricted period.
 Theory predicts a more continuous larval supply near the equator, and because of
 greater fish species diversity, a higher level of specialisation and dependence on
 habitat characteristics. However, very few studies have examined recruitment
 patterns, habitat degradation and the consequences for reef populations at low
 latitudes.
 
 The primary goal of this thesis was to extend our knowledge of the causes and
 consequences of temporal and spatial patterns in reef fish recruitment to a low
 latitude coral reef in the Indo-Pacific (Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea, 5o30&#8217;S;
 150o05&#8217;E). Specifically, the chapters set out to examine: (1) temporal patterns in
 recruitment, with particular emphasis on describing extended recruitment periods
 and underlying processes affecting recruitment periodicity; (2) spatial patterns in
 recruitment, with particular emphasis on microhabitat specialisation and the role
 of microhabitat availability in determining reef-wide patterns in recruitment; (3)
 the underlying mechanisms responsible for establishing and reinforcing distinct
 narrow depth distributions in the recruitment of reef fishes in this region; and (4)
 the influence of recruitment patterns on the temporal dynamics and spatial
 distributions of adult fish populations against a background of declining coral reef
 health.
 
 Coral reefs in Kimbe Bay are subject to a monsoon climate, with distinct wet 
 (November-February) and windy (April-June) seasons, and annual temperature
 deviations of just 1-2oC. Due to the lack of variation in temperature, I predicted
 that most fish species would reproduce and recruit year-round (Chapter 2). To
 test this I carried out quantitative surveys of new recruits of all abundant, noncryptic
 reef fishes every 1-2 months on inshore reefs over a 2.5-year period
 (December 1998 to April 2001). For the vast majority of species, new recruits
 were present during most months of the year, with damselfishes (Pomacentridae)
 and wrasses (Labridae) accounting for 90% of all new recruits observed. The
 majority of wrasse species exhibited year-round recruitment with broad peaks
 from November to May, while most damselfish species had negligible recruitment
 during the wet season (December-February), followed by one or two broad
 recruitment peaks between May and November. Species with year-round
 recruitment exhibited the highest cumulative recruit abundances. The
 reproductive output of three damselfish species was monitored for just over a
 year, and it was found that reproduction occurred throughout the year, even during
 the wet season. Although reproductive output decreased during the wet season,
 this was not considered sufficient to explain the lower recruitment of these species
 during this time. I argue that the lack of damselfish recruitment during the wet
 season is due to both decreased reproductive output and increased mortality of
 larvae, possibly due to hypo-saline conditions in surface waters. These results
 indicate that consistent family-wide recruitment strategies that may play a
 significant role in the dynamics of populations at low latitudes.
 
 As a consequence of high fish diversity and steep reef profiles in Kimbe Bay, I
 predicted a high level of specialisation on settlement substrata that would be a
 major determinant of the spatial distribution and abundance of recruits (Chapter
 3). Recruitment surveys were carried out using a spatially structured sampling
 design to determine differences in abundance among reefs located different
 distances from shore, among depths and reef zones within reefs (macrohabitats),
 as well as among different recruitment substrata (microhabitats). The
 microhabitats used by new recruits were recorded and compared with
 microhabitat availability from annual benthic surveys carried out at the same sites
 and depths. Over half the common species (23 out of 38) occupied corals in the
 family Acroporidae in proportions greater than expected based on their
 availability, and 12 species preferentially occupied non-living substrata (i.e. bare
 rock, rubble and sand). There were only five species, two damselfishes and three
 wrasses, which used all 13 microhabitat categories. At both the family-level (for
 damselfishes and wrasses) and the species-level, depth explained the greatest
 percentage of the variance in the spatial recruitment data (just under 50% on
 average) and microhabitat availability explained the lowest. Therefore, although
 the level of microhabitat specialisation suggests that microhabitat availability
 might be an important factor in determining recruitment patterns, in terms of
 spatial patterns, the region is primarily characterised by a strong depth gradient.
 
 A number of potentially important factors co-vary down a depth gradient. To determine whether the narrow depth range of new recruits was determined by the
 depth distribution of preferred microhabitats or depth itself, I conducted further
 surveys at additional depths on two reefs, in combination with a field experiment,
 using patch reefs composed of identical coral substrata at the same five depths (3,
 6, 10, 15 and 20 m). Settlement patterns from the patch reef experiment were
 compared to those on un-manipulated reef habitat (i.e. patterns from surveys), to
 determine whether new settlers have preferences for particular depths,
 independent of microhabitat structure. For all species, settlement on patch reefs
 differed significantly among depths despite uniform substratum composition,
 indicating that depth preferences are largely independent of microhabitat
 structure. For four of the six species tested, depth-related settlement patterns on
 un-manipulated habitat and on patch reefs did not differ. For the other two
 species, depth ranges were greater on the patch reefs than on un-manipulated
 habitat. A second experiment examined whether depth preferences reflected
 variation in growth and survival when microhabitat was similar. Newly settled
 individuals of Chrysiptera parasema and Dascyllus melanurus were placed,
 separately, on patch reefs at five depths (as above) and their survival and growth
 monitored. For D. melanurus, which is restricted to shallow depths, both survival
 and growth were highest at the shallowest depth. Depth did not affect either
 survival or growth of C. parasema, which has a broader depth range than D.
 melanurus (between 6 and 15 m). This suggests that the stronger the depth
 preference, the greater the fitness costs incurred by settling at the extremes of, or
 outside, a preferred depth range.
 
 The final aim of this project was to determine how temporal and spatial
 recruitment patterns influence adult fish populations. The temporal surveys of
 new recruits were conducted during a time of a dramatic decline in coral cover
 caused by a series of bleaching events and change in fish communities.
 Associated with this, 75% of the common reef fish species declined in abundance,
 with 50% declining to less than half their original numbers. Wrasses exhibited the
 greatest range of responses, including species that increased, species that declined
 and others that remained stable. The majority of damselfish species declined and
 the magnitude of declines were greater than for most wrasses. The magnitude and
 direction of the long-term change in fish abundance was inversely correlated with
 the degree of association between recruits and live branching corals. Species that
 did not recruit into live coral tended to increase in abundance, while the greater
 the dependence of recruits on live coral, the greater the adult decline. For many
 species, long-term trends in adult numbers were interrupted by a spike of
 increased abundance in 2001, which was associated with high recruitment the
 previous year. Spatial patterns in the abundance of adults across reefs and depths
 were positively correlated with recruitment levels for 80% of the species
 examined. For some species, adult distributions tended to be more even than
 recruit distributions, indicating post-settlement expansion in distributions. A
 comparison of recruit-adult relationships among species and families established
 that a given average density of recruits resulted in greater average densities of
 adult damselfishes, compared with wrasses. Within each family, species with
 higher recruitment exhibited higher adult densities, but the magnitude of the
 increase in adult numbers declined as a function of increasing recruitment. I
 suggest that short-term fluctuations in adult abundance arise through fluctuations
 in larval supply, while longer-term trends reflect a combination of changes in
 habitat availability, habitat-limited recruitment and adult survival. In contrast,
 adult spatial distributions are primarily explained by strong habitat-specific
 settlement preferences.
 
 This first study of coral reef fish recruitment in Papua New Guinea confirms that
 recruitment is a major determinant of the dynamics and spatial distribution of
 adult fishes in this high diversity region. While extended recruitment seasons
 clearly influence short-term population dynamics, longer-term trends in
 population size appear to be driven by habitat-limited recruitment and habitat
 change. Spatial gradients indicate a high level of specialisation with regard to 
 depth and dependence on live coral as recruitment microhabitat. Documenting
 variation in spatial and temporal dynamics has also revealed a number of
 previously unknown family-wide and species-specific themes. The family-level
 differences between damselfish and wrasses may reflect fundamental differences
 in their life history traits, reliance on living corals and the carrying capacities of
 their habitats. Greater attention to variation in recruitment dynamics along
 biodiversity and biogeographic gradients will be required to understand and
 respond to the impacts of global change on coral reef fish populations.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2090/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2090/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biomimetic fouling control</field><field name="creator">Scardino, Andrew J.</field><field name="description">Any man-made structure immersed in the marine environment rapidly becomes fouled, with significant economic consequences. Solutions to fouling have generally used toxic paints or coatings which have damaging effects on marine life. The subsequent phasing out of these antifoulants has sparked a search for non-toxic antifouling alternatives, including the development of technologies based on natural biofouling defence models (biomimicry). The biomimetic approach to antifouling is the focus of this thesis, with an emphasis on physical fouling defence mechanisms in molluscs. Surface microtextures have been identified as potential fouling deterrent mechanisms in molluscs and have been recorded on the blue mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis and M. edulis. The aim of this thesis is to develop biomimetic fouling control using marine molluscs as a natural model.
 
 To determine physical defences the surface texture of a range of marine bivalves and gastropods from the Great Barrier Reef was characterised and many unique micro-topographical patterns discovered. Laser scanning confocal microscopy was used to quantify the surface roughness parameters for 36 selected species. This is the first example of the characterisation of natural marine surfaces in terms of mean roughness and waviness profiles, skewness, anisotropy and fractal dimension. The wettability of the selected species was also determined. Subsequently, the 36 species were assessed for fouling resistance over three months and fouling resistance and removal was correlated with the surface roughness parameters generated. Key roughness parameters, in particular skewness, fractal dimension and hydrophobicity, were identified for species specific fouling resistance and also fouling removal. Total fouling cover was positively correlated to fractal dimension and negatively correlated to skewness. Algal cover was negatively correlated to hydrophobicity, Spirorbid tubeworm cover was positively correlated to fractal dimension, and percent fouling removal was positively correlated with mean waviness.
 
 To establish the role of surface microtexture in fouling deterrence, biomimics were created for three bivalves, Mytilus galloprovincialis and Tellina plicata, which have differing microtopographical patterns, and Amusium balloti, which has a smooth surface. Smooth biomimics were significantly more fouled than microtextured biomimics. The fouling resistance of microtextured biomimics diminished after 6-8 weeks, in contrast to natural shells which maintained their fouling resistant properties for 3 months. The extended fouling resistance of natural shells supports a multiple defence strategy of the surface-bound periostracum, with the proteinaceous nature of the coating providing a defence against microfouling. A theory is proposed that microtextured biomimics only deters macrofouling larvae and that microfoulers that are smaller than the size of the microtexture fill the textures and negate its effects.
 
 This theory is termed &#8216;attachment point theory&#8217;, whereby larval attachment is influenced by the number of attachment points with settling larvae preferring the maximum number of attachment points to enhance successful adhesion and recruitment. To test attachment point theory, microtextured films of varying texture widths (2-512 &#956;m) were developed and attachment to the microtextures by a range of micro- and macro-fouling organisms was determined. Diatoms attached in significantly higher numbers on textures smaller than the width of the diatom cell. In contrast attachment was reduced on textures slightly smaller than the cell width, clearly supporting attachment point theory. Attachment by macrofouling larvae and algal spores to microtextures also supported the theory. Larvae and spores generally settled in higher number on the texture larger than the spore/larval size. Attachment points for settling larvae are identified as important mechanisms in fouling deterrence, or attachment, with the critical factor being the ratio of the width of settling organism to that of the microtexture.
 
 The findings of fouling resistance on micro-rough surfaces were explored further to incorporate nano-scale surface roughness. This novel antifouling mechanism combines micro- and nano-scale roughness to a hydrophobic surface to create superhydrophobicity. A range of surfaces incorporating micro- with nano-scale roughness, and nano-scale roughness alone, were tested against a range of micro- and macro- fouling organisms. Nano-rough surfaces alone significantly deterred all tested organisms. In contrast micro-scale with nano-scale roughness either attracted or repelled larvae. From the mixed preferences recorded on the choice bioassays, factors other than hydrophobicity play a significant role in the selection of a surface on. All coatings were superhydrophobic (&gt; 155&#186;) but differed in roughness and produced very different settlement responses. The consistently high level of deterrence by the nano-scale surface supports a theory of nano-bubbles at the surface of these coatings as an antifouling mechanism. The confirmation of this theory requires further collaborative investigation between physicists, chemists and biologists, but is a significant outcome.
 
 Overall, the research presented has elucidated a number of novel approaches to biomimetic fouling control and developed novel theories for the mechanisms of action of natural surface-mediated fouling defences. These results also contribute to the development of promising alternatives to toxic antifouling technologies and provide unique approaches to significant new developments in micro- and nano-surface technologies in the field.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2091/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2091/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tangled visions: changing scientific understandings of the North Queensland rainforests, 1770 &#8211; 1990</field><field name="creator">Sanderson, Rachel L.</field><field name="description">Science and scientists have played key roles in shaping popular perceptions of
 the rainforest environment, and their work has directed both the development and
 preservation of rainforest areas in North Queensland. This thesis examines the broad
 development of scientific understandings of, and interactions with, the rainforests of
 North Queensland from the period of early European exploration to the emergence of
 powerful scientific support for rainforest conservation in the 1980s. The thesis focuses
 on four distinct but interrelated scientific approaches: taxonomic botany, ecology,
 palaeoecology and biogeography. In particular, it argues that two shifts in scientific
 understanding have been of critical importance in re-shaping perceptions of rainforest.
 The first was the emergence of an ecological view of the rainforests, which saw them
 not as conglomerations of species, but as complex living systems. The second was the
 revision of the evolutionary history of Australian rainforests, from the belief that they
 were an &#8216;alien and invasive&#8217; form of vegetation, to the understanding that these forests
 were of ancient and indigenous origin. Further, this thesis argues that scientists&#8217;
 attempts to understand the rainforest have led them to consider the complex and
 interconnected environmental and human histories of the region. The thesis explores
 the way scientific texts can act as historical documents, both because of the evidence
 they provide about land-use and environmental change, and because of the ways in
 which they reflect in content and form the changing environmental values and visions
 of a settler society.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2092/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2092/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of two and three-dimensional method of fragments to analyse drainage behaviour in hydraulic fill stopes</field><field name="creator">Rankine, Kelda S.</field><field name="description">The extraction and processing of most mineral ores, result in the generation of large
 volumes of finer residue or tailings. The safe disposal of such material is of prime
 environmental, safety and economical concern to the management of mining
 operations. In underground metaliferous mining operations, where backfilling of
 mining voids is necessary, one option is to fill these voids with a tailings-based
 engineered product. In cases where the fill is placed as a slurry and the fill contains
 free water, permeable barricades are generally constructed to contain the fill within the
 mining void whilst providing a suitable means for the drainage water to escape from
 the fill. Recent barricade failures, resulting from poor drainage, have led to an
 immediate need for an increased understanding of the pore pressure developments and
 flow rates throughout the filling operation. This thesis presents simple analytical
 solutions, based on the &#8216;method of fragments,&#8217; for estimating discharge and maximum
 pore pressure for two and three-dimensional hydraulically filled stopes. Shape factors
 were developed to account for the inherent individuality associated with stope and
 drain geometry. The influence of scaling on discharge and pore pressure
 measurements is also investigated. The proposed solutions are verified against
 solutions derived from a finite difference program and physical modelling of a scaled
 mine stope and results showed excellent agreement. Using these analytical solutions
 developed for flow through three-dimensional hydraulic fill stopes, a user-friendly
 EXCEL model was developed to accurately and efficiently model the drainage
 behaviour in three-dimensional stopes. The model simulates the complete filling and
 draining of the stopes and was verified using the finite difference software FLAC3D.
 The variation and sensitivity in drainage behaviour and pore water pressure

Where strategic planning has been applied it has been largely based on for-profit models which are founded on providing benefits to customer and shareholder stakeholders and in developing sustainable competitive advantage. But third sector organisations are more interested in maximising benefits to members where the benefits are not of a financial nature. So it is timely to consider an approach more appropriate to the aims of third sector organisations. The third sector consists of private organisations formed and sustained by members acting voluntarily without personal profit, are democratically controlled, provide benefits to others, and material benefits to members are proportionate to their contribution to the organisation. There are over 600 000 third sector organisations in Australia, employing in excess of 410 000 equivalent full-time employees (Philanthropy and the Third Sector in Asia and the Pacific, 2005). 
 Research to investigate strategy in third sector organisations can be set up in two main ways. One, seek the opinions of office holders in such organisations. But clearly they have few answers to those problems. Or two, look in-depth at one professional association to ascertain the priorities of the membership. The latter seems more likely to give promising results. The organisation chosen for this research was the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport in Australia (CILTA). The research was carried out employing focus groups, in-depth interviews, and document searches that enabled eight Australian case studies to be developed, which were then compared and contrasted with a very successful case in Singapore (CILTS). 
 The aim of the research is to understand the nature of strategy formulation and implementation in voluntary professional membership associations (VMPAs), which led to inductive research. The case studies were generated and guided principally by the ideas of Yin (2003), to conduct &#8216;with-in&#8217; and &#8216;between case&#8217; analysis. Important themes emerging from the within-case analysis are summarised in Table 1:

 &#8226; A &#8216;business model&#8217; is necessary to expand organisational capability
 &#8226; Strategy needs to be concentrated and focused
 &#8226; Key strategy barriers are:
 - poor communication between Sections and between National Office and Sections
 - poor implementation of developed strategy
 - voluntary membership
 - ineffective management committees resulting from resource constraints and high turn-over of committee members due to election cycle
 - lack of commitment and/or interest by committee members
 - a view held by younger and newer members that older and retired members (&#8216;old farts club&#8217;) are acting as gatekeepers and are resistant to change
 - no manageable approach to strategy development
 - attempting to manage multiple strategies
 &#8226; Appropriate terminology is necessary to reflect the voluntary nature of the organisation so that members can understand and identify with
 &#8226; Organisational values are meaningful to support strategy, but do not drive strategy formulation.
 &#8226; Relationship building is an essential strategy outcome
 &#8226; Concentration of strategy effort is necessary to focus effort to a limited number of strategic areas.
 &#8226; The systemic problem that even though almost all participants believed that the Institute is not competing with other associations, membership is optional, (a discretionary purchase), in contrast to other PAs where membership is required.
 
 Twenty-five elements related to strategy context, strategy barriers, and issues influencing strategy development and implementation emerged from the between-case analysis conducted in Chapter 5. These elements are summarised in Table 2.

 Two strategy models developed from this research are presented in Chapter 5. The first is the Strategy Drivers model which identifies the conceptual issues driving strategy consideration in the case organisations. The effect of the Strategy Drivers model is to develop a simple framework of prioritised issues and associated questions requiring continual review as part of an ongoing strategy process. The framework recognises that the fundamental for-profit question &#8216;what business are we in&#8217; is inappropriate for the CILTA, operating within an existing legal and taxation system, which constrains operations to the Institute&#8217;s constitution. For-profit organisations are able to significantly change the nature of their business to reflect their competitive environment, if they so choose. The CILTA and VMPAs are not permitted to change the nature of their &#8216;business&#8217; without fundamentally altering their standing as a &#8216;non profit&#8217; organisation. 
 The Strategy Drivers model recognises the necessity for a simple approach to strategy that differentiates the organisation from other industry institutes. By positioning the Institute in the industry to determine the role to be played (finding 20), relationships can be developed and maintained with other organisations (finding 4), rather than adopting a competitive stance (finding 3). The outcome is an integrated strategy that focuses limited resources (finding 12), to avoid &#8216;multiple&#8217; ineffective strategies (finding 15). 
 The model recognises the voluntary nature of the CILTA, and other VMPAs, by providing a framework for ongoing strategic thinking and discussion by committee members, with limited experience and knowledge of the strategy process (finding 13). 
 The second strategy model is the Future Shaping model which describes a holistic strategy process, the level below the issues driving strategy formulation. The Future Shaping model identifies specific questions to be addressed in the strategy process and provides a framework to facilitate implementation of chosen strategy. The model synthesises the findings of the between-case analysis to develop a simple, flexible approach (Context finding 6) to strategy development in the CILTA. The importance of an integrated strategy outcome from the strategy process is central to this model, as identified in the research (Barriers finding 7 and Issues finding 25). 
 The Future Shaping model contributes a new dimension to third sector strategy development. Strategy development, based on this model, is focused towards relationship building, in an environment based on co-operation, and free from competitive posturing (finding 3). The model demonstrates that members are a key input, and beneficiary, of the strategy process. The strength of the value outcomes of the strategy process is a significant contributor to membership decline or growth. The model demonstrates that the strategy process is primarily influenced by those issues identified to be in the Institutes sphere of influence, as determined by the identity, reputation, and role(s) adopted. Strategy development commences with the organisation answering the fundamental issues driving the process, &#8216;why do we exist?&#8217;, &#8216;to whom will we provide value?&#8217;, and &#8216;what value will we provide?&#8217; The research demonstrates that strategy formulation in the CILTA is restricted by the lack of a simple, clear and flexible model of strategy development (findings 2, 6, 12, and 13). The Future Shaping model addresses that deficiency. 
 Based on the research conducted for this thesis, the following implementation recommendations are offered. 
 Recommendation One 
 Institutes and associations conduct member forums, first at the Section level, to determine member needs by addressing the issues of (1) Existence (why do we exist?), and (2) Value (what value do we provide; to whom do we provide value?). Second, national executive committees develop directional statements resulting from the member forums. 
 Recommendation Two 
 The issues of Relevance and Credibility, Position, Leadership, and Concentration, are considered by national executives following the determination of recommendation one outcomes. 
 Recommendation Three 
 National executives of cooperating institutes and associations address the strategy issues of Position, Leadership, and Concentration in a cooperative strategy formulation process, to determine association and institute synergy across the relevant industry grouping. 
 Recommendation Four 
 National executive&#8217;s feedback to Sections the Position and Role(s) adopted as an outcome of the industry relationship loop, as determined in recommendation three. 
 Recommendation Five 
 National executives develop an integrated strategy to implement the outcomes of recommendations one to four. 
 Recommendation Six 
 Sections adopt the Strategic Drivers framework, to consider the strategic issues at the local level, and within the context of the national strategy outcomes. 
 Recommendation Seven 
 At least twenty percent of each national and section executive meeting be devoted to strategic dialogue of the strategy issues identified in the Strategy Drivers framework. 
 Recommendation Eight 
 An Industry Advisory Body (IAB) be established at national and section levels to provide strategic advice to management committees. 
 The contribution that this research makes to the third sector literature is that the thrust of any strategy model should be on the benefits to members, as opposed to a model that uses competitive strategy to provide benefits to stakeholders, as is the case in for-profit organisations. The practical value of the models is that professional associations will be able to reorient their focus to manage on behalf of their members, and have a method of ascertaining what is important to fulfil members&#8217; needs, and to enhance and grow the association. 
 There is a growing literature on third sector organisations. However, many of the problems faced by such organisations, particularly VMPAs, have not been identified. The major benefits of the research are that the strategy models, if followed, will lead to an ability to deliver what is required by the membership, and in doing so, grow the organisation and increase its influence in the industry sector.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2094/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2094/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tissue thickness as a tool to monitor the stress response of massive porites corals to turbidity impact on Lihir Island, Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Rotmann, Sandra</field><field name="description">In massive Porites colonies, living tissue invests only a thin layer on the
 outer perimeter of the skeleton, normally around 25-50% of an annual
 growth increment in healthy colonies. The depth to which skeleton is
 occupied by tissue is referred to as &#8216;tissue thickness&#8217;. Tissue thickness has
 been argued to be a sensitive bioindicator that may be potentially used to
 monitor changes in coral health prior to collapse and mortality. The primary
 goal of this study was to assess the response of tissue thickness in massive
 Porites colonies at Lihir Island (3005&#8217;S 152038&#8217;E) to an anthropogenically
 increased turbidity regime associated with mining activities. In order to
 achieve this goal it was also necessary to identify possible sources of
 natural variability in tissue thickness, both spatial and temporal, and to
 quantify their influence. Possible sources of tissue thickness variability
 identified through both literature review and observation included: i)
 changes in thickness through the lunar month as a function of skeletal
 growth patterns; ii) change in thickness due to differences in local
 environmental conditions; iii) change in tissue thickness with differences in
 colony size and shape. Where possible, the influence of all of these factors
 was examined in both shallow (&lt;11 m) and deep (&gt;14 m) habitats, across
 sites around Lihir Island and between years (sampling took place in 2001,
 2002, and 2003).
 
 Tissue thickness in massive Porites changes over a lunar month as part of
 skeletal growth processes. This study looked for ways in which allowance
 could be made and procedures devised for sampling at different times of the lunar month. Tissue thickness decreased, on average, by 20% on the
 day after the full moon. Tissue thickness increased, on average, by 0.3 &#61676;m
 per day during the lunar month. These patterns of variation were
 consistently observed between study sites, at different depths, and in
 different sampling years. The only exception appeared to be when tissue
 thickness became critically thin (below 2.2 mm), which was only found at a
 site heavily affected by turbidity. Hence, growth processes in massive
 Porites were reduced or halted when limited energy reserves were available
 under stressful conditions. Monthly tissue uplift in the same colonies was
 resumed when an increase in tissue thickness above the minimum
 threshold of 2.2 mm was achieved. The consistency of tissue variations
 throughout the lunar month in all but these very few extremely stressed
 individuals allowed measurements taken from individuals at different times
 of the lunar month to be easily adjusted for comparison.
 
 In the second study, changes in tissue thickness in response to increased
 turbidity were examined by measuring tissue thickness in massive Porites
 colonies along an anthropogenic turbidity gradient in 2001, 2002 and 2003.
 Tissue thickness was significantly less where turbidity levels reached 15-
 30mg l-1. This was the maximum turbidity encountered near coral reefs in
 this study. Tissue thickness was not significantly reduced by lower turbidity
 levels, but it was always less in colonies in deeper water than in colonies in
 shallow water. Some variability of tissue thickness was also observed
 between study sites and years. However, neither spatial nor temporal
 variability masked the general pattern of decreasing tissue thickness with
 increasing turbidity.
 
 The final study examined differences in tissue thickness with colony size
 and shape and looked at environmentally-induced changes in tissue
 thickness in colonies with different morphologies. Massive Porites corals on
 Lihir Island were found to occur in six distinct growth forms, namely
 rounded, round-encrusting, pyramidical, pyramid-encrusting, encrusting
 and vertical encrusting. Some of these shapes could be described
 quantitatively by height/circumference ratios. However, the angle of
 substrata slope was found to be a better indicator for changes in shapes
 with study sites and water depth. Allowing for changes in tissue thickness
 with depth, colony morphology did not affect tissue thickness. Hence,
 colony morphology was not a significant factor in sampling for tissue
 thickness. Similar-sized colonies were selected for sampling. The effects of
 colony size on tissue thickness were tested and colony size could also be
 excluded as a factor which significantly affected tissue thickness.
 
 Patterns of change in tissue thickness in Porites colonies at Lihir Island
 indicated that mining activities had affected, and were affecting, corals and
 coral communities over a much more restricted area than predicted by the
 mine&#8217;s environmental impact statement. Tissue thickness patterns
 corresponded closely with indices of live coral cover and turbidity
 measurements. Tissue thickness was found to be a simple and reliable
 bioindicator for turbidity stress on corals on Lihir Island. Changes in tissue
 thickness indicate when corals are being adversely affected by
 anthropogenic activities. This gives tissue thickness a huge advantage over
 other monitoring techniques, because these mostly detect change after it
 has occurred - and not while it is occurring.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2095/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2095/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Abundance, demography and population structure of the grey reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) and the white tip reef shark (Triaenodon obesus) (Fam. Charcharhinidae)
 
</field><field name="creator">Robbins, William D.</field><field name="description">Reef sharks (fam. Carcharhinidae) are high-order predators, found throughout the Indo-
 Pacific. I examined the abundance, growth, reproduction and demography of two
 species of reef carcharhinid; the grey reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) and the
 whitetip reef shark (Triaenodon obesus), and investigated the genetic stock structure of
 T. obesus across the Indo-Pacific.
 
 Underwater visual census protocols were successfully developed, and provided realtime,
 fisheries-independent estimates of reef carcharhinid abundances. Visual censusing
 of a minimally-exploited reef system ascertained that reef crest was the preferred habitat
 of T. obesus and C. amblyrhynchos, while the blacktip reef shark (C. melanopterus) was
 more abundant in reef flat and lagoon habitats. Reef carcharhinid densities were low,
 and even in the most abundant habitat, did not exceed 3.5 sharks hectare-1. Visual
 censuses across reef systems in the Indian and Pacific Oceans found consistently low
 numbers of reef sharks, with most regions having less than 0.5 sharks hectare-1. Closer
 investigation of the Great Barrier Reef (Australia) revealed a significant effect of
 fishing management on reef shark abundance. All levels of fishing pressure impacted
 upon reef carcharhinid abundance, with reductions on fished reefs of up to 80% and
 97% for T. obesus and C. amblyrhynchos, respectively. This suggests that reef shark
 populations are particularly vulnerable to population depletion. The inability of marine
 protected areas to provide refuge for reef carcharhinids was highlighted and discussed.
 
 Age and growth characteristics of T. obesus and C. amblyrhynchos populations from the
 Great Barrier Reef were examined through vertebral thin sections. Both shark species grew slowly, with longevities of 19 years. Females out-lived males in both species.
 Both sexes of C. amblyrhynchos grew at similar rates, while sexually-dimorphic growth
 rates were observed in older T. obesus. Age estimates were preliminarily validated
 through oxytetracyclined recaptures of C. amblyrhynchos, while characterisation of the
 vertebral edge provided strong evidence that T. obesus also lays annual growth bands.
 
 Females matured 1-2 years later than males, at 8 and 11 years for T. obesus and C.
 amblyrhynchos, respectively. Mean litter sizes were comparable with smaller (&lt;1 m)
 carcharhinids. Litter sizes initially increased with female body size in C.
 amblyrhynchos, reaching 3-4 pups per breeding for most of their reproductive life.
 Litter sizes ranged between 1-4 pups per breeding in T. obesus, with a mean of 2 pups
 per breeding, irrespective of female somatic size. Breeding occurs biennially in both
 species, with an offspring sex ratio of 1:1. For the longevities recorded, maximum
 reproductive output was estimated at 12 pups per female for both species.
 
 Population dynamics of the two species were analysed using age-based (Leslie)
 matrices. Using two methods of mortality estimation, annual decline rates of 6.3-8.8%
 year-1 and 10.3-15.2% year-1 were found for T. obesus and C. amblyrhynchos,
 respectively. This suggests that reef carcharhinids are overfished on the Great Barrier
 Reef. Based on current (albeit exploited) demographic parameters, the natural rates of
 population growth were estimated at 3.4-5.7% year-1 for T. obesus, and 0.8&#8211;3.5% year-1
 for C. amblyrhynchos. Elasticity analyses and reproductive values showed that juvenile
 survival is the most important component of each species lifespan. However, catch
 analyses revealed that a high proportion of juveniles are taken in both species
 (especially C. amblyrhynchos). At the current rates of decline, abundances of T. obesus 
 and C. amblyrhynchos are forecast to decline to 16-27% and 4-12% of current levels on
 fished reefs in the next 20 years, respectively.
 
 Development of an in-situ underwater biopsy probe enabled non-lethal, minimally
 invasive, collection of reef carcharhinid tissues. High levels of genetic differentiation
 were found in T. obesus across the Indo-Pacific, as well as between two contiguous sites
 on the Great Barrier Reef. Genetic separation did not correlate with geographic
 separation, suggesting that T. obesus has a high degree of site fidelity on coral reefs,
 even when migrations are possible. On an evolutionary scale, it was found that the
 Indian Ocean was invaded first by T. obesus, with Pacific Ocean invasion occurring
 simultaneously with a second Indian Ocean invasion.
 
 The unique combination of fisheries-independent abundance counts, population
 dynamics and investigation of genetic stock structure provides a comprehensive
 overview of the low abundance and slow population dynamics of coral reef
 carcharhinids. Findings from this PhD provide further evidence of the variety of age and
 reproductive strategies employed by the family Carcharhinidae, and a scientific basis
 for future decisions regarding reef carcharhinid management.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2096/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2096/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The spatial ecology of dugongs: applications to conservation management</field><field name="creator">Sheppard, James K.</field><field name="description">Dugongs are large primary consumers of seagrass communities, and thereby shape the diversity, structure,
 and dynamics of these extensive ecosystems. The dugong is listed as vulnerable to extinction at a global
 scale. Because dugongs are seagrass specialists, understanding the interaction between dugongs and their
 seagrass habitats is crucial to their conservation. Habitat use by dugongs is beginning to receive greater
 attention by managers and ecologists, but a spatially-explicit model capable of predicting usage by
 dugongs based on attributes of those habitats is lacking. Studying the interaction between dugongs and
 their seagrass food requires knowledge of the movements and diving behaviour of dugongs at scales
 relevant to both dugongs and managers. Information is needed on dugong spatial patterns, including
 movement behaviours and habitat use, across domains of scale. Multi-scale approaches to dugong
 research have not been possible in the past because of the difficulties in observing dugongs directly and
 the low resolution of telemetric equipment.
 
 My project capitalised on recent technology incorporating accurate GPS technology into tracking
 equipment to monitor the habitat use of wild animals at very high resolution (&lt;10 m). Advances in
 geographic information systems (GIS) and spatial modelling enabled habitat selection by satellite-tracked
 dugongs to be analysed in a high-resolution, spatially explicit manner. I used hierarchical scales of spatial
 analyses to assess the relative importance of different seagrass meadows and parts of meadows to
 dugongs at scales that are suitable for informing policy concerning the management of human activities.
 My central research hypotheses were that: (1) dugongs forage like terrestrial mammalian grazers in that
 they prefer habitats where their foraging efficiency is greatest and (2) patterns of dugong movements and
 habitat use across spatial scales are intimately linked to the availability and distribution of quality
 seagrass forage.
 
 I investigated the mechanisms that produce the large-scale distribution and movement patterns of dugongs
 by reanalysing the results of historical aerial surveys and satellite tracking conducted by earlier
 researchers in combination with new data from my GPS telemetry of 20 dugongs in sub-tropical and
 tropical waters of Queensland and the Northern Territory, Australia. The mean patch size supporting high
 relative density (&gt; 0.1 dugongs/km2) of dugongs over 20 years along the urban coast of Queensland was
 77 km2 (&#177; 4 s.e.). Hence, at regional and landscape scales (&gt; 100 km2) dugongs select habitat at the level
 of individual bays along the coast. The tracked dugongs were followed for periods ranging from 15 to 551
 days and exhibited a large range of individualistic movement behaviours; 26 individuals were relatively
 sedentary (moving &lt; 15 km) while 44 made large-scale movements (&gt; 15 km) of up to 560 km from their
 capture sites. Male and female animals, including cows with calves, undertook large-scale movements
 (LSM; &gt; 15 km).
 
 At least some of these movements were return movements to the capture location, suggesting that such
 movements were ranging rather than dispersal movements. Large-scale movements included macro-scale
 regional movements (&gt; 100 km) and meso-scale inter-patch local movements (15 &#8804; 100 km) and were
 qualitatively different from tidally-driven micro-scale commuting movements between and within
 seagrass beds (&lt; 15 km). Large-scale movements were rapid and apparently directed. Tracked dugongs
 rarely travelled far from the coast (mean max distance = 12.8 &#177; s.e. 1.3 km). Dive profiles from the timedepth
 recorders suggest that dugongs make repeated deep dives while travelling rather than remaining at
 the surface. Some animals caught in the high latitude limits of the dugongs&#8217; range on the Australian east
 coast in winter apparently undertook long distance movements in response to low water temperatures,
 similar to the seasonal movements of Florida manatees.
 
 A 24 km2 seagrass meadow in Hervey Bay, Queensland, Australia was confirmed as important dugong
 habitat on the basis of the tracking data. Marine videography, Near-infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) and
 Geographic Information Systems (GIS) were used to survey, analyse and map seagrass species
 composition, nutrient profile and patch structure of the meadow at high resolution (200 m). Five species
 of seagrass covered 91 % of the total habitat area. The total above and below-ground seagrass biomass
 was estimated to be 222.7 &#177; s.e. 19.6 t dry-weight. Halodule uninervis dominated the pasture (81.8 %,
 162.2 t), followed by Halophila ovalis (35.3 %, 16.5 t), Zostera capricorni (15.9 %, 22.2 t), Halophila
 spinulosa (14.5 %, 21.9 t), and traces of Halodule pinifolia. Because the distributions of the various
 seagrass species overlapped, their combined percentage totalled &gt; 100 % of the survey area. The seagrass
 formed a continuous meadow of varying density.
 
 For all seagrass species, the above-ground component (shoots and leaves) possessed greater total nitrogen
 than the below-ground component (roots and rhizomes), which possessed greater total starch. Because of
 the relatively low intraspecific variation in nutrient composition, nutrients were concentrated according to
 seagrass biomass density. H. uninervis was the most nutritious seagrass species because of its higher
 whole-plant nitrogen (1.28 &#177; s.e. 0.05 % DW) and starch (6.42 &#177; s.e. 0.50 DW %) content. H. uninervis
 formed large, clustered patches of dense biomass across the pasture and thus nitrogen and starch were
 concentrated where H. uninervis was prevalent. These survey and analytical techniques enabled me to
 rapidly, economically and accurately quantify and characterise seagrass habitat at scales relevant to a
 large forager.
 
 I used GIS and spatial statistics to identify the role of physical environmental characteristics in
 determining the activity patterns and fine-scale space-use of dugongs tracked in coastal and deepwater
 seagrass habitats using GPS telemetry. A seagrass meadow was defined as a core dugong habitat if more
 than 10 days of satellite location fixes were obtained from an individual animal occupying an area &lt;100
 km2. Habitats were categorised as inshore/intertidal or offshore/subtidal depending on their distance to the
 shore and the water depth. Inshore/intertidal habitats had a shallow component that was exposed at low tide. Offshore/subtidal habitats were at least 5 km from the nearest mainland and were at least 3 m deep at
 mean low water spring tide (MLWS). Location fixes acquired from dugongs tracked in coastal habitats
 exhibited significant circadian rhythms, with fewer locations during the morning than during late
 afternoon/night. GPS location fixes could only be acquired when the transmitter was at the surface. Such
 periods are typically brief, as when the animal surfaces to breathe. More GPS locations were acquired
 from inshore/intertidal dugongs that were foraging in the intertidal zone than from animals in the subtidal
 zone. This telemetric artefact provided an indication of when the animals were moving across shallow
 intertidal waters. More locations were received at night when the animals were generally closest to the
 shore and in shallow water and fewer locations were received during the day when animals were further
 subtidal in deeper waters. Hence, the average depth of water experienced by dugongs and their distances
 from the shore may have been significantly underestimated, especially when fix success was low, since
 animals that were in shallower water were more likely to be sampled. Consequently, my estimates of the
 diel patterns of dugong space use were more conservative than the actual situation and probably
 underestimated the strength of the tidal patterns.
 
 Dugongs were in deeper water more often during the morning than during late afternoon/night. There was
 no effect of tide height on the actual depths in which dugongs occurred. Dugongs in coastal habitats were
 furthest from the shore between 6:00am and 12:00pm and closest between 3:00pm and 12:00am.
 Dugongs were closer to the shore during high tide than during low tide. Physical environment variables
 had little or no effect on the spatial patterns of dugongs tracked in deep water. The movement speeds of
 the coastal and deepwater dugongs increased marginally between 9:00am and 3:00pm, from an average of
 200 to 300 m/hr.
 
 Seven dugongs were GPS tracked at a fine spatial scale (&lt; 10m) within the Burrum seagrass habitat in
 winter. Resource selection within the habitat was modelled by comparing the dugongs&#8217; use of space with
 the distribution of their seagrass food resources within an area defined using the combined space-use of
 the tracked animals. The association of dugongs with seagrass quantity (biomass) and quality (nutrients)
 was analysed within six time/tide combinations to examine the influences of tidal periodicity and the diel
 cycle on resource selection. I used resource utilisation functions (RUFs) to relate a probabilistic measure
 of each individual dugong&#8217;s space-use in each time/tide combination in a utilisation distribution (UD)
 (dependent variable) to the spatial landscapes of the resource variables (independent variables) using
 multiple regression.
 
 The RUF models indicated that dugong space-use was consistently centred over seagrass patches with
 high nitrogen concentrations, except during the day at low tides when their space-use was centred over
 high seagrass biomass and away from seagrass with high starch concentration. Dugong association with
 seagrass high in starch was positive during both day and night high tides when dugongs could access
 intertidal areas where the seagrass biomass was generally low. Patterns of association with seagrass species were less definite. Estimates of the intensity of dugong space-use in relation to available seagrass
 resources may be confounded by the differentiation of fix probability by depth and speed. Because my
 estimates of dugong space-use in relation to subtidal seagrass may have been more conservative than the
 data suggested, the positive association of dugongs with patches of high biomass seagrass and avoidance
 of patches containing H. spinulosa and Z. capricorni in the subtidal zone may have been over-estimated
 by this sampling bias.
 
 I posit that dugong habitat selection and resource use occur hierarchically, across (at least) three different
 domains of scale: (1)at a regional-scale (&gt; 10 000 km2) dugongs select habitat at the level of individual
 bays along the Queensland coast; (2) at a landscape-scale (&lt; 10 000 km2), dugongs select seagrass
 pastures within bays along the Queensland coast comprised of nutritious plant species; (3) at a local-scale
 (&lt; 10 km2) within seagrass pastures that are within bays along the Queensland coast, dugongs select
 seagrass patches on the basis of their nutrient concentrations. I recommend that the appropriate scales at
 which to manage dugong populations and their seagrass habitats be co-ordinated within and across the
 hierarchical scales of habitat use indicated by my analysis.
 
 My finding that dugongs frequently undertake large-scale moves has implications for management at a
 range of scales, and strengthens the aerial survey and genetic evidence for management and monitoring at
 ecological scales that cross jurisdictions. The capacity of large-scale monitoring programs to detect trends
 in dugong numbers at scales of even thousands of km2 is confounded by the dugongs' tendency to
 undertake large-scale moves. With movement between bays a common occurrence, estimates of
 population size and trends can only be meaningfully made at regional scales.
 
 The tendency for dugongs to track the bottom on large-scale movements may increase their vulnerability
 to incidental capture in bottom set gill nets. In addition, if dugongs transfer their spatial knowledge of the
 location of quality food resource patches to their offspring, then local depletions will lead to loss of this
 knowledge. Areas of high quality seagrass may thus become unknown to dugongs. In the absence of
 grazing pressure such areas may become less valuable as dugong habitat if the early seral stage species of
 seagrass preferred by dugongs convert to more fibrous species.
 
 My research suggests that dugongs actively select seagrass habitats comprised primarily of H. ovalis and
 H. uninervis, based on the high starch and nitrogen content of these species. Bays containing these quality
 food resources comprise an interlinked network of core habitats between which dugongs frequently move.
 Accordingly, bays along the Queensland coast with seagrass meadows dominated by H. ovalis and H.
 uninervis should be afforded a high level of protection as potential quality dugong habitat. Bays with
 extensive intertidal meadows of H. uninervis should also receive enhanced protection, even if the seagrass
 biomass is low. Even though they have low seagrass biomass, thermoregulatory habitats play an important role in maintaining dugong populations and should be included in dugong habitat protection
 strategies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2097/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2097/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of interpretation in sustainable tourism: a qualitative approach to understanding passenger experiences on expedition cruises
 
</field><field name="creator">Walker, Kaye B.</field><field name="description">The challenge of any research in sustainable tourism is not only how to measure or assess the achievement of sustainability, but also how to implement such. A current trend in both practice and research is to consider the conduct of ecotourism as a means to achieve the concepts of sustainable tourism and the principles of sustainability. This thesis proposes that one of the avenues that ecotourism may contribute to the principles of sustainability is through the interpretation delivered as an integral component of this type of tourism. An inductive qualitative methodological approach is presented and a model of effective interpretation has been developed. This model is called The Value Model of Effective Interpretation 1. The model identifies interpretive activity features, outcomes and the pathways that will most likely lead to value based responses. A new theoretical interpretive approach has been developed in conjunction with the model and is referred to as the &#8220;Personal Insight Interpretive Approach&#8221;. The premise of the model and the approach is that specific interpretive features and outcomes are facilitated via a ladder of abstraction and means-end analysis techniques. These techniques facilitate and identify the participants&#8217; cognitive placement of thematic messages and experience with personally significant values which link to environmentally or culturally responsible &#8220;Intentional Behaviours&#8221;. The model has been placed into a Research and Applied Framework in order to incorporate community orientated values and goals into the sustainable tourism process. This is achieved via a multidimensional ecotourism operation with a multicentric interpretive approach, known as Expedition Cruising. The thesis was guided by the hypothesis that it is only when newly acquired or enhanced knowledge and experience takes on personal psychological significance in the form of values or beliefs that interpretation can be considered to be effective. (Walker, 2006) 
 
 Chapter 1 presents the overall Research Aims and the findings of a literature review that established the relationships between the research components of sustainability, sustainable tourism, ecotourism, interpretation and community and identified the contexts in which interpretation could contribute to achieving the principles of sustainable tourism. In doing so, a number of gaps in the research became evident which included the identification of comparative evaluative components of effective interpretation, methods of assessment and evaluation with respect to achieving the principles of sustainability, and a framework incorporating and connecting the tourist and the community through interpretation.
 
 Chapter 2 draws together the key findings of the literature review with the development of a framework to guide the proposed research and justifies the methodological approach used to conduct the research. This is an inductive qualitative approach utilising the Means-end Analysis technique for Expedition Cruise passenger responses to their interpretive experience. Three case studies were conducted, consisting initially of multiple expedition cruises and then progressively more specific locations during certain cruises. The data collection methods include open-ended written questionnaires, in-depth interviews and participant observation. The broad research aims presented in Chapter 1 are translated into three Parts with associated Key Research Questions, and the use of Expedition Cruising as the platform for this investigation is described.
 
 Chapter 3 presents Study 1 which investigates the Environmental Values and Interpretation components of the Research Framework, and addresses the Key Research Questions of Part 1, Environmental Sustainability. It is based upon research conducted during four Expedition Cruises in Alaska and the data is compared to the interpretive objectives of the environmental management agency for that region. The findings resulted in the development of The Value Model of Interpretation which was the initial model used for comparison and re-evaluation of findings throughout the research. This model depicted the interpretive attributes and benefits which passengers perceived to be most important, with the most significant representation of &#8220;Environmental awareness&#8221;.
 
 Chapter 4 presents Study 2 which initialises investigation of the Community Values component of the Research Framework and is based upon a cultural Expedition Cruise experience on Stanley Is, Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Traditional Owner guides conducted the interpretation and the community&#8217;s interpretive aims were compared to the passengers&#8217; value based responses. There were correlations as well as interesting findings regarding a &#8220;sense of place&#8221; interpretive approach linking to the facilitation of a &#8220;care of place&#8221; represented by the participants&#8217; major identification of the personal value of &#8220;Cultural/environmental concern&#8221;.
 
 Chapter 5 presents Study 3 which finalises the investigation of the Community Values and Model development components of the Research Framework, and addresses the Key Research Questions for Parts 2 and 3, Community Sustainability and The Value Model of Interpretation. This study was conducted during and after an Expedition Cruise visit to Easter Island, Chile. The findings identified a substantial representation of the beneficial outcome of &#8220;Cultural tourism awareness&#8221; and the greatest representation in the research of the value &#8220;Self appreciation&#8221; which refers to the identification of personal insights. An overall analysis of the data suggested the development of personal insights created linkages to post-experience intentional behaviours. The Value Model of Effective Interpretation 1 was developed as well as an interpretive theory called the &#8220;Personal Insight Approach&#8221; which allies strongly with the &#8220;Mindfulness&#8221; approach.
 
 Chapter 6 concludes the thesis by addressing the original Research Aims, suggesting future research and commenting on its contribution to theory and application in the fields of study. Major contributions included the development of: a new model of effective interpretation; an operation framework for incorporating this model and community orientated values into the sustainable tourism process; an evaluative and investigative research methodology; effective interpretation and sustainability indicators; a new theory in interpretive research.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2098/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2098/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The function of spontaneous and BDNF-induced repair of the rat olivocerebellar system</field><field name="creator">Willson, Melina L.</field><field name="description">Research on improving recovery of neural function after adult brain injury has focused on
 axonal regeneration, i.e. the concept of recapitulating developmental axonal growth in the
 central nervous system (CNS). Although studies that increase axonal regeneration give
 rise to some functional improvement, it rarely ameliorates complex neural actions. Some
 attention has been directed to the type of reinnervation that takes place in the neonatal
 CNS, in which neurons surviving after injury spontaneously develop new axons to
 replace the damaged path and re-form its specific pattern with correct afferent-target
 connections. Such reinnervation is partly recreated in the maturing CNS by injection of
 growth factors e.g. brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The aim of this project was
 to examine in vivo the structure and function of spontaneous and BDNF-associated
 alternate reinnervation.
 
 We used the rat olivocerebellar projection to characterise the anatomy, physiology and
 complex (cognitive) neural function of spontaneous and BDNF-associated post-lesion
 olivocerebellar reinnervation. In the adult, the olivocerebellar path has a well-defined
 topography where axons enter the cerebellum via the contralateral inferior cerebellar
 peduncle and terminate as climbing fibres (CFs) onto Purkinje cells (PCs) to regulate
 motor and spatial functions. Our model involves unilateral axonal transection of this path
 (pedunculotomy; Px), either at postnatal day (P) 3 to induce spontaneous reinnervation, or
 P11 when reinnervation only occurs after injection of BDNF.
 
 First, we examined whether spontaneous olivocerebellar reinnervation compensated
 complex functions such as spatial learning. As reinnervation is partial in the region which
 mediates spatial cognition, its capacity to mediate navigation was unknown. We tested
 rats with (Px3) and without (Px11) reinnervation in simple locomotion and spatial (water
 maze) tasks. Px3 animals performed the spatial task as well as controls despite learning
 more erratically while Px11 animals did not learn the task. The amount of reinnervation
 directly correlated with spatial ability, suggesting that even partial reinnervation was
 associated with functional benefit in a complex task.
 
 Next, we assessed the effect of increasing olivocerebellar reinnervation by BDNF on its
 associated functions. BDNF/vehicle-treated animals were tested on simple/complex
 motor and spatial tasks and the amount and distribution of reinnervation were analysed.
 BDNF did not affect basic motor skills, however on the rotarod BDNF-treated Px11
 animals were similar to normal and Px3 groups. They also exhibited better spatial abilities
 than vehicle-treated Px11 animals. BDNF treatment increased the amount and distribution
 of reinnervation in both Px3 and Px11 animals. This suggests that neurotrophin-induced
 reinnervation facilitated appropriate complex (i.e. cognitive) actions.
 
 Finally, as reinnervating synapses do not always induce appropriate target responses, we
 examined the synaptic function of BDNF-associated olivocerebellar reinnervation to
 assess any correlation between CF reinnervation and improved behaviour. CF currents
 (amplitude, paired-pulse depression [PPD], fatigue) were recorded from adult PCs and the
 structural CF-PC interactions measured. In synapses forming ~6days post Px3, BDNF
 was associated with impaired CF-PC interaction (smaller synaptic amplitude, greater PPD
 smaller CFs). Whereas BDNF-induced reinnervation (i.e.Px11) had increased PPD
 without affecting anatomical attributes. As PPD aids CF-PC transmission at low in vivo
 frequencies, these synaptic changes are unlikely to affect cerebellar function. Therefore,
 spontaneous and BDNF-associated reinnervation form functional synapses with
 associated functional recovery.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2099/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2099/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How does a clinical governance framework contribute to the changing role of nurse leaders in Fiji?</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Lee</field><field name="description">The incidence of adverse clinical events in health care organisations is an
 international problem. While intense interest has focused on this issue world-wide,
 with various responses including the introduction of clinical governance in developed
 countries, it has been less of a focus in developing countries, where the struggle to
 provide minimal resources for health care is often a priority. In Fiji, with the
 introduction of health reform funded by international aid agencies, improving patient
 care is now topical. The role of nurses, and particularly leaders in the nursing
 profession, is of paramount importance in the goal to provide better and safer health
 care to communities. Research shows that a key component of the successful
 implementation of clinical governance is effective clinical leadership. My main
 interest with this study was about the impact of nursing leadership. While extensive
 research has been conducted into the impact of nurses on safer care and better health
 services, this has not yet extended into developing countries such as those in the
 Western Pacific. There is a gap, therefore, in knowledge about how nursing
 leadership, and the nursing profession, effects health care policy and practice leading
 to better patient care in this region.
 
 This critical ethnography set out to expand understanding about the role that nursing
 leadership has in improving patient care in Fiji. The study pursued the question:
 &#8216;How does a clinical governance framework contribute to the changing role of nurse
 leaders in Fiji?&#8217; The study had three specific objectives: 1) To undertake a critical
 literature review of the application of clinical governance principles within both
 developing and developed countries, with particular emphasis on the impact for
 nursing leaders; 2) To undertake a study of the evolution of nursing leadership in Fiji;
 3) To critically investigate the situation for nurse leaders in Fiji, as the health care
 system embraced a continuous improvement framework and increased leadership
 accountability for effective nursing practice.
 
 With the recognition that organisational life is socially constructed and that the nurse
 leaders functioned within the bureaucratic structure of the Fiji Ministry of Health,
 social constructionism formed a basis for this research. Taking a critical theory
 approach with the research proved vital, given Fiji&#8217;s extensive history of colonization and the intention that participants had an opportunity for positive social change if they
 so chose. From a methodological perspective, Carspecken&#8217;s (1996) five recommended
 stages for critical qualitative research provided a framework within which the study
 was conducted, analysed and used to partially explain findings. Habermas&#8217;s theory of
 communicative action (1984) comprised the analytical lens through which participant
 interview data, field notes and various official documents and media reports were
 explored.
 
 This critical ethnography involved conducting interviews with six nurse leaders in Fiji
 over a two-year period and extensive time spent with staff of the Fiji Ministry of
 Health. The participants in this study were all experienced nurse leaders who held
 senior leadership positions, either in hospitals and community health services, or in
 the Head Office of the Ministry. During the interviews, participants shared extensive
 information about what it meant to be a nurse leader in Fiji, and what the impact of
 clinical governance was having on their professional lives. Attention to postcolonial
 issues was vital throughout the conduct, analysis and writing up of this research. The
 participants were all indigenous Fijians and spoke explicitly about the effect of
 colonization on the nursing profession in that country. I carried a heavy responsibility
 to appreciate the issues inherent in conducting the research as a non-indigenous
 researcher.
 
 Analysis from a critical perspective revealed three major themes, which are presented
 as distinct but related chapters in the thesis. The themes are: Findings our voices:
 understanding that we are powerful; Legitimizing our role as the facilitators of best
 patient outcomes; and Recognition of our capacity to take a leading role in health
 care. Themes are presented from the perspective of the participants&#8217; narratives as
 well as field notes and documents, with my interpretations, based upon the
 Carspecken methodology and a Habermasian reading of the data. The findings are
 presented initially from the perspective of the analytic themes and the literature
 comprehensively reviewed. They are then discussed in terms of the literature
 identifying a link between effective nursing leadership, nursing conditions and
 optimum safe patient care.
 
 The recommendations from the study are identified as they emanate from the findings
 and include those concerning nursing leadership, education, nursing practice and
 patient care, as well as recommendations for potential further research.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2100/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2100/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hit scrape click drag: analysis and application of compositional methods at the intersection of conserved and emergent technologies</field><field name="creator">Hill, Matthew</field><field name="description">The creation of music incorporating emergent technologies has occurred throughout
 history across a range of styles. In the past fifty years advances in electronic and, more
 recently, digital technologies have led to a range of new music making practices. Most
 recently, rapid advances in computer technology have enabled the results of complex
 digital manipulations of sound to be heard in real time, allowing the computer to
 become a powerful live performance and composition tool. As new technologies
 emerge, new musical forms based on various levels of synthesis of pre-composed and
 improvisation based composition methods are developed. This research seeks to
 identify, define, categorise, explore and develop compositional methods in which
 traditional composition techniques and emergent technologies intersect.
 
 The research has historical, analytical and personal practice components and is situated
 in the fields of music analysis, music technology and composition. The deficiencies of
 existing analytical methodologies are discussed with particular reference to emergent
 technologies, music creation, recording practice, and interdisciplinary theoretical issues.
 A text-based, parametric analysis method is developed and applied to thirty-six selected
 key works in electronic/electroacoustic, improvised, rock and electronic dance music
 (EDM) genres. The works analysed originate from the USA, Europe and the UK and
 span the past seventy years. The analytical method considers the processes, shaping
 factors (i.e., contextual or extramusical elements) and inputs (i.e., textual or musical
 elements) involved in the creation of works and is intended to address both conserved
 and emergent technological elements. Observations made by the researcher are included
 alongside those from the literature.
 
 The detailed analyses of the thirty-six selected key works are included as an Appendix,
 with a summary mapping of genre terrain included in the thesis. Whilst some
 generalisations about works within genres and between genres are made, the
 compositional methods identified constitute a complex and diverse set of music making
 practices. In general terms, in electronic, rock and EDM genres, traditional roles of
 composer, performer, producer and engineer are blurred, with individual artists moving
 between such roles. In improvised works a distinction between performer/composer and
 engineer is apparent. In more specific terms, the use of historically emergent sound
 sources distinguishes most of the electronic works at a timbral level. In some cases in
 the electronic genre, the sound source is an important conceptual driver for the structure
 of the works. In other genres, emergent sound sources often lead to an expansion of
 existing forms or used to supplement, or substitute for, traditional instrumentation.
 
 The research makes a direct and explicit link between music analysis and music
 creation. The insights gained from the analyses are applied to the creation of eight new
 musical works: four genre-specific studies and four major works. Recordings of the
 practical works are presented, alongside video documentation of the rehearsal,
 performance and recording of the major works, on an accompanying DVD. A
 compartmentalised and hybridised approach to composition is utilised, drawing directly
 from the parametric analysis method. The practical works feature both solo and group
 ensembles and incorporate traditional instrumentation and digitally sampled and
 synthesised elements. A range of individual and collaborative &#8216;top down&#8217; and &#8216;bottom
 up&#8217; processes are explored. A computer based performance instrument (CBPI) is
 developed using the software Max/MSP. The CBPI embeds compositional elements
 identified in the analyses (relating to sound source, sound processing, rhythm, pitch, texture, and spatial elements), and is utilised in the creation of the major works. The
 compositional approach crystallises and extends many aspects of past personal practice.
 The eight practical works represent some of the possibilities of both the CBPI and the
 analysis/creation model.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2101/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2101/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effectiveness of recreational only fishing areas in North Queensland estuaries for reducing conflict and improving recreational catches
 
</field><field name="creator">Tobin, Renae C.</field><field name="description">Allocation of fisheries resources to recreational fishers via Recreational Only Fishing
 Areas (ROFAs) is becoming increasingly common in all developed countries,
 particularly in coastal areas. ROFAs are often introduced with the expectation that such
 action will segregate competing recreational and commercial fishers (by excluding
 commercial fishers) and thus resolve apparent conflict over previously shared fisheries
 resources. ROFAs also have the expected benefit of improving recreational catch
 quality for previously shared species. Whether these benefits are realised, however, is
 unknown because little monitoring of outcomes occurs post-ROFA implementation.
 
 Using questionnaires of recreational and commercial fishers and collection of
 fishery-dependent and fishery-independent recreational catch data, this study
 investigated the outcomes of ROFAs in north Queensland estuaries. Specifically, the
 study examined: the nature and source of conflict between recreational and
 commercial fishers competing for shared barramundi stocks; whether current estuarine
 ROFAs are successful in segregating and reducing conflict between these sectors; and
 whether ROFAs result in improved recreational catches of barramundi.
 
 Results from the questionnaires show that while recreational fishers (anglers)
 have high expectations of ROFAs and would like more implemented, most anglers are
 unaware of locations of current ROFAs, and do not deliberately choose to use them.
 Consequently, current ROFAs are not increasing segregation of recreational and
 commercial fishers. Moreover, contact between the recreational and commercial
 sectors appears to already be limited due to time segregation (commercial netting is
 not allowed in estuaries on weekends) and the finding that most commercial fishers
 avoid areas heavily occupied by recreational fishers. Thus the conflict between these
 sectors does not appear to be due to high levels of direct contact.
 
 Investigations of the perceptions of fishers from both sectors via the
 questionnaire program revealed that the underlying conflict between commercial and
 recreational fishers in north Queensland appears to be based on mutual
 misperceptions of the competing sector&#8217;s operations and impacts, particularly from
 anglers. Such misperceptions lead to blame (i.e. anglers blame commercial fishers) for
 negative outcomes such as (real or perceived) catch declines. ROFAs do not address
 this problem of mutual misperceptions of fishers and are therefore unlikely to resolve
 this conflict in the long-term. Increased communication between sectors and education
 from fisheries managers and researchers and stakeholder representatives regarding
 each sector&#8217;s operations and impacts on the resource is more likely to reduce conflict. Such actions should reduce misperceptions, adjusting attitudes of fishers to be more
 positive towards the competing sector, and hence reducing conflict.
 
 Despite anecdotal claims and expectations of improved recreational catches of
 barramundi in ROFAs compared to open estuaries in north Queensland, fishery dependent
 (from charter fishing records, voluntary recreational catch logbooks, and
 personal fisher time series records) and fishery-independent (in the form of structured
 fishing surveys) recreational catch data collected though this study did not reveal
 improvements in catch per unit effort or success rates for barramundi in ROFAs.
 Results did show that the average size of barramundi caught in ROFAs was larger than
 those caught in the open estuaries, though the reason for this difference in size
 structure is unknown. Further investigation into why recreational catch benefits are not
 being realised and what this may mean for barramundi populations is required. Results
 imply natural variation may be more influential on barramundi populations than fishing,
 or that recreational fishing is highly variable and not a good indicator of stock structure
 and abundance.
 
 Overall, results of this project suggest current estuarine ROFAs in north
 Queensland are not resulting in the expected benefits: i.e. they are not reducing conflict
 between recreational and commercial fishers or resulting in improved recreational
 catches of barramundi. This study highlights the importance of determining the source
 of conflict, and collecting quality time-series recreational catch data before and after
 ROFA implementation. Future studies should aim to examine both the costs and
 expected benefits of ROFAs to determine whether benefits outweigh the costs
 involved. Costs and benefits should be examined from a multi-disciplinary approach,
 including social, ecological and economic aspects.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2102/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2102/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Selecting medical students: personality as a potential predictor</field><field name="creator">Knights, Janice Anna</field><field name="description">The major aims of this research were to investigate the predictive validity of the selection components used by the JCU School of Medicine (JCUSOM), to explore the potential of personality to predict academic performance, and to investigate the incremental validity of both selection components and personality. The JCUSOM offers an innovative undergraduate program that is vertically and horizontally integrated, and utilises group learning methods of instruction. It had its first intake of students in 2000 and by 2002, a total of 212 students were enrolled in the medical program. Upon entry, participants were between 16 and 21 years of age, and gender and cohort distributions were approximately equal. The overall theoretical relationship between personality and academic performance was based on the PPIK model (intelligence-as process, personality, interests, intelligence-as-knowledge). Within this framework, the relationship between personality and academic performance was approached from three distinct aspects: 1) personality traits within the framework of the Five-Factor Model of personality, 2) patterns of dysfunctional behaviour with the framework of the DSM-III personality disorders, and 3) motives, values and interests within the framework of the RIASEC typology of personality and environments, and the motivating effects of values. The research undertaken was of a multi-point design with personality data being collected at the same time each year over a three-year period. For statistical purposes, in order to have an equivalent number of students completing each of the first three years of training, grades data were collected for a five-year period. The research project comprised one study that investigated the predictive and incremental validity of the existing selection components (OP ranks, written application and selection interview) and the three distinct aspects of personality, in relation to academic grades. The selection criteria and grades data were archival data, and I collected the personality data. Personality traits were measured using the Hogan Personality Inventory (HPI), patterns of dysfunctional interpersonal behaviours were measured using the Hogan Development Survey (HDS), and motives, values and vocational interests were measured using the Motives, Values and Preferences Inventory (MVPI). Predictive validity was analysed using Pearson bivariate correlations and incremental validity was analysed using hierarchical regression analyses. The regression analyses also accounted for the confounding variables of age and gender. The results indicated that gender and OP ranks were consistent predictors of academic grades across each year of the medical program, and of average performance. The interview criteria relating to interpersonal, self-reliance and communication also had predictive and incremental validity at various stages of training. Conversely, the written application data were not predictive of grades. In relation to the personality data, motives/values/ and interests had no predictive power, while personality traits had predictive validity but lacked incremental validity. While all patterns of dysfunctional interpersonal behaviour had predictive validity, only the syndromes of Away and Against showed incremental validity. My research has illustrated how an organizational psychology approach can be applied to medical selection, by validating criteria through systematic, theory-driven research. It has highlighted the need for medical schools to pay attention to the incremental validity of their selection components, and has provided valuable information that can be used to improve the cost-effectiveness of the JCU selection process.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2107/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2107/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Artificial intelligent system for integrated wear debris and vibration analysis in machine condition monitoring</field><field name="creator">Ebersbach, Stephan</field><field name="description">Machine condition monitoring has become a vital component of maintenance programs
 in machine intensive operations, such as the mining, mineral processing and manufacturing
 industries. Vibration and oil analysis have become the two most commonly
 used techniques for fault detection and tracking. These techniques are generally used
 independently as expert knowledge is required in each field, and due to a lack of understanding
 about how to integrate them. However, numerous case studies of machine
 failures have reported on the benefit of a correlated approach. This project focused
 on the development of an analytical strategy that, for the first time analyses vibration
 data in conjunction with oil and wear debris data for machine health assessment.
 
 In order to achieve the goal of developing a strategy for correlated application of
 vibration, oil and wear particle analysis using artificial intelligence, a number of project
 objectives were identified. The project objectives were to investigate the fault detection
 abilities of condition monitoring techniques as a basis for developing a correlated strategy,
 and finally to implement this strategy using artificial intelligence. These objectives
 were collated into a project plan that consisted of a comprehensive survey of condition
 monitoring techniques and correlation investigation, correlation strategy development,
 expert system development and a testing phase.
 
 The project was performed in a number of stages to allow the progress to be monitored.
 The first stage comprised a thorough literature review to ascertain the current
 research status in the condition monitoring field, as well as confirming the project objectives.
 The second and third stages were concerned with the preparation of spur and
 worm gearbox laboratory test rigs, and the operation of suitable experiments. The
 measured condition monitoring data allowed the fault detection of the vibration, oil and wear particle analysis techniques to be assessed. The data was also used for verification
 of the correlation strategy developed in stage four. Stage five was concerned
 with the development of three expert systems for vibration analysis, oil and wear particle
 analysis, and correlated condition analysis respectively. The expert system for
 correlated condition analysis was constructed using the correlation strategy of stage
 four of the project. All expert systems were thoroughly tested using laboratory and
 industry derived data to verify correct operation.
 
 The outcomes of this research project contribute to the current academic knowledge
 of the condition monitoring field, as well as provide industry with potential economic
 and environmental benefits. The novel strategy for correlation of vibration, oil and
 wear particle analysis techniques, as well as the demonstration of the effectiveness of
 the developed expert systems are contributed to the academic research community.
 The expert systems include additional innovative features such as a fault root-cause
 analysis algorithm, and a new strategy for machine remaining lifetime estimation using
 a wear approach that can be updated using condition monitoring data. The fully
 functional expert system software package complete with user interface is contributed
 to the industry partner Industrial and Technical Services for potential future commercialisation.
 
 The developments of this project can provide significant benefits to the mining, mineral
 processing and manufacturing industries if the project outcomes are implemented.
 The correlated condition monitoring strategy allows improved early fault detection,
 more reliable fault diagnosis and the ability to perform root-cause analysis, compared
 to conventional vibration, oil and wear particle analysis. These advances combine to
 improve the efficiency of the maintenance program resulting in increasing machine uptime,
 reduced maintenance costs and lower environmental impact. The adoption of
 the project developments could therefore ultimately improve the profitability of the
 venture, and help Australian operations to remain financially viable on a global scale.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2109/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2109/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A critique of post modernism(s) in nursing literature from the perspective of Habermas' critical theory</field><field name="creator">Bugeja, Irene</field><field name="description">The aim of the thesis was to examine the strengths and weaknesses of postmodernism(s) and the influence it had on the nursing discourse. This was to be achieved by using Fairclough&#8217;s critical discourse analysis to examine the nursing literature. A literature search was conducted on major data bases of nursing journals, and after inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied 167 articles became the data for the study. The order of the discourse revealed that the dominant features included the following findings: 75% of the articles make reference to the theme of power; Foucault was the dominant theorist; and 73% of the articles were published in five nursing journals.
 
 Further analysis was conducted concerning the theme of power relating to articles that utilised Foucault and postmodern critical theory. Articles that drew primarily from Foucault articulate an approach to power that exhibits high levels of consistency. This was not the case when Foucault was used in conjunction with other theorists or in the case of the postmodern critical theory articles. These articles included a high level of variation, confusion and contradiction. The Foucauldian critique of critical theory has had a profound impact on the discourse and this was particularly evident concerning issues relating to emancipation, empowerment and reflection. From the Foucauldian perspective these concepts were considered to be overly ambitious and privileged particular groups. In the case of reflection they undermined the &#8216;self&#8217; by engaging in self-surveillance. Stripped of their emancipatory agenda, the postmodern critical theory articles lose their raison d'&#234;tre.
 
 The findings have been interpreted using a framework based on Habermas&#8217; critical theory concerning his theories of communicative action and instrumental rationality. Further impact on the discourse emanates from societal and contextual issues concerning publishing and government funding since the discourse almost entirely originates from the university sector. This reveals that the postmodern nursing discourse, as a whole, is marginalised through issues relating to journal &#8216;impact factor&#8217; ratings and research quality frameworks.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2116/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2116/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Psychobiological predictors of exercise behaviour in
 postmenopausal women</field><field name="creator">Barnett, Fiona</field><field name="description">Weight gain and the associated increased risk of obesity-related diseases are associated with the postmenopausal period. However, moderate intensity exercise may be protective for postmenopausal women through attenuation of weight gain. Despite this evidence, many postmenopausal women do not engage in regular exercise.
 
 As exercise has a positive effect on body composition and the subsequent health of postmenopausal females, an understanding of why exercise levels decline in this
 population is needed. In particular, understanding the difference in exercise behaviour characteristics of exercising and non-exercising postmenopausal women
 may encourage more non-exercising postmenopausal women to obtain the health benefits of exercise. An understanding of the exercise behaviour characteristics of exercising and non-exercising postmenopausal women may also provide
 information for future health promotion policy directions for this population and allow for the formulation of guidelines for exercise professionals. It appears that the
 life event of menopause can become a barrier or an opportunity for postmenopausal women to exercise, depending on their exercise behaviour characteristics.
 
 Postmenopausal women (N=101) resident in North Queensland volunteered for this study. A self-report questionnaire was utilised to determine the participants&#8217; recent exercise history. Participants completed two exercise behaviour scales. The Selfefficacy for Exercise Scale is a barrier-specific, thirteen-item instrument listing common reasons for preventing participation in exercise. The Health Belief Model(HBM) scale required participants to indicate how much they agreed or disagreed with various statements relating to their individual health beliefs related to exercise
 and obesity.
 
 Anthropometric assessments ascertained body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio.Resting heart rate and blood pressure were also measured. Participants then performed a six minute graded exercise test (GXT) to determine estimated
 maximum oxygen uptake (V&amp; O2max). A second visit required participants to perform a twenty minute moderate intensity exercise bout on a cycle ergometer while measures of pre, during and post-exercise affect were obtained using the Subjective Exercise Experience Scale (SEES).
 
 Following data collection, participants were categorised as exercisers (n=53) or non-exercisers (n=48) based on whether they had performed a minimum of 150 minutes of accumulated moderate intensity exercise in the past 7 days. Univariate
 and multivariate statistical tests including discriminant function analysis (DFA) were utilised to determine whether significant between-group differences existed for the physiological and psychological variables.
 
 The non-exercisers had obtained a lower level of education (U = 971.5, p = .03),were at a lower stage of exercise change (U = 308.0, p = .00), had higher resting diastolic blood pressure (F1,99=7.57, p=0.01), BMI (F1,99=33.63, p=0.00) and WHR (F1,99=5.83, p=0.02) and lower cardiorespiratory fitness (F1,99=21.57, p=0.00) and exercise self-efficacy (F1,99=39.56, p=0.00) compared to the exercisers. Each of these variables may therefore represent barriers to exercise adoption for this sample of non-exercising postmenopausal women.
 
 DFA determined that the postmenopausal women with higher exercise self-efficacy,lower BMI and higher cardiorespiratory fitness were more likely to be exercisers.
 DFA also found that the barrier to exercise items of perceived lack of time,difficulty getting to an exercise location and the weather provided the greatest discrimination between exercisers and non-exercisers.
 
 Further analysis of exercise self-efficacy revealed that participants at different stages of change possessed different levels of exercise self-efficacy. Participants
 with the lowest exercise self-efficacy were in the precontemplation and contemplation stages of change, while participants with the highest exercise self-efficacy were in the action and maintenance stages.
 
 DFA results for the HBM scale revealed that the non-exercising postmenopausal women had higher perceptions of susceptibility to developing an obesity-related
 disease, perceived a greater number of consequences from participating in regular exercise and felt they were less health motivated to control an obesity-related disease compared to the exercising women.
 
 Separate mixed design repeated measures ANOVA found that no significant between-group differences occurred for positive well-being (SEESa) and fatigue(SEESc)during twenty minutes of moderate intensity exercise. However,follow-up univariate contrasts (Bonferroni)found that the acute exercise bout did have a beneficial effect for both groups across time, with higher SEESa scores postexercise compared to pre and during exercise. Additionally, SEESc scores for both groups were lower postexercise compared to during the latter stages of exercise. Further research on postmenopausal women residing in Australian metropolitan cities is recommended for determining whether the differences found in this study are unique to postmenopausal women residing in regional North Queensland.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2117/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2117/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Natural products and their supply from the tropical sponge Luffariella variabilis</field><field name="creator">Ettinger-Epstein, Piers</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the critical link between the fundamental biology and chemical ecology of the Great Barrier Reef sponge Luffariella variabilis (Pol&#233;jaeff 1884) for the aquaculture based supply of bioactive metabolites. Luffariella variabilis produces manoalide, a high value bioactive sesterterpene used as a molecular probe. The sponge is cryptic and distributed widely through the Indo-Pacific -- this study was done on the central Great Barrier Reef at Orpheus Island in the Palm Islands group, Queensland, Australia where L. variabilis is common.
 
 The first objective of the study was to examine the natural products chemistry of L. variabilis. Three new acetylated compounds, 25-acetoxyluffariellin A, 25-acetoxyluffariellin B and 25-acetoxyseco-manoalide were obtained from L.variabilis and the structures of the three new compounds elucidated on the basis of their spectroscopic data. The known major metabolites, manoalide monoacetate, manoalide, luffariellin A and seco-manoalide were also identified.
 
 The known major metabolites were then monitored temporally and spatially to determine the potential yield from wild harvest or aquaculture. Production of the major metabolites was hardwired with little variation in space and time at the population level in the Palm Islands. Manoalide monoacetate (35 - 70 mg g-1 dry weight of sponge) was always the most abundant compound followed by manoalide (15 - 20 mg g-1 dry weight of sponge). Luffariellin A and secomanoalide were always 10 &#8211;70 times less abundant and varied between 0 &#8211; 3 mg g-1 dry weight of sponge. Collections of L. variabilis made at Davies Reef and Magnetic Island yielded the same rank order and yields of compounds indicating a generality of pattern over at least 100 km. The &#8216;hardwiring&#8217; of metabolite production at the population level by L. variabilis was also reflected in the lack of any inductive effect on metabolite production. In addition, individually monitored sponges produced fixed ratios of the major metabolites over time. However, these ratios varied between individuals with some individuals consistently producing high levels of manoalide and manoalide monoacetate. The potential for selection of high yielding stocks is discussed.
 
 In order to explore the sustainable production of natural products via wild harvest or aquaculture, the reproductive output of L.variabilis was quantified and correlated with sea temperature over two reproductive seasons (2004 and 2005). Luffariella variabilis is gonochoristic and viviparous. Gametogenesis commenced for females at a water temperature of 21 &#186;C, the lowest water temperature of the year, and spermatogenesis occurred above 22.5 &#186;C (with sperm asynchronously developed and released from August or September to October). Females asynchronously developed oocytes from July to September, embryos from September to December, and larvae from November to December. Female reproduction terminated in December (after larval release) prior to the highest mean annual water temperature of 30 &#186;C in January. There was a significant (30 %) decrease in female reproductive output in 2005 compared to 2004 as measured by the reproductive index (0.91 &#177; 0.14 female reproductive propagules mm-2 of choanoderm in 2005 compared with 1.27 &#177; 0.11 mm-2 in 2004). This corresponded with delayed oogensis and spermatogenesis, and a shortened larval development cycle because of a delayed minimum temperature (21 &#186;C) in August of 2005 compared with July 2004. Correspondingly, the maximum percentage of the choanoderm occupied by female reproductive propagules (eggs, embryos and larvae) was also reduced by 33 % in 2005 (5.09 % in October 2004 compared with 3.44 % in October 2005). However, the mean sizes of individual female propagules remained the same from year to year. Males in contrast, showed no overall difference in either reproductive index or percentage occupation of the
 choanoderm between 2004 and 2005. The significantly lower reproductive output (~30 %) for L. variabilis associated with delayed minimum water temperatures has significant implications for population reproductive success where oogenesis, spermatogenesis and larval release are cued by minimum and maximum water temperatures, given the predicted increases in water temperatures associated with climate change.
 
 Determining the settlement responses of L.variabilis larvae is crucial in determining on-growth potential for aquaculture. The response of L. variabilis larvae to a hierarchy of settlement cues was examined from mid-November to late December 2005. Light cued the daytime release (0700 &#8211; 1600 hrs) of up to 830 larvae day-1 sponge-1 over 5 &#8211; 6 weeks. Newly released larvae initially swam upwards. However, at 20 - 40 min post release, larvae exhibited a clear negative phototaxis and light strongly influenced their settlement. Irradiance levels of 55 &#956;mol m-2 s-1 and 14 &#956;mol m-2 s-1 slowed the settlement rate of larvae and inhibited overall settlement after 18 hours by ~ 60 % and 35 % respectively compared with controls. The rate of settlement and overall settlement were still significantly reduced at irradiances of &gt;3 &#956;mol m-2 s-1. This corroborated with the adult distribution of L. variabilis in dark areas. Luffariella variabilis larvae are gregarious settlers with increasing rates of settlement and overall settlement with increasing densities of larvae. Gregarious settlement of L. variabilis larvae is associated with a conspecific larval settlement cue(s). Individual and groups of ten larvae placed in &#8216;conditioned&#8217; water (water in which 200 larvae had previously settled) initially settled faster than controls. Furthermore, this effect was highest on single larvae with a four fold increase in overall settlement. While the rate of settlement was faster for groups of ten larvae, overall settlement totals were similar to those of controls. In contrast, cues often associated with invertebrate larval settlement such as biofilms, crustose corraline algae and adult conspecifics had no effect on settlement at any time.
 
 In summary, the production of the major L. variabilis metabolites was fixed in time and space. Manoalide monoaceteate and manoalide were produced in high amounts making the sponge an ideal target for either wild harvest or aquaculture. Luffariella variabilis is gonochoristic, released sperm in August, September and October and asynchronously brooded embryos over six months culminating with larval release in November and December. Larvae settled rapidly in the dark and at faster overall rates, and higher overall totals with increasing density. This was because settling larvae release a settlement cue (although there was no effect of other common invertebrate settlement cues). The rapid settlement of larvae in dark areas corroborates with the adult distribution of the sponge and strongly suggests that biomass of L. variabilis for the production of manoalide could be augmented by ongrowth and culture of larvae.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2118/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2118/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Literacy upgrading: issues of transition for adult males in British Columbia</field><field name="creator">Derby, Brendan</field><field name="description">This study sets out to explore the realities and dilemmas of several adult males experiencing transition from a rural setting to an urban and academic setting. Efforts to explain the origin, significance and complexities of this experience reveal much about transitions in adult education. As there is a marked absence of theoretical literature on transitions in adult education, this study integrates various theoretical conceptions. The case study approach used in this study is largely exploratory and aimed at stimulating further discussion. This study integrates theory drawn from a diverse range of literatures such as sociology, rurality, education and culture. Discussion of these theoretical contributions in combination with data drawn from the narratives of the participants reveals that transitions in adult education are not autonomous experiences. On the contrary, transitions are tied to an integrated pattern of social, cultural, political and economic institutions, structures and processes. The participants&#8217; interactions with these institutions, structures and processes over the course of their lives reveals much about the intimate relationship between culture, power and ideology in affecting rural social and cultural conditions as well as their transitions to the urban and academic setting.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2121/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2121/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clustering algorithms for disease classification using mass spectrometry data</field><field name="creator">Chandramohan, Vikram</field><field name="description">Besides the availability of genomic data, life-science researchers study proteomics
 in order to gain insight into the functions of cells by learning how proteins are expressed,
 processed, recycled, and their localization in cells. Proteomics are defined
 as the study of proteome which refers to the entire set of expressed proteins in a cell.
 In particular, functional proteomics involves the use of mass spectrometry (MS) to
 study the regulation, timing, and location of protein expression. It has been recently
 realized that the use of MS coupled with pattern recognition methodology can offer
 tremendous potential for the early detection of complex human diseases, and
 biomarker discovery. However, given the promising integration of several machine learning
 methods and MS data in high-throughput proteomics, this biotechnology
 field still encounters several challenges in order to become a mature platform for
 clinical diagnostics and protein-based biomarker profiling. Some of the major challenges
 include noise filtering of MS data, feature extraction, feature reduction of MS
 datasets and selection of computational methods for MS-based classification. The
 main objective of this research is to classify diseases using MS data. First, we investigated
 feature extraction of MS data based on the fundamentals of signal processing
 such as the theory of linear predictive coding. Then we present an unsupervised
 kernel based fuzzy c-means (KFCM) approach, which is shown to be more robust
 to noise than fuzzy c-means (FCM) for mass spectrometry dataset. The KFCM is
 realized by modifying the original Euclidean distance in FCM by a kernel-induced

 popular classification techniques such as support vector machine (SVM), principle
 component analysis (PCA), linear or quadratic discriminate analysis (LDA/QDA)
 and random forests.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2122/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2122/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ground detection sensor for cane harvester base-cutter height control</field><field name="creator">Page, Rayner Luke</field><field name="description">The harvesting of sugar cane is the first stage in the commercial milling of sugar cane to produce sugar and plays a major role in determining the overall efficiency of the sugar production process. In Australia, where virtually all sugar cane is harvested using mechanical harvesters, efficient operation of the harvester is essential to reduce operating costs. One area of harvesting that has, on numerous occasions, been identified as an impediment to improved harvester efficiency is the adjustment of the base cutter height. Improper setting during harvesting has a number of serious consequences for sugar production including reduced production, crop damage, additional harvester running costs and inefficient transportation and milling of the sugar cane due to the introduction of dirt. 
 
 The overall aim of this thesis was to develop a ground detection sensor based on microwave radar technology that could sense ground level in front of a working sugar cane harvester. The eventual purpose of such a device would be to automatically control the cutting height to the optimum level and thus improving the efficiency of the harvesting, farming and milling processes.
 
 The measurement technique investigated is based upon the use of a radio transmitter and receiver positioned on either side of the row of sugar cane. The principle of this design is that a receiver close to ground level would experience more attenuation from the soil than a receiver positioned well above ground level. Thus, it was suggested that changes in the received signal strength with respect to the height above ground level could be used to detect changes in the height of the ground.
 
 The project evolved in two main stages. Initially, work concentrated on verifying the sensing principle in the laboratory and later in the field. Testing verified the proposed measurement procedure with the following major conclusions. Firstly, for best results a radio signal of 2-3GHz polarised horizontal to the ground was most suitable. This signal provided the best compromise between being insensitive to the presence of the sugar cane while still allowing practical sized antennas to be employed. Secondly, field-testing showed that the sugar cane stalks do affect the ideal sensor response with the orientation and condition (density, leaf matter, etc) of the sugar cane having a noticeable influence on the measurements. These results suggested that a practical sensor would need to incorporate automatic compensation for the variations in the sugar cane and that some averaging or signal processing would have to be applied to remove the underlying trends.
 
 The second stage of the project involved building a prototype sensor and testing it on a working sugar cane harvester. The prototype worked by measuring the received amplitude of a 2.4GHz, horizontally polarised microwave radio signal that was transmitted from one side of the sugar cane row to the other. For this application, multiple receivers are stacked vertically to measure the full height profile instantaneously. The idea of using multiple receivers with some positioned well above the ground level, was to compensate for the changing density of the sugar cane. The transmitter and receiver antennas were based on rectangular microstrip patch antenna arrays. The low profile of these patch antennas meant that they were ideal for flush mounting on the harvesters&#8217; crop divider walls. Dedicated transmitter and receiver electronics was also needed to generate and detect the microwave radio signals used by this system. A full control system and data logger was developed for this application.
 
 The prototype sensor that was developed was trialled on an Austoft harvester over a one week period in the Burnett region. These tests were used to confirm that the sensor would work and that it could survive the harsh conditions experienced during harvesting. 
 
 Overall, the aim of this thesis was to test the potential of the microwave ground height detection sensor for automated control of the base cutter height on sugar cane harvester and to develop a plan to use this technology in a commercial base cutter height control system.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2123/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2123/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biogeography and macroecology of benthic marine algae</field><field name="creator">Kerswell, Ailsa P.</field><field name="description">Macroecologists strive to understand the distribution and abundance of species over wide spatial

 are generated. Algal genera exhibit an inverse latitudinal gradient, with biodiversity hotspots in
 temperate regions, while bryopsidalean species reach peak diversity in the tropics. The
 geographic distribution of range locations results in distinct clusters of range mid-points. In
 particular, widespread taxa are centred within tight latitudinal and longitudinal bands in the
 middle of the Indo-Pacific and Atlantic Oceans while small-ranged taxa are clustered in
 peripheral locations. I assessed a suite of hypotheses about the causes of marine diversity
 gradients by comparing algal richness patterns, in combination with the size and location of
 algal geographic ranges, to the richness and range locations predicted by these hypotheses. The
 results implicate habitat areas and ocean currents as the most plausible drivers of global marine
 algae diversity patterns.
 
 Species richness patterns of macroalgae in the order Bryopsidales are strikingly concordant with
 those of corals and reef fishes throughout the tropical Indo-Pacific Ocean. In order to understand
 the processes that create and maintain tropical marine diversity gradients, I used the 
 Bryopsidales to test the generality of a model recently developed for coral and reef fish
 biodiversity. Model selection was used to select the energy-related variables which best
 predicted species richness. These were then included along with reef area and an estimate of the
 mid-domain effect in spatial regression models of species richness. The results confirm the role
 of geographic domain boundaries as a major predictor of marine species richness patterns across
 a variety of taxa. They also indicate that the relative importance of environmental variables may
 differ with the taxa in question, with temperature and nitrate being key predictors of algal
 richness compared to reef area for corals and fishes. Moreover, even though the best models
 differ for algae versus corals and fishes, the richness patterns predicted by each model deviate
 from the observed patterns in a consistent manner. This suggests that additional factors, not
 included in any of the models, are also important in shaping species richness for multiple
 tropical taxa in the Indo-Pacific Ocean. I propose several candidate factors that may fulfil this
 role.
 
 A long running controversy in community ecology concerns the extent to which species
 interactions influence the structure of assemblages. I examined assemblage structure in marine
 macroalgal communities at a variety of spatial scales in order to test for the existence of
 Wilson&#8217;s (1989) guild proportionality assembly rule and to identify the geographical scales at
 which this rule operates. In order to overcome limitations of the traditional guild-by-guild tests
 of Wilson (1989), I developed a new guild proportionality test, which examines communities in
 the aggregate. The functional group composition of algal assemblages was determined for 120
 local assemblages using the global database of marine macroalgae distribution records. Using a
 hierarchy of models and the newly developed guild proportionality test, I examined patterns of
 assemblage structure at scales ranging from regional to global. Observed communities were
 compared to null models, which assumed that species occurred in assemblages independently of
 one another (i.e., &#8220;random&#8221; assemblage structure). These comparisons revealed highly nonrandom
 structure in algal assemblages at all scales. Communities were more similar than
 predicted under a random assembly model within tropical regions and throughout the tropical
 biome, indicating the existence of guild proportionality within these scales. In contrast,
 communities were more heterogeneous than predicted in all temperate areas, within oceans and
 across the globe. These patterns suggest that species interactions homogenize assemblage
 structure within the tropics, but extrinsic processes such as regional environment and historical
 contingency play an important role in shaping how assemblages vary within temperate regions
 and at very broad spatial scales.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2124/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2124/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cadmium accumulation in the barnacle biomonitor Balanus amphitrite: combining field and laboratory observations with modelling</field><field name="creator">da Silva, Eduardo Teixeira</field><field name="description">The present study addressed the need to understand how short-term variations in metal
 concentrations in the environment determine its concentrations in a biomonitor, and how this
 information affects the use of the biomonitor in environmental monitoring programs. As a
 case study, the barnacle biomonitor Balanus amphitrite present in Ross Creek (Townsville,
 Queensland, AU) and the heavy metal Cd were used. The research methodology for this study
 comprised three integrated approaches: field measurements; the performance of laboratory experiments, and the development of an ecotoxicological simulation model, in order to
 understand the processes controlling Cd accumulation in Balanus amphitrite in the field. Two
 sampling programs were carried out along Ross Creek, in the dry season of 2002 and the wet
 season of 2004, in which barnacles, their food sources (two class sizes of suspended
 particulate material, SPM, and microzooplankton) and water (dissolved phase) were sampled
 weekly for Cd concentrations and mass abundances. Sampling periods were selected to test
 whether the concentration of Cd in the biomonitor responded to any variation in the dissolved
 and particulate phase Cd concentrations in Ross Creek, as caused by rainfall variation.
 
 In both sampling periods, the Cd concentration in the dissolved phase increased upstream,
 ranging from 1.6 to 283 ngl,", The Cd concentration in the barnacle's food sources exhibited
 the same pattern - ranging from &lt;0.01 to 2.10 mg kg" for the small size class of SPM (0.4550
 um), from 0.07 to 1.62mg kg" for large SPM (50-200 um), and from 0.03 to 0.80 mg kg-I
 for microzooplankton (50-200 um). The Cd concentration in two populations of Balanus
 amphitrite increased upstream between two sites 2.20 km apart and ranged from 2.15 to 6.40
 mg kg" and from 5.22 to 12.8mg kg-I. Even though no significant temporal variation was
 detected for the Cd sources to the barnacles, the biomonitor Cd concentrations varied over the
 three sampling months, within each sampling period, exhibiting specific patterns for this
 variation. These observations suggest that changes in the Cd concentrations in the food
 sources and the relative mass abundance of these sources may result in a specific Cd
 concentration in Balanus amphitrite.
 
 Similar Cd concentrations, within sites, were observed for the particles between the dry and
 wet seasons. Only the most contaminated site exhibited significant differences in the
 dissolved Cd concentration between seasons. Because more than 95% of the total Cd in the
 Ross Creek water &lt;200 um) was in the dissolved phase &lt;0.45 um), the differences in the
 dissolved Cd concentration resulted in the barnacles from the most Cd-contaminated site
 being exposed to a total Cd concentration in the wet season (45.8 ng L-I) that was a half of
 that in the dry season (91.6 ng L-I) . Such Cd differences were not indicated by the biomonitor
 whose Cd concentration did not vary significantly between dry (8.4 mg kg") and wet (7.4 mg
 kg") seasons. A budget analysis based on Thomann's bioenergetic kinetic model, indicated
 that Cd flux from food contributes &gt;80% of the Cd concentration in Balanus amphitrite.
 Thus, because no significant variation was identified for the Cd concentration in the food, no
 variation in the Cd concentration in the biomonitor was observed at the most contaminated
 site between seasons. A sensitivity analysis on the model showed that physiological
 characteristics of the biomonitor are the key parameters controlling Cd accumulation in
 Balanus amphitrite, rather than the metal concentration in the dissolved or particulate phases.
 This, coupled with the fact that the Cd flux from food is the major source of Cd to Balanus
 amphitrite suggests no tight coupling between Cd in the biomonitor and its availability in the
 environment.
 
 A simulation model was developed based on Thomann's bioenergetic kinetic model. The
 daily-simulated Cd concentration in Balanus amphitrite produced by the model reproduced
 the general trend observed in the field. However, even though high and low patterns of Cd
 concentration in this organism could be reproduced by the model, it could not reproduce the
 short-term temporal variations accurately. A model investigation suggested that variations in
 the mean weight of the sampled barnacles might mask the real pattern of temporal variation of
 the barnacles Cd concentration; even though no size effect has been identified in the field
 data.
 
 Two simulation exercises indicated that Balanus amphitrite may present some weakness in
 indicating temporal variations in Cd concentrations in the environment. The model results
 suggested that this organism could not indicate a 6-month Cd-pulse in the environment that
 increased the Cd concentration in its main source (small SPM, 0.45-50 um) by a factor of 2.8
 using a realistic sampling effort. In addition, this organism took more than a year to reach
 equilibrium for its Cd concentration in a simulated relocation experiment. These problems
 may be critical for the use of Balanus amphitrite as a biomonitor, and suggest that this
 organism can only provides a poor measure of current bioavailability of the metal in the
 environment. However, if a long-term mean Cd availability in the particulate fraction (sized
 &lt;200 um) is required, Balanus amphitrite can provide such an information.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2125/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2125/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Element behaviour in inundated actual acid sulfate soils, East Trinity, Cairns</field><field name="creator">Broughton, John D.</field><field name="description">Actual Acid Sulfate Soils (AASS) undergoing inundation with seawater were examined for: 1)
 element distributions; 2) element mobilisation during seawater inundation; 3) the fate of elements
 mobilised during inundation; and 4) element phytoavailability. Seawater inundation is a potential
 method of ameliorating the acidic soil conditions and on-going release of elements in toxic
 concentrations frequently associated with AASS. The key research question to be answered by the
 study was:
 
 What are the effects of seawater inundation on the distribution, hosting, fate and phytoavailability
 of elements in actual acid sulfate soils?
 
 Elements examined were Al, As, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb, Sc, V and Zn. Barium, Ga, Nb, S,
 Ti, and Zr were also frequently determined to assist with interpretation of geochemical processes in
 the ASS. This project focused on the behaviour of elements in selected soil profiles and sites at
 East Trinity, north Queensland. A statistical description of Acid Sulfate Soils (ASS) properties and
 quantitative modelling of the element losses and gains for the entire East Trinity site were beyond
 the scope of the project.
 
 The study site was the Firewood/Magazine Creek catchment of East Trinity. East Trinity is a 900
 ha parcel of coastal lowland opposite Cairns city on Trinity Inlet in North Queensland. In the
 1970s, East Trinity was reclaimed ostensibly for sugar cane production using a 7.2 km bundwall and
 one-way floodgates. The site contained large areas of Potential ASS (PASS) that oxidised and
 acidified during the reclamation to form AASS. AASS is PASS that has acidified (due to oxidation)
 to a soil pH of less than four. PASS typically has near neutral soil pH values. Widespread AASS
 formation led to extensive vegetation death on the site and the discharge of drainage waters with
 high loads of Al, Fe and Zn. Frequent fish kills were reported in creeks receiving waters from the
 AASS. In 2000, the Queensland State Government acquired the site with a view to rehabilitation.
 The ASS rehabilitation method selected used repeated seawater inundation of the AASS and
 management of water quality with lime dosing.
 
 Seawater inundation of AASS theoretically neutralises the soil acidity of, and stops further
 oxidation/starts reduction in, the AASS. By neutralising soil acidity and stopping
 oxidation/starting reduction, seawater inundation addresses the acidity and element mobilisation
 issues that are the source of the environmental harm associated with AASS. However, seawater
 inundation also has the potential to cause a second event of element mobilisation because of the
 formation of reducing conditions in the previously oxidised AASS.
 
 The geochemistry of seawater Inundated AASS (IAASS) had not been documented in the literature.
 Thus, a geochemical characterization of IAASS was developed based on the following principles: 1)
 IAASS formed from AASS, and both IAASS and AASS formed from PASS; therefore IAASS and
 AASS should contain similarly low concentrations of elements (e.g. Co, Mn, and Zn) that are lost
 during PASS oxidation; 2) IAASS would have a near neutral soil pH, because soil acidity would be
 neutralised by seawater inundation; and 3) IAASS would be enriched in Na (particularly in the
 water-soluble and exchangeable fractions) compared to AASS, because of increased contact with
 seawater. Using these principles, ASS matching the proposed properties was identified in an ASS
 profile taken from a seawater inundated area of the Firewood Creek catchment.
 
 The geochemistry of the AASS, IAASS and PASS from Firewood Creek was dominated by Si, Al
 and Fe. Comparison of the ASS compositions with ANZECC and ARMCANZ (2000) sediment
 quality and the NEPC (1999) soil quality guidelines identified environmentally significant
 concentrations of As (&gt; EIL, ISQG-Low), Ni (&gt; ISQL-Low) and V (&gt; EIL).
 
 Isocon Analysis (IA) was used to identify element enrichment/depletion in an inundated (IAASS
 containing) and a non-inundated (AASS containing) ASS profile. IA used the immobile elements
 Ba and Ti to establish the isocon relationship between altered and parent samples. Cobalt, Mn, Ni
 and Zn were extensively depleted from both ASS profiles, likely during PASS oxidation. Sodium
 was depleted in the dry ASS profile and enriched in the wet ASS profile. Iron was depleted from
 the middle sections of both ASS profiles, with the depletion in the wet ASS profile being more
 extensive. The probable cause of the increased depletion of Fe in the wet ASS profile was extended
 periods of reducing conditions caused by more extensive seawater inundation. Copper and Pb
 displayed similar behaviour to Fe, suggesting they were associated with Fe in the ASS, likely by
 sorption onto oxidised Fe phases.
 
 Examination of element hosting using two Sequential Extraction Procedures (SEPs) identified
 reductive dissolution as the geochemical process responsible for Fe depletion in the IAASS. The
 two SEPs were the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) SEP and the Modified BCR (MBCR) SEP.
 Iron was largely hosted by the reducible fraction in the AASS (i.e. oxides). In the IAASS, the size
 of the Fe reducible fraction was smaller by a third compared to the AASS. This indicated that Fe in
 the IAASS was mobilised by the reductive dissolution of Fe oxides during inundation. A
 combination of seawater inundation and organic matter likely generated reducing conditions in the
 inundated ASS profile and was hence the probable cause of the reductive dissolution of the
 oxidised Fe phases.
 
 The Fe mobilised from the IAASS was transported by egressing soil-waters and precipitated in the
 drains servicing the inundated areas. The Fe that precipitated from the egressing waters flocculated as chemical sediments in the drains. The drain sediments consisted of Fe precipitates in various
 states of oxidation/reduction. The geochemistry of the drain sediments was variable, but uniformly
 dominated by Fe, Si, Al and LOI. The mineralogy was largely crystalline and amorphous Fe oxides
 and detrital silicates. Trace element concentrations in the drain sediments were generally low
 compared to the ASS. Arsenic was the only trace element that demonstrated substantial
 enrichment. Comparison of the drain sediment geochemistry with the ANZECC and ARMCANZ
 (2000) sediment guidelines identified environmentally relevant concentrations of As, Cu and Ni.
 More than 75 % of the drain sediments sampled contained more As than the ISQG -Low, and the
 largest value from the drain sediments exceeded the ISQG-High. Copper and Ni concentrations in
 the drain sediments were also greater than the ISQG-Low values in more than 25 % of samples.
 
 The drain sediments were found to be a potential source of rapid acidification and element release
 in the Firewood Creek catchment. Soil pH (pHF) and oxidised soil pH (pHFOx) values indicated
 that the drain sediments rapidly acidified on oxidation, likely because of sulfide oxidation and Fe
 hydrolysis. Examination of element hosting and pHF and pHFOx data from the drain sediments
 indicated that the greatest threat with regard to element mobilisation was oxidation. This was
 because oxidation and the resultant acidification of the drain sediments would cause the release of
 elements from both the oxidisable fraction and the acid extractable fraction.
 
 Sediments from the mouth of Firewood Creek were found to have increased their concentration of
 As, Fe, Ni and Pb between July 2002 and April 2004. This period coincided with increased
 seawater inundation of the Firewood-Magazine Creek catchment. This indicated that more
 extensive seawater inundation of the Firewood Creek catchment caused an increase in the transfer
 of As, Fe, Ni and Pb from the ASS to the mouth sediments.
 
 Plant samples growing in the IAASS were collected for element bioavailability assessment. Species
 collected were the mangrove fern Acrostichum speciosum and the grass Paspalum vaginatum.
 Comparison of element concentrations in the stems from the Acrostichum speciosum samples collected
 from IAASS with the background samples showed larger median concentrations of Co, Cr and Zn.
 Median concentrations of Cu and Zn were higher in the stems Paspalum vaginatum from the IAASS
 than the background locations. This indicated that Co, Cr, Cu and Zn were potentially more
 phytoavailable in the IAASS.
 
 Comparison of element concentrations in the stems of Paspalum vaginatum with the NRC (1980)
 animal feed guidelines identified Al concentrations toxic to cattle (&gt; 1,000 ppm), horses and pigs (&gt;
 200 ppm). However, the toxic Al concentrations did not appear to be related to AASS inundation.
 The research showed that seawater inundation was rehabilitating AASS in the Firewood-Magazine
 Creek catchment on East Trinity. This was demonstrated by the near neutral soil pH values of
 IAASS. However, Fe was mobilised during AASS inundation. The mobilised Fe contributed to the
 formation of chemical sediments in the drains servicing areas of IAASS. Furthermore, inundation
 of the Firewood Creek catchment may have increased the concentration of As, Fe, Ni and Pb in
 mouth sediments of Firewood Creek.
 
 Based on the findings of the project, it is recommended that controlled seawater inundation (i.e.
 inundation to a constant elevation) of Firewood Creek be maintained and closely monitored.
 Inundating the AASS of Firewood-Magazine Creek catchment to a constant elevation will continue
 the rehabilitation of the AASS, as well as mitigate the risk of oxidation of the drain sediments.
 Plants should be monitored for element concentrations. Site management should include
 minimising wild and domestic animal exposure to toxic element concentrations from plants
 growing in the areas of AASS inundation. Finally, the mouth sediments of Firewood Creek showed
 increased concentrations of elements mobilised during seawater inundation of AASS. Monitoring
 of the sediments of Firewood Creek should be conducted to assess the changes in the element
 concentrations of the sediments during the rehabilitation.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2126/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2126/2/02Chapters1-2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2126/3/03Chapters3-5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2126/4/04Chapters6-8.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2126/5/05RefAppend.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Death rights: hearing the voices of older women in the voluntary euthanasia debate</field><field name="creator">Sceriha, Madge G.</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the opinions of older women about end of life issues with a particular focus on whether voluntary euthanasia and physician assisted suicide should be accessible as options for the terminally ill. It describes, and critically reflects upon, the opinions and experiences of 12 older women from the University of the Third Age (U3A), an organization for older people here in Townsville in North Queensland. These women had responded to a letter from me, published in the local U3A Newsletter, in which I had invited women members interested to participate in this research to contact me to arrange an interview.
 
 My interest to hear the voices of older women in this debate emerged heuristically as I reflected upon my personal experience as an older woman who had felt helpless and ignorant when confronted by my terminally ill partner&#8217;s suffering. Many questions had arisen for me about why there was no way he could have accessed assistance to die as his condition worsened. This interest grew as I read widely about voluntary euthanasia and was reinforced by the publicity surrounding a radicalised voluntary euthanasia lobby and the suicides of two older women supporters of the voluntary euthanasia movement. I pondered opposing viewpoints also, especially those which predicted older women would be among the most vulnerable to the &#8216;slippery slope&#8217; consequences which opponents believed would follow the legalising of voluntary euthanasia. I wondered if other older women were questioning as I was and how to encourage more widespread community conversations about these controversial issues. I decided to inquire further and this thesis is the outcome of that inquiry.
 
 I used a guided interview schedule based on broad areas of interest around end of life challenges which encouraged a conversational approach to the purpose in hand, and allowed other relevant ideas and issues to emerge which may not have arisen otherwise. I applied the principles of theory triangulation to the analytic process as an heuristic tool. This involved embracing feminist standpoint theory from a perspective not unlike post modern feminism, as well as utilising the principles of a broadly based critical tradition to engage with post modern thinking. In this way I was able to acknowledge the importance of subjectivity, but from a perspective in which the individual is perceived as being socially located in complex power relations and structural divisions (Hirschmann, 2004; Thompson, 2000; Young 1990). At the end of each of these chapters I have critically reflected on aspects of the socio-cultural and political context within which the participants opinions have been formed to highlight the significance of the personal-political nexus in that process. This critically reflective approach allowed me, as the researcher and as participant-partner, to add my voice to the analytic process as a feminist, an older woman, a woman with a disability and an activist in all these three areas of interest.
 
 The findings have been reported as thematic clusters under the chapter headings: Older Women Speak Out: About Death and Dying, About Voluntary Euthanasia and About Quality of Life. It appeared that, while death was not feared, the dying process was a more daunting prospect, especially if it was likely to involve a protracted period of decline and deterioration. Few of the participants had any experience with palliative care and, those who did, were disappointed that it had not lived up to their expectations. Most adamantly rejected the prospect of admission to a nursing home and, though several speculated that suicide may be their only alternative, most hoped they would be able to remain living independently in their own homes, with support if necessary, till they died.
 
 The concepts which emerged in the findings chapters as the critical reflective process unfolded, appeared to cluster with the concept of &#8216;ethics of care&#8217;. Some feminists,, including feminists within the disability movement, advocate working with ethics of care from within a political rather than a psychological framework and, as a consequence, to locate this important ethical issue within the social domain (McLaughlin, 2003; Sevenhuijsen, 1998). This perspective informs the final chapter in which I take the critically reflective process forward to vision a different future in which ethics of care understandings about the interdependencies between people are given full scope. I propose tentative strategies to implement this at grassroots, professional practice and policy development levels.
 
 These strategies for change include exploring opportunities for alliances to be negotiated between groups which have interests in common around social care provision and the protection of the rights of vulnerable people. Such alliances are particularly relevant in the light of what has been identified as a health care crisis. Locating care in the social domain challenges the privileged position of medicine as the current model of practice but not in a way which denies the importance of medicine in end of life care. Both are vital to good quality of care which, ethics of care feminists identify, is central to social functioning. This is as important at the end of life as at any other time to ensure a holistic approach to end of life management centres on the well being of the person who is dying, is sensitive to that person&#8217;s right to be heard and respects her/his wishes. This is a process which has been likened to a &#8216;midwifing&#8217; through the dying process and, making the hard choices which those who seek an easeful end request.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2127/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2127/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population biology and fishery ecology of the painted crayfish, Panulirus versicolor, on the Great Barrier Reef</field><field name="creator">Frisch, Ashley J.</field><field name="description">Panulirus versicolor, otherwise known as the painted crayfish, is a palinurid (spiny lobster) that inhabits coral reefs of the Indo-Pacific region, including Australia&#8217;s Great Barrier Reef (GBR) where it forms an esteemed component of the local recreational spearfishery. At present, management strategies for P. versicolor are based solely on precautionary principles, since prior to this study virtually nothing was known about this species. The broad goal of this thesis was therefore to describe the population biology and fishery ecology of P. versicolor on the GBR, thereby providing a framework for the development of a comprehensive management scheme for this important fishery resource.
 
 To quantify the fishery for P. versicolor, teams of spearfishers conducted 135 hr of recreational fishing activities during 12 trips spread across 15 months and seven reefs. It was found that P. versicolor was the second most abundant component of the catch, after common coral trout (Plectropomus leopardus). Catch per unit effort (CPUE) was estimated to be 0.155 &#177; 0.025 crayfish hr-1, which is equivalent to one crayfish for each 6.4 hr of spearfishing. Assuming this CPUE was representative of the recreational spearfishery as a whole, and given 37,110 hr as the total annual spearfishing effort on the GBR (Henry and Lyle 2003), the total annual catch of P. versicolor was estimated to be 5,773 &#177; 928 individuals (8,660 &#177; 1,530 kg). By world standards, this amount is relatively small. However, because this species is highly sought-after and is not abundant anywhere within its distributional range, fishing pressure on P. versicolor in readily accessible areas of the GBR may still be relatively high. Thus, a comprehensive management scheme should be implemented to ensure this species is not over-exploited.
 
 Development of a fishery management scheme requires knowledge of a range of population parameters (e.g. abundance, growth, mortality) which can be estimated by mark-recapture techniques. However, it was first necessary to develop a method of tracking individual crayfish in the wild, since most conventional tagging methods are ineffective due to moulting of the exoskeleton. As such, three unconventional tracking methods (ablation, elastomer implants, photographic identification) were evaluated in the field over periods of 6&#8211;36 months. Ablation proved to be ineffective due to a high incidence of infection and exoskeletal repair. In contrast, elastomer implants and photographic identification were shown to be highly effective (96.5% and 100% effectiveness, respectively), even after numerous episodes of moulting. Consequently, only the latter two methods were used for the remainder of the study.
 
 To investigate the population biology of P. versicolor, a multiple mark-recapture program was conducted at Northwest Island, an offshore coral cay in the GBR complex. Censuses were performed daily for ten consecutive days on six occasions between December 2003 and December 2006, thereby enabling estimation of population parameters over both short- (1&#8722;10 d) and long-term (6&#8722;36 months) periods. Fifty-six percent of crayfish (50/89) were recaptured (resighted) after 1&#8722;10 d, whereas 59% of crayfish (50/85) were recaptured after 6&#8722;36 months. Some animals were recaptured (or resighted) on multiple occasions; hence, there were 122 short-term observations and 86 long-term observations.
 
 Ovigerous female crayfish were captured in both summer and winter, suggesting that this species has a protracted spawning period. Although some females reproduced in situ, the majority of mature females appeared to emigrate temporarily during summer, resulting in a male-biased local population at that time. Using a sample of crayfish from both inshore and offshore reefs, the size at first maturity (SFM) was estimated to be 88 and 78 mm carapace length (CL) for males and females, respectively. This is substantially larger than estimates of SFM for P. versicolor from Western Australia, which may reflect regional differences in either environmental conditions or fishing pressure.
 
 Growth of P. versicolor was shown to be asymptotic and well described by a von Bertalanffy growth model (L&#8734; = 144.7 mm CL; K = 0.27 yr-1; t0 = -0.18 yr). Moult interval for larger (&gt;125 mm CL) and smaller (90&#8722;125 mm CL) individuals was estimated to be 326 &#177; 31 and 159 &#177; 18 d, respectively. Growth increment was estimated to be 2&#8722;3 mm CL and appeared to be constant across the range of sizes examined (98&#8722;153 mm CL). In general, growth of P. versicolor was similar to that of other tropical palinurids, but markedly faster than that of temperate palinurids, which supports the notion of increasing growth rate with decreasing latitude.
 
 The population of P. versicolor at Northwest Island was estimated to be small in size(1,400 &#177; 185 individuals) and sparsely distributed (1.3 &#177; 0.2 individuals ha-1). The
 estimated total mortality rate (0.28 &#177; 0.04 yr-1) was low and probably represented only natural mortality, because the study was conducted at a relatively inaccessible part of the reef that was rarely or never fished. With respect to replenishment of the population, preliminary observations suggested that individuals recruit to inshore reefs and then migrate offshore as they approach maturity &#8211; an ontogenetic pattern that is characteristic ofpalinurids in general.
 
 Adult crayfish were found to aggregate in dens during the day. At night, individuals moved to and from nearby dens, such that group composition changed frequently. Despite this, two male crayfish never occupied the same den simultaneously, indicating that groups were not merely random mixtures of individuals. Surprisingly, the relationship between bodysize (CL) and male social status (number of co-habiting females) was weak or non-existent, and experimental translocation of single male and female crayfish to occupied dens did not result in eviction, regardless of CL. Thus, body size appears to be less important in shaping the social system of P. versicolor than it is in other species.
 
 Despite the capacity to move considerable distances during short periods of time (i.e. up to 459 m d-1), at least 59% of tagged individuals (50/85) remained within a 60 ha reef area for at least 6&#8722;36 months. Also, these individuals were shown to repeatedly inhabit the same, readily identifiable dens. That P. versicolor lives in predictable places and maintains a high level of site-fidelity predisposes this species to over-exploitation, which underscores the need to implement effective management strategies.
 
 Based on the results of this study and assuming the presence of a large unfished breeding population, three important management desiderata were identified. Firstly, the current prohibition on possession of spermatophoric and ovigerous females should be revoked. This will reduce wastage of breeding females that are currently inadvertently killed by the fishery. The basis of this recommendation is that there appears to be little chance of
 localised recruitment overfishing and hence there is little need to protect breeding females at a local level. Secondly, introduction of a 100 mm CL minimum size limit would optimise yield and population biomass without greatly impacting current fishing practices. Thirdly, establishment of small marine reserves (1&#8722;2 km in dimension) is an effective strategy to counteract localised depletion of adult P. versicolor, since individuals appear not to roam widely. Implementation of these knowledge-based management strategies will help to ensure this highly desirable fishery resource is exploited on a sustainable and rational basis.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2128/3/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2128/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In at the deep end: the culture of nursing research in a paediatric ward</field><field name="creator">Smyth, Wendy</field><field name="description">This doctoral thesis reports a critical ethnographic study conducted in the Children&#8217;s Ward of a regional Australian hospital. The study explored the factors affecting the responses of nurses to the expectation that they would conduct research, and utilise research findings in their clinical practice. It identifies a multitude of facilitative and inhibiting factors affecting their responses, including conceptual, attitudinal and practical factors manifested at personal, local, institutional and broader socio-cultural levels. The critical qualitative methodology of Carspecken was used to structure the
 conceptualisation and conduct of the research, and a critical Habermasian standpoint was taken when interpreting the findings. Subsequent to an extensive literature review, data was gathered from a wide range of sources, including: non-participant observation; interviews; local documentation; policy statements and directives at ward, institutional and state level; participation in ward-based working groups and the video- and audio-recordings of those meetings. The data suggested that almost all the nurses adopted a worldview in which science is considered authoritative and has legitimacy in all aspects of life, and conceived research as a justifiable expression of this authority. An alternative discourse threaded its way through the ward, in which science was seen as having only partial relevance or legitimacy and a need for other considerations was expressed. This gave rise to a conflict which was also manifested in the nurses&#8217; self-understandings and social identities. Conflicting assumptions and demands were associated with the nurses&#8217; various professional and personal roles. Strategies that the nurses employed to manage the tensions that arose from these conflicts were identified and their influence on the likelihood of developing research-mindedness and successful participation in research were considered. Arising from this analysis, recommendations are made which offer a constructive path forward and which should enhance the future of the conduct and implementation of research in the ward and in the wider context of the hospital.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2137/2/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2137/1/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experiencing school: an exploratory, multimethod study of the perceptions of secondary teachers, advocating parents and
 mainstream students with learning difficulties</field><field name="creator">Watson, Julie</field><field name="description">Students with learning difficulties are those with, &#8216;short or long term difficulties in literacy, numeracy and learning how to learn&#8217;(Education Queensland, 1996, Introduction).They are the largest group of special needs students and consistently fail and underachieve in secondary school. Students with learning difficulties are also disproportionately represented in the juvenile justice and mental health systems, and as the long term unemployed.
 
 Despite these negative outcomes, little research has focused on this group either within Australia or internationally with the majority of research in the field concentrated in the primary school. Little comprehensive research has been undertaken with students with learning difficulties in the secondary school setting. The purpose of this exploratory, multimethod research was to address this gap. It aimed to examine the school experiences of mainstream students with learning difficulties in Queensland secondary schools by documenting the attitudes and understanding of secondary teachers together with the lived experiences of the students themselves and parents who advocated on their behalf.
 
 This research was conducted within the transformative emancipatory paradigm of disability which emphasises advocacy, involvement and improvement of the everyday
 lives of the marginalised group (Oliver, 1996). Phase One utilised a web-based survey, which collected data from 280 secondary teachers employed in government and nongovernment schools. The sample reflected the proportion of teachers engaged in each sector. The survey instrument was constructed from previously administered surveys and was evaluated by three experts in the field. A five-point Likert scale collected attitudinal data, while a separate question evaluated teacher understanding of the characteristics of students with learning difficulties based on the literature in the field. Data were subjected to Rasch analysis and Rasch scaled values for individual demographic indicators were established. Qualitative data were linked to these same Rasch scaled values for selected demographic groups.
 
 Findings indicated that the majority of teachers sampled had negative attitudes towards students with learning difficulties and no discernable differences were found
 among demographic groups. Teachers&#8217; understanding was also uniformly low across the sample with the exception of those with masters&#8217; degrees who exhibited more extensive knowledge. No correlation was established between teachers&#8217; attitudes and teachers&#8217; understanding about students with learning difficulties.
 
 Phase Two accumulated qualitative data related to school experiences using semi structured interviews of 17 participants including five teachers selected from the
 survey, six secondary students with learning difficulties and six advocating parents. Interview schedules were based on findings from Phase One and included questions related to school organisation, collaborative practices and pedagogy. Source material was analysed using NVivo and categorisation. Data were found to support the existing theory associated with students with special educational needs including those with learning difficulties.
 
 Major findings from the triangulation of interview data indicated that teachers failed to recognise mainstream students with learning difficulties and that students
 experienced inappropriate pedagogy, assessment and curricula. Informants agreed that teachers receive inadequate preservice training and professional development while existing policies exclude most mainstream students with learning difficulties from receiving assistance. Generally, teachers&#8217; aides, who assist with some students, lack adequate knowledge and skills. Lack of commitment to collaboration and community characterised teachers&#8217; views. In contrast, parents believed that schools should practise
 collaboration and community, that teachers should have relevant knowledge and that all teachers have an individual responsibility for student outcomes. Students who
 participated in the study spanned the whole spectrum from disengaged to engaged with school. All students spoke of teachers who helped them at school and who treated them
 with respect and as individuals.
 
 Consistent with the research paradigm, recommendations have been made to foreground the concerns of participating parents and students. As a researcher with a family member with learning difficulties, my voice has also been included.
 Recommendations include the encouragement of teachers, through financial incentives, to undertake higher degrees, the linking of an increased number of mandatory special
 education subjects for preservice generalist teachers with teacher registration as well as the implementation of more extensive and appropriate professional development for
 practitioners.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2129/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2129/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Absconding from a psychiatric setting in Indonesia : a case study
</field><field name="creator">Nurjannah, Intansari</field><field name="description">Patients absconding from psychiatric settings are a phenomenon that has increasingly caught the attention of nursing researchers in Western countries. This phenomenon also occurs in psychiatric hospitals in Indonesia. However, this is not a topic that has received a great deal of attention in terms of research in Indonesia. 
 
 The aim of the study is to provide a profile of absconding events over a one-year period in one psychiatric setting. The objectives of the study are to: 
 
 &#8226; identify demographic patterns associated with all patients who abscond from one psychiatric hospital during a one-year period; 
 
 &#8226; describe the experience of patients and nurses related to incidents of absconding; 
 
 &#8226; identify the contextual factors that promote and obstruct absconding behaviour; and 
 
 &#8226; discuss the ways in which absconding events in this case differ or are similar to reports of absconding in the West. 
 
 A case study using mixed methods and concurrent triangulation has been undertaken in order to provide a profile of absconding events over a period of one year in a psychiatric hospital in Indonesia. Data included a one-year audit of absconding events, a period of observation, and interviews with patients and nurses. 
 
 Over a one-year period of data collection 133 absconding events were recorded that involved 106 patients. The predominant pattern of people who abscond is that they are young male patients with a history of previous admission. 70% of patients return to the hospital on the day of absconding. On the face of it, this information is consistent with findings in the West, however qualitative data reveals significant differences. 
 
 Sixteen patients who absconded during a seven-month period of data collection were interviewed. Three themes were identified: &#8216;The call to home&#8217;, &#8216;Hopes and realities&#8217; and &#8216;Us and them&#8217;. All these themes link to the process of recovery. &#8216;The call to home&#8217; and hopes for happier life are considered as the first step in the process of recovery. &#8216;The call to home&#8217; reflected the patients&#8217; eagerness to have connection with their family and to feel safe. Patients hope to experience a happier life, however most of their hopes are dashed as they fail to reach home or their family sent them back to hospital. The last theme is &#8216;Us and them&#8217; in which the patients describe the differences between them and others, and the consequence of the differences which create negative feelings and forms a barrier to developing and growing towards recovery.
 
 Observations and interviews with 24 nurses reveal a style of nursing that is custodial rather than therapeutic. The days are filled with routine duties, and opportunities to prepare patients for discharge as an important part of the recovery process, are missed. The nursing staff is disappointed with the attitude of the family and community towards people with mental health problems and believes that families are responsible for patients once they are ready for discharge. 
 
 The majority of patients who absconded from the hospital in this study were ready for discharge and awaiting collection by their family. They were considered to be in the process of recovery, but it appears that there is little adequate support for patients who are ready to be discharged from hospital. It is not unusual for patients who have absconded to be brought back to hospital again by their family if they are not well received in the community. 
 
 Short term recommendations centre on the rehabilitation focus and activities in the hospital. Nurses should become more involved with interventions that are appropriate in rehabilitation processes and see it as an integral part of discharge planning included in management plans. In the longer term, nurses require resources to support their education and the implementation and evaluation of person-centered models of care. Strategic plans should be implemented to change public and professional attitudes towards people with a mental health problem. Further research on this topic is required to understand family and community attitudes, recovery from a range of perspectives and test alternative models of nursing care.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2132/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2132/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative growth dynamics of Acanthurid fishes
</field><field name="creator">Mutz, Stephanie J.</field><field name="description">Considerable variation exists in the demographic characteristics of coral reef fishes. Growth trajectories of size, growth and longevity of four species of the widespread coral reef family, Acanthuridae, were investigated. Growth data were obtained from growth increments in sagittal otoliths. Three species of these were studied in the tropical Atlantic, and one in the tropical South Pacific. The focus of the study is the variability of the demographic parameters at both large and small spatial scales. Large scales studies were conducted along both latitudinal and longitudinal gradients. Latitude has a direct influence on sea temperature, and this affects the growth and demography of teleosts. Longitudinal effects are not as well studied, and comparing the demographic characteristics of teleosts along a longitudinal gradient is the first of this type of study. Longitudinal comparisons of longevity and growth allow us to analyse the variability of life history characteristics of organisms at different localities across an ocean without having to consider the effects of sea temperature. In order to completely understand the mechanisms behind large scale variability in demography, a small regional scale study can aid in pinpointing possible factors that can discern these differences within a small region. A local scale study was conducted at Bermuda with study habitats 10&#8217;s of kilometres apart.
 
 Analysis of size at age data revealed that these acanthurids exhibit fast initial growth, until age 4, after which is substantially reduced generating a characteristic
 &#8220;square&#8221; growth curve. This indicates evidence that size and age of some reef fishes may be decoupled. All species at every study site follow similar growth patterns within the first four years of life. Acanthurids, including the species in this study, generally reach maximum size within the first 10% of their life span, irrespective of their maximum size and longevity. Nevertheless it must be noted that as most populations reach asymptotic size, there are exceptions for three species (A. coeruleus, A. chirurgus and A. lineatus) at two locations (Isla de Margarita and Marquesas). In these populations growth was reduced at older ages, but did not reach asymptote. Upwelling events and nutrient blooms may be responsible for these non-asymptotic growth trajectories, providing sufficient resources to allow growth to occur more prominently.
 
 The species in this study exhibit a wide range of sizes, although maximum sizes and longevities were not correlated. This study found that populations of the longest lived acanthurids do not necessarily reach the largest body sizes contradicting previous age and body size correlation studies of acanthurids, and indeed ectotherms in general.
 
 In the tropical Atlantic Ocean, the demography of Acanthurus bahianus, A. coeruleus and A. chirurgus was assessed at 12 locations on a large (56o) latitudinal scale. Mean sea temperature (MST) negatively correlated with longevity, absolute body size, and instantaneous growth (size-at-age at ages 1, 2.5 and 4) over a large latitudinal gradient. Decreasing growth with increasing temperature is a trend which is opposite to many previous demographic studies of ectotherms, and more specifically, teleosts. Populations of all Atlantic species in this study from cooler (i.e. lower MST) environments are longest lived, but not necessarily largest in size (i.e. Bermuda), while populations of all species in warmer waters consistently exhibited small size and short lifespan (i.e. Belize), indicating MST may not be the only factor driving these growth patterns. Mass island effects can also influence growth, as populations from the isolated oceanic islands have the longest lifespans and larger body sizes. 
 
 To assess the potential influences of other environmental and fishing impacts, a study was conducted along a longitudinal scale at constant sea temperature. The demography of A. lineatus was estimated at five localities spanning 75o longitude across the South Pacific Ocean. The variation in body size and instantaneous growth among sites was equivocal. A negative relationship was found between longevity and longitude from the west to east end of the Pacific Ocean, however within Oceania, the difference was not so great. This is in accordance with previous studies demonstrating exceptionally long life spans of coral reef fishes on the Great Barrier Reef.
 
 Comparisons of the demographic patterns of A. coeruleus and A. chirurgus between the lagoonal and outer reefs of Bermuda allowed me to assess any variability in the life history characteristics on a small regional scale. Juveniles of A. chirurgus settled onto the lagoonal reefs and migrated to the outer reef as adults, while both juveniles and adults of A. coeruleus inhabited the outer reef. These differences in spatial distribution on a local scale may give us a better indication of the environmental effects on the general demographic patterns found at larger spatial scales.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2133/3/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2133/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ready, set, don't go: pre-school retention practices that restrict children's access to school</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Robyn</field><field name="description">Repeating the Pre-school year has become common practice in Queensland schools. Other increasingly used practices with similar intent and outcomes include returning children to Pre-school from Year 1, Transition programs and delayed school entry. Although Pre-school retention has been a long accepted remedy for children&#8216;s underachievement and low levels of readiness for school, research from the United States warns that such practices offer few benefits for children (Hong &amp; Raudenbush, 2005; Hong &amp; Yu, 2006; Jimerson, 2001a, 2001b) and may be harmful (Jimerson, 2001a; Shepard &amp; Smith, 1989; Walberg et al., 2004). In addition, data collected from Queensland in Australia and North Carolina in the United States revealed a substantial increase in Pre-school retention rates over the last decade. 
 
 In the light of such concerns, case studies employing a constructivist approach were conducted at nine Queensland schools to examine these practices. Unstructured interviews were conducted with fifty-one teachers and parents to examine their explanations for the continued employment of Pre-school retention and other related practices. The study found that although multiple discourses were available, teachers drew on a dominant way of assessing children&#8216;s readiness for school. Children needed to be &#8216;school-ready&#8216;, that is, they were required to have particular skills and behaviours or cultural resources to successfully participate in schooling. Children who did not have the cultural resources valued at school were positioned &#8216;unready&#8216; for school, discouraged from commencing school and were repeated at Pre-school, returned to Preschool from Year 1, placed in Transition classes or their entry to school was delayed. 
 
 Boys and younger children were more often repeated at Pre-school, returned to Preschool from Year 1 or had delayed school entry. Mobile children and children with little or no pre-school experience were targeted for Transition classes. Among children targeted for Transition classes were Indigenous children and children from schools whose catchment areas were marked by families of low socio-economic status. Such groups of children have already encountered challenges in education and are among groups of children identified in social justice policies (Department of Education, Queensland, 1994; Department of Education and the Arts, Queensland, 2005a). The study found that practices underpinned by school-ready discourse contradicted social justice policies (Department of Education, Queensland, 1994; Department of Education and the Arts, Queensland, 2005a).
 
 Teachers from two of the nine schools in the study employed practices which valued all children&#8216;s cultural resources with which they commenced school, positioned all children in a positive way and as competent and &#8216;ready&#8216; learners. These practices, which were underpinned by the more recent constructivist/interactionist understandings of school readiness, incorporated a shared responsibility of families, schools and communities to prepare children for school (Australian Research Alliance for Children and Youth (ARACY), 2007). They are further supported by current research (ARACY, 2007; Pianta &amp; Cox, 1999), early childhood education departments (NAEYC, 1997) and curriculum bodies (QSA, 2007). In conclusion, the study recommends that teachers&#8216; efforts to prepare children for school be supported with continued professional development incorporating more recent conceptualisations of school readiness.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2134/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2134/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The stratigraphy and geochronology of emergent fossil reef deposits of Western Australia</field><field name="creator">O'Leary, Michael John</field><field name="description">Corals provide the most widely used sea-level archive. Many coral species survive only in shallow water, therefore fossil corals emergent or submergent relative to present reefs, along stable coastlines, suggest variations in past sea level. Along the coastal margin of Western Australia (WA) an extensive series of marine isotope stage (MIS) 5e reefs outcrop at 3 &#177; 1 m above sea level. 
 
 The consistency of reef elevation along thousands of km of WA coastline demonstrates the tectonic stability of this trailing intraplate continental margin. There is also evidence of erosional terraces or incipient reef development at elevations above this +3 m sea-level benchmark. Some workers reasoned that the  higher elevation of these marine units is an artefact of localized tectonism or warping. This rationale fails to address: 1) intertidal deposits at multiple elevations in close proximity; 2) the distinct geomorphological difference between the lower and upper marine units; and 3) the similarity in elevation between WA emergent marine deposits and those found on stable carbonate platforms of The Bahamas and Bermuda. 
 With accurate and precise dating of these emergent reef deposits it may be possible to characterise the nature of sea level during MIS 5e.
 
 Coral skeletons are constructed of chemically unstable aragonite. Older coral material is generally more diagenetically altered, often suffering the addition or loss of uranium or thorium, which leads to inaccurate U-series age calculations. Coral diagenesis is generally determined by changes in carbonate mineralogy, but a more subtle form of geochemical alteration may affect the uranium-thorium age of corals that appear mineralogically pristine.
 
 In an attempt to extract meaningful ages from corals that have undergone isotopic exchange, modeled alpha-recoil processes were used to calculate open-system ages. These open-system ages are based on the assumption that alpha-recoil mobilisation
 is the only diagenetic process operating within the coral/reef unit. Independent age controls including: 1) the known duration of MIS 5e; 2) stratigraphic superposition; and 3) age equivalence within individual corals, were used to test the reliability and accuracy of uncorrected and open-system corrected coral ages. Despite claims to the contrary, this study found open-system corrections to fail the above prescribed age tests, such that open-system corrections did not reflect the corals true age.
 
 Investigations into the nature of MIS 5e sea levels were focused on two contrasting locations, Cape Cuvier, a high-energy coastal site, and Shark Bay, a low energy marine embayment. Both sites point to an extended period of widespread coral reef development at +2 to +4 m elevation with incipient reef and erosional terraces at between +6 and +10 m. The incipient nature of the upper coralgal rim and the fact that the lower terrace was not able to utilize the newly available accommodation space points to a brief but rapid sea level excursion to this new elevation. High-precision U-series
 dating returned coral ages that were inconsistent with the stratigraphic interpretation of the site and other known MIS 5e sea level curves.
 
 In an attempt to fill in the temporal and spatial gaps left by coral dating, the Useries method was applied to crustose coralline algae (CCA). This study shows that living CCA capture a modern seawater equivalent &#61668;234U value of 147.02 &#177; 1.5 &#8240;, and initial
 uranium concentrations of 0.2 &#177; 0.07 ppm. These initial chemistries allow for the examination of uranium and thorium isotopic evolution over geological timescales, however uranium uptake and detrital 232Th contamination limit the usage of this material in U-series dating.
 
 Although we are confident of our interpretation of the sea-level history in WA during MIS 5e, we offer the following considerations: 1) field observations and relationships remain the most reliable means of determining the succession of events in the case of MIS 5e; 2) despite increased measuring precision of &#8220;high tech&#8221; dating methods, there is not necessarily a concomitant increase in the accuracy of the ages; and, 3) open-system corrections are not a reliable tool for determining a coral&#8217;s true age.

This is the view that numerous small fires, with variety in fire timing, frequency and intensity, will lead to habitat diversity across the landscape, thereby benefiting species conservation. The paradigm recognises that fire is instrumental in shaping the Australian environment, and that no single fire regime will suit all species. As a result, land holders wanting to adopt ecologically sustainable fire management practices are advised to develop and maintain fine-grained landscape patchiness using fire. However, there is no guidance on optimal fire size, level of internal fire patchiness or desirable fire frequency. Having ill-defined objectives is incompatible with &#8216;adaptive management&#8217;, the approach espoused for managing in the face of inadequate information and uncertainty. Adaptive management, or learning by doing, requires clear management objectives and careful monitoring. When, how often, and how much should manager&#8217;s burn, and how should they evaluate success? Although adaptive management accommodates uncertainty, the scale and internal patchiness of proposed fire operations need to be articulated in order to commence the cycle with a &#8216;best guess&#8217; management target. Addressing this issue and bridging the gap between ecological understanding and applied land management is the critical next step in fire ecology. This thesis focuses on this concern.
 
 The case study area was the Mount Isa Inlier, a semi-arid bioregion in northwest Queensland, Australia. The study concentrated on the fire ecology of spinifex/snappy gum woodlands, the dominant vegetation type in the bioregion. Remote sensing technology was used to examine landscape fire patterns and to identify key drivers of these patterns. Field surveys were undertaken to determine regenerative responses of the vegetation and to investigate spatial variability between and within fires. To investigate the potential effects on fauna, a fauna fire response database was compiled using expert opinion. Species were then classified according to their fire sensitivity based on species&#8217; refugium requirements during a fire and vegetation maturation stage requirements after a fire. The predicted response of fauna was tested in the field using birds as a sub-group. The results were interpreted in terms of setting objectives for adaptive management, with recommendations on a target fire size and associated monitoring. The Mount Isa Inlier was found to have greater affinity with arid Australian landscapes than mesic savannas. Fire scars mapped over a six-year period (1998-2003) showed that the total area burnt per year was related to the strength of the preceding wet season. Post-fire changes in the vegetation were highly predictable. There was a flush of annual and ephemeral species after the first rain. The abundance of these species decreased over time, while the cover of perennial species increased. There was insufficient fuel for fire to spread for at least three years from the previous fire. By then, most ephemeral species have set seed, and perennial species have started to produce seeds. Resilience to fire was enhanced by the inherent variability within burnt areas. Vegetation at early recovery stages co-existed with patches of vegetation at later recovery stages. Mature plants in unburnt patches provide reproductive material that ensures individual species remain in the system. Collectively, these data provided an understanding of firemediated vegetation dynamics in spinifex/snappy gum communities. When the fire-sensitivity of fauna species was tested, birds relying on long unburnt spinifex during and after fire were more vulnerable than generalist species.
 
 Additional field studies were undertaken to investigate the internal fire-patchiness requirements of fire-sensitive species. The ideal characteristics for unburnt patches within fire scars could not be defined. Nonetheless the approach provided sufficient insight for a target fire size to be proposed. Restricting fire size to around 100 ha was considered acceptable to conserve birds in the bioregion. It is recommended that a suite of fire-sensitive species be used for ecological monitoring, based on the objective process used in this study. Fine-scale satellite imagery (IKONOS, 1-m2 &#8211; 4-m2 pixel resolution) was investigated as a tool for quantifying fire patchiness. If fuel load or fire severity could be mapped, this would provide the initial step. Mapping fuel loads at this scale would also give accurate and spatially explicit fire histories for different areas. This would benefit researchers interested in characterising fire regimes as it would allow for successive monitoring. Field data on fuel load and fire severity were compared to reflectance values recorded by the IKONOS satellite. A fuel load map was produced, but the inherent uncertainty in remote sensing processes meant that results were generalised to areas with high, medium or low fuel load. Although this can assist managers to identify areas of high fire hazard, its day-to-day use for monitoring fire patchiness is questionable. Mapping fire severity was not successful and remains the key fire regime variable not yet captured by remote sensing. The fine-scale mapping components of this study supported the notion that restricting fire size should be emphasised as a management goal in northwest Queensland. Internal fire-patchiness was inherent and difficult to specifically plan for. Fire size can be readily monitored using existing remote sensing techniques.
 
 The major contribution of this work is that it provides a way to mesh the patchiness paradigm with practical land management. By tailoring fire size to the needs of the most fire sensitive species, the remainder are likely to be catered for, by default. Fire-sensitive species can be identified by classifying species according to their requirements during, and immediately after, fire. The method tested here proved to be useful and can be applied in different environments and at different scales. This is one of the few studies that endeavours to quantify the level of patchiness to which managers might aspire. It demonstrates a strategic approach that integrates well with adaptive management. Thus, the findings provide a way to progress from setting management goals based on ecological principles, such as &#8216;a fine scale mosaic&#8217;, to setting more specific targets based on ecological understanding and a coherent process. Further, the thesis provides important information on the fire ecology of spinifex/snappy gum woodlands in the Mount Isa Inlier. Fire-related research is scant for this area, so this information provides a starting point for ecological fire management in the region.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2153/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2153/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recruitment hotspots around a coral reef: the roles of hydrodynamics and habitats</field><field name="creator">Eagle, Janelle Vinita</field><field name="description">The patterns and causes of variation in recruitment are widely acknowledged as major determinants of the spatial structure of coral reef communities, both for corals and reef-associated fishes. Atolls and isolated platform reefs often form discrete adult populations and management units for reef organisms. 
 
 Recruitment to such reefs as a whole and spatial variation at the scale of whole reefs is, however, poorly understood. In addition, concomitant patterns in the recruitment of both corals and fishes have never been investigated. This study examined patterns of variation in coral and fish recruitment around a platform reef on the southern Great Barrier Reef (One Tree Reef) over three years. Using both descriptive and experimental approaches, it examined the roles of hydrodynamic processes and the composition of benthic assemblages as potential causes of recruitment variation across the reef. The aims were to detect persistent &#8220;recruitment hotspots&#8221; that may be vital to the replenishment and management of reef isolates, and to develop an understanding of why recruitment hotspots occur where they do.
 
 Variation in hydrodynamic regimes in the boundary layer and in the free-stream flow around One Tree Reef was investigated to determine potential differences in larval supply to different areas around the reef. Plaster dissolution was used to assess net water movement on a hierarchy of scales: among locations one to three kilometres apart, among sites within one kilometre of each other and within metres at each site. In the boundary layer, the greatest amount of variation in water movement (69 %) was found within metres at sites, thus precluding comparisons among sites or among locations. In the free-stream, the greatest amount of variation (73 %) was attributable to differences 4 among sites. Relative ranks of sites according to water movement were consistent when measured at different times, although variability in wind direction affected locations. In the free-stream, mean water movement was 1.5 to 1.8 times greater at some sites compared with others. For flow in the free-stream, variability in water movement among sites could significantly affect cumulative larval supply and subsequent recruitment to assemblages in different areas. When larvae enter the boundary layer they are, however, also likely to be influenced by patterns of flow that are probably determined by small-scale (centimetres to metres) topography.
 
 Patterns of variation in the composition of benthic coral reef assemblages around a reef were investigated to determine whether they persisted over time, and whether they were related to variation in net water movement. Benthic assemblage structure is known to influence recruitment patterns for coral and fish larvae, therefore, significant and predictable variation in the benthic composition among sites, and relationships between assemblages and water movement, could influence spatial patterns of recruitment at this scale. Two different types of sampling units were used to assess the benthic composition of coral reef assemblages: transects sampled the substratum under points spaced along 50 metres of the reef margin, while quadrats sampled the substratum under points located within a 1 m2 area. The relative compositions of benthic assemblages were variable among sites, but patterns of relative variation persisted over two to three years using both types of sampling unit. The nature of linear relationships between benthic composition and net water flow, however, differed between sampling units. In quadrats the multivariate composition of coral assemblages was significantly linearly correlated with water flow, however, in transects only the percent cover of some particular benthic categories were linearly correlated with water flow. Nevertheless, overall patterns in the benthic composition of assemblages around One Tree Reef were relatively consistent over the length of the study period, related to patterns of water flow, and together defined stable characteristics of sites likely to be important to the recruitment of reef corals and fishes.
 
 Variation in recruitment of scleractinian corals and potential associations with net water flow, adult abundance and settlement substrata were examined around One Tree Reef.
 
 Although overall recruitment rates were very low compared to other studies of recruitment on the Great Barrier Reef, particular sites, both on the reef slope and in the lagoon, had consistently higher recruitment. These &#8216;recruitment hotspots&#8217; (two or greater recruits per tile on average for two or more deployment periods) were, however, at different sites for different coral families. Variation in recruitment of pocilloporids and poritids, but not acroporids, was related to the percentage cover of adult colonies at each site. Recruitment hotspots were more common at sites with medium levels of water flow in the lagoon (4.6 cms-1), but there were no clear relationships on the slope. In contrast, in experimental aquaria, Acropora nasuta settlement was six to ten times greater under low water flow speeds (2.1 cms-1), compared to medium water flow speeds. This indicated that recruitment hotspots in the field might be more related to larval supply than to larval selection for medium flow sites. Differences in patterns of recruitment among taxa may have also been due to brooding and spawning life history strategies.
 
 Identifying congruent recruitment hotspots for reef corals and fishes and their causes, represents a potentially powerful tool for understanding reef-wide persistence and resilience, and prioritizing management areas within reefs. Spatial variation in recruitment around a reef was monitored for three species of planktivorous coral-dwelling fishes, Pomcentrus moluccensis, Chromis viridis and Dascyllus aruanus and relationships with net water flow and benthic composition were examined. As for coral taxa, for all species there were &#8216;recruitment hotspots&#8217;, where recruitment was two to three orders of magnitude (10&#8217;s to 100&#8217;s of fish per 100 m2) greater than at other sites (less than 1 fish per 100 m2). One site was a recruitment hotspot for all three species, but other sites were recruitment hotspots for just one or two species. Deterministic factors contributing to consistent patterns at this scale included positive relationships with the abundance of recruit microhabitats for P. moluccensis and C. viridis, and relationships with net water flow, though the nature of relationships with water flow differed between species, and also between the lagoon and slope environments. There was no clear relationship between recruitment and net water flow for D. aruanus, and recruitment was greatest at sites in the lagoon where the coral microhabitats to which this species recruited were intermediate in abundance. Relationships between recruiting fish and microhabitats may have been confounded by interactions between net water flow and microhabitats. Flow variation not only affected the abundances of coral taxa but also their morphology. Lower flows produced coral colonies with a wider branching morphology that were preferred by recruits. Nevertheless, recruitment hotspots for coral reef fishes were clear and could be predicted using a combination of hydrodynamic and benthic influences and their synergistic relationships.
 In summary, patterns of spatial variability in hydrodynamics and benthic composition around a reef persisted over time and were two factors that influenced recruitment patterns in reef corals and fishes. &#8216;Recruitment hotspots&#8217; were identifiable for all three coral families, and all three fish species, although these sites were not the same for all taxa, reflecting differences in their relationships with hydrodynamics and benthic composition. Interestingly, relationships between patterns of recruitment, hydrodynamics and benthic composition varied not only among taxa, but also between lagoon and slope environments for individual taxa. Sites in the lagoon and on the slope that were recruitment hotspots for more than one taxon were, however, clustered in one area on the leeward side of the reef, and may have related to patterns of larval accumulation at a larger scale. Although there is a general consensus among coral reef ecologists that recruitment is variable, this study adds to the growing body of literature suggesting that predictable and persistent recruitment hotspots occur around coral reefs.
 
 This variation should be taken into account in the selection of sites for ecological research and for reef management.

In the countries most affected by HIV/AIDS, all children are touched by the epidemic and their lives are affected in unprecedented ways. Families may experience a range of emotional reactions including fear of contagion, anticipatory grief, shame, and perceived helplessness, which can impede coping and create disruptions and relationship problems.
 
 Further challenges, such as dealing with loss, uncertainty about the future, anxiety, sadness, anger, financial worries, and interpersonal stress, and an uncertain health support system are also common. Sadly, the struggle against real or perceived discrimination within their communities and even within families often reinforces their invisibility. Most children affected by HIV/AIDS tend to have limited access to health, education and welfare services. For the most vulnerable children, those whose parents are infected with HIV, care and support needs to start before children are orphaned. Their psychological support and acceptance in a non &#8211; discriminatory environment is just as important as their material needs. When considering the needs of children affected by HIV/AIDS, it is vital to recognise the importance of a supportive environment for a child&#8217;s survival and development. Effective interventions seek to listen to children and their families. They work to strengthen the capacities of children, families and communities to respond effectively.
 
 This research is an inquiry into the effectiveness of a project that aimed to create prototype replicable models of rights-based, &#8216;Child-friendly&#8217;, schools that respond to the special needs of children in distress, develop psychosocial competencies, and promote healthy lifestyles and resilience in children and youth affected by AIDS in three districts of upper northern Thailand. Emphasis was placed on building the self- esteem and effectiveness of children, as they are crucial components for optimal growth and development. One of the aims of this research was to provide an understanding of the lives and needs of children affected by HIV/AIDS, particularly within Thai culture.
 
 It is a thesis with two parts. In part one, pilot research highlighted the psychosocial problems that occur in a familial unit affected by HIV. This research was intended to provide a holistic insight into how HIV disrupts key areas that underpin a child&#8217;s development and social acceptance. Interpersonal relationships, grieving issues, communication, disclosure rates, acceptance in schools, orphan outcomes and the effects of AIDS stigma were investigated in-depth. Results suggest AIDS affected children suffer from a large array of problems that affect their wellbeing. Stigma and the sense of hopelessness associated with HIV/AIDS have the potential to greatly undermine the provision of care to children infected/affected by HIV/AIDS. 
 
 Recommendations suggest that support for children must be an integral part of programmes reaching parents with HIV/AIDS. Focus should not only be on orphaned children, it should be on all children who are vulnerable. The implementation of more child centred programmes is also recommended, as effective child-centred interventions do not focus on children alone, but consider the social context of their communities, the relationships within their families, as well as the structures and services that are in place to provide support to children.
 
 Effective child-centred approaches are underpinned by a set of principles that view the child as a whole person, rather than as a set of separately defined needs.
 The second part of the thesis presents a child centred intervention, the &#8216;Child Friendly Schools&#8217; project (CFS) that aimed to alleviate the psychological problems experienced by AIDS affected children. An evaluative assessment was undertaken on this project utilising a combination of both qualitative and quantitative techniques. Focus group discussions and art therapy sessions provided first hand, qualitative feedback. The case studies of three HIV affected children containing the stories of the families and communities are presented to further highlight the complexities experienced, and to provide personal feedback on the project.
 
 Pre and post-test screens for depression and self-esteem provided an important situational analysis and a useful quantitative measure for determining if the project was effective in lowering depression and enhancing self-esteem. The results of the screening suggest a very noticeable improvement in the depression and self esteem levels of the children after a one-year period of project implementation. Overall results from both qualitative and psychological testing suggest that the CFS intervention had played a major role in improving the psychosocial wellbeing of AIDS affected children and those in difficult circumstances.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2142/3/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2142/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceptions, constraints and labour relations: health delivery services to birthing women in rural and remote areas of North Queensland</field><field name="creator">Croker, Felicity A.</field><field name="description">Although childbirth is a defining life event for most women, those in rural and remote areas of Queensland often lack choice and control over this significant experience. Childbirth is embedded in a myriad of complex and competing social, political and cultural discourses which affect both maternity practices and the quality of a woman&#8217;s birthing experience. As the result of current health policies, centralised maternity facilities and the difficulty in recruiting suitable health professionals for rural practice, birth normally takes place in a large regional centre, under obstetric supervision. Relocation for birth separates women from family and support networks. Medical intervention in the birth process is common and cultural needs are difficult to accommodate. Despite the numerous Australian reviews of birthing, gaps in the literature indicate that there is a need for qualitative, sociological research that evaluates women&#8217;s satisfaction with maternity care in rural and remote areas. 
 
 Thus, the purpose of this study was to explore the experiences and perceptions of childbearing women and maternity care providers in four selected rural and remote areas of North Queensland. The aim was to document these women&#8217;s birthing choices and expectations as well as their assessments of the experience and the services provided. Their views are compared with those of the maternity care providers. 
 
 Recognising that the quality of women&#8217;s birthing experiences is influenced by complex interpersonal, structural and ideological issues, this study synthesises postmodern insights with the political and moral imperatives of feminist emancipatory research. The theoretical approach reflects the cultural turn in sociology by being grounded in material reality while recognising the interplay between discursive social constructions and the complex specificity of real lives. 
 
 Contemporary feminist ethnography provided appropriate interpretive research techniques for this exploration of the sensitive topics of birth and the associated relationships between women and maternity care providers. Insights were gained through field notes, community profiles, participant observation and in-depth interviews with 48 participants, enabling identification of patterns of experiences and interpersonal dynamics. 
 
 The findings provide insights into the multiple macro and micro level influences on birthing experiences. Interwoven throughout the accounts are discourses around choice, risk and trust. Although participants&#8217; views on birthing covered a spectrum, the major themes which emerged were related to birthing options, quality of care, social and emotional support needs, socio-cultural background, and previous experiences. As well, as insights into effective models of maternity care for rural and remote settings were identified. There was a tendency toward high satisfaction among women who birthed locally in the high support, low technology rural/remote setting. This was also reflected in many of the maternity care providers&#8217; accounts. Interactions between birthing women and maternity care providers and amongst the health professionals impacted significantly upon the quality of care and subsequent satisfaction across the birth experience. Of concern in the findings were the endemic interpersonal conflicts within families and workplaces, which can be related to gender relations and the culture of violence in wider social structures. This, along with the need to recruit and retain health professionals sensitive to the diverse needs of childbearing women and competent in advising and supporting them, was identified as a major challenge for the maternity services. 
 
 This study identifies factors which enable or constrain the effective delivery of rural/remote maternity services and the subsequent satisfaction of childbearing women with giving birth. It makes several unique contributions. First, it identifies the impact that interpersonal interactions have upon the satisfaction of birthing women, and the retention of rural/remote health professionals. Second, developing relational genograms creates a dynamic model of social organisation that has predictive possibilities, enabling identification of problems and intervention. Third, the evident success of a rural model of maternity care provides sound support for advocates of rural birthing. Fourth, it proposes practical ways to address the identified insider-outsider phenomenon and to enhance trusting, concordant relations. Finally, the qualitative data has provided detailed understandings of the strengths and limitations of maternity services not evident in official reports.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2149/4/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2149/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of a dominant masculinity discourse in the decisions of early school leaving boys in Queensland
</field><field name="creator">Harrington, Ingrid</field><field name="description">The research was motivated by concerns about the consistent pattern of poor retention of some boys to Year 12, and overall poor performance of some boys in Australian schools.
 
 The study broadly drew on critical discourse theory to examine the circumstances surrounding the decision to leave school by 22 boys from three different social locations
 i.e. provincial, rural and metropolitan, in Queensland, Australia. Adopting Fairclough's (2002) model of discourse as a conceptual framework for this research allowed the
 exploration of the different socio-cultural practices as perceived by the boys in their broader social context.
 
 For the purpose of the research, a dominant masculinity discourse was understood by using concepts commonly associated with masculinity, namely an individual sense of
 power and control, independence, and a sense of &#8216;self&#8217;. The boys constructed narratives to explain their personal circumstances and what influenced their school leaving
 decision. Their explanations were identified as seven generative themes (Freire, 1972), and the themes could be analysed through the lens of the three concepts of a dominant masculinity discourse. Analysis of the boys&#8217; narratives through these concepts created the opportunity to link a dominant masculinity discourse with their attempts to justify their school experiences and early school leaving decision.
 
 Despite the similarity of the boys&#8217; school experiences, there were differences in the range of storylines (Bruner, 1990) identified in their narratives to illustrate their
 experiences in their broader social context differed. Similarities in the boys&#8217; narratives included their belief in the value of learning, and that the context of school was unable to provide them with learning that was both meaningful and relevant to their post school pathways.
 
 The study concluded that consideration be given by education researchers to the construction of a dominant masculinity discourse in broader social contexts, when
 understanding boys&#8217; overall performance, engagement and retention at school.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2154/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2154/3/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The causes and evolutionary consequences of behavioural, morphological and molecular genetic variation in the Chowchilla, Orthonyx spaldingii
</field><field name="creator">Koetz, Anna Helene</field><field name="description">Intra-specific variation provides the basis on which evolutionary processes such as genetic drift, natural and sexual selection can act, creating distinct patterns of divergence within and among populations. Intra-specific variation and population divergence form the very beginning of the speciation process, and so determining the relative influence of different evolutionary processes in influencing current patterns of divergence is crucial in clarifying the mechanisms of the speciation process. Although most research focuses on patterns of genetic and morphological divergence, populations may also show divergence in cultural (learnt) behaviours such as song. Divergence in song is particularly intriguing, because it is crucially important in species and mate recognition as well as in sexual selection. In true songbirds (Oscines), songs are acquired from conspecifics though learning and imitation, defining bird song as a cultural trait that is non-genetically transmitted. Because song is learned culturally, inaccurate copying of the tutor song is possible and some level of spatial variation in song is inevitable. This, in turn, can lead to cultural evolution. Cultural and genetic evolution have many parallels and similarities, including the processes of mutation, drift, natural and sexual selection and cultural flow. Geographic variation in song could potentially influence population genetic divergence leading to speciation, by favouring within-dialect mating and natal philopatry, and discouraging between-dialect dispersal. Nevertheless, the notion that divergence in a cultural trait may promote speciation is still highly controversial.
 
 Thus, the goals of this project were to determine the relative importance of different evolutionary forces in promoting geographic variation in song of the Chowchilla, Orthonyx spaldingii (Corvoidea), and to clarify the function and possible evolutionary consequences of such variation. In order to distinguish between the influence of different evolutionary forces, an integrative approach was used that combined patterns of genetic, and morphological variation with patterns of song variation. Therefore, the aims of my PhD were to (1) quantify the extent and pattern of large-scale geographic variation in song, morphology and neutral molecular genetic markers across the Chowchilla&#8217;s entire range; (2) determine the evolutionary, cultural and social processes influencing both large and smallscale variation in song in order to clarify the functional significance of song variation; and (3) determine whether birds discriminate between local, distant and foreign song dialects to further establish the possible functions as well as evolutionary consequences (i.e. reduced gene flow or reproductive isolation) of geographic variation in song.
 
 The Chowchilla is a rainforest specialist bird endemic to the montane tropical rainforests (the &#8220;Wet Tropics&#8221;) of north-eastern Australia. The Chowchilla is remarkable for its striking, yet previously unstudied large-scale geographic variation in song, which is sung by both males and females alike in territorial encounters. The Wet Tropics rainforests of Northern Australia experienced range contractions and expansions during the Pleistocene climatic fluctuations. As a consequence, many wet tropics endemic taxa are genetically divergent across an old climatic barrier, the Black Mountain Corridor (BMC), which has intermittently separated the northern and southern Wet Tropics. Limited evidence of morphological and molecular genetic divergence across the BMC also exists for the Chowchilla. Evidence of diversification in several character traits (molecular genetic, morphology and song) combined with the well established pattern of habitat expansion and contraction in the wet tropics, means that the Chowchilla provides an ideal and unique model system for comparing the evolutionary forces driving song variation with those thought to influence genetic and morphological divergence.
 
 I recorded Chowchilla songs from 15 locations across the species&#8217; range, covering five historically isolated populations (Pleistocene refugia) and two areas of post-Pleistocene recolonisation. I measured six spectral characteristics of 773 songs and used a multivariate approach to test for large-scale song divergence within and among refugia, as well as across the BMC. Songs were also divided into their syllables, and a syllable catalogue was created for the whole population. Pair-wise comparisons of syllable sharing were then used to analyse song similarity at smaller spatial scales. I also collected blood samples and morphological measurements from 54 Chowchillas captured across their range. Morphological measurements were analysed using a Principal Components Analysis to determine the extent of morphological divergence among populations from different refugia, across the BMC, as well as between the sexes. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequences from captured birds and museum specimens were analysed to determine the population genetic structure. Finally, I conducted playback experiments to determine whether Chowchillas differentiate between song variants from increasingly distant and isolated populations.
 
 I found that historically isolated populations could be clearly distinguished by their spectrotemporal song characteristics, particularly bandwidth and peak frequency. I also found striking song divergence across the BMC. Northern refugia showed significantly narrower bandwidths and higher peak frequencies than southern refugia. Song characteristics were not influenced by geographic distance, habitat type or body size. Thus, given the known history of population isolation, song characteristics were most likely influenced by vicariant isolation in refugia followed by cultural drift. Chowchillas also showed exceptional small-scale variation in song syllable characteristics. Within historic refugia, song similarity was significantly correlated with distance. It was highest amongst neighbours and decreased sharply at one kilometre. These results are consistent with the idea of post-dispersal song learning, and reveal a strongly territorial function of song dialects.
 
 Patterns of molecular genetic and morphological differentiation mirrored the pattern of large-scale song divergence across the Chowchilla&#8217;s range. This suggests that historical isolation during Pleistocene glaciation divided the Chowchilla into two distinct molecular lineages (northern and southern) that also have clearly divergent morphology and song characteristics. These findings demonstrate that vicariant isolation and genetic drift are sufficient to produce molecular genetic and phenotypic divergence in a rainforest specialist taxa. I also found significant and consistent sexual dimorphism in size and plumage colour in both northern and southern lineages, despite major size differences between lineages. This suggests that sexual selection as well as genetic drift have been important in shaping current patterns of morphological variation in both lineages. I also found no equivalent variation in bill morphology across the species entire range, suggesting that natural, stabilising selection associated with a specialized feeding niche may maintain bill characteristics in this species, independent of other morphological change.
 
 Finally, playback experiments showed that Chowchillas recognised and approached their species specific song in most playback trials irrespective of its origin. However, Chowchillas discriminated between local and foreign songs. Within lineages, groups sang significantly sooner and more often when hearing a local dialect vs. more distant song dialects. These results also support the territorial function of small-scale song variation. However, song of the alternative lineage elicited an unexpectedly high number of territorial responses. As it is highly likely that this territorial song also serves as a mate choice and advertisement function, recognition of foreign Chowchilla song means that song is unlikely to serve as a pre-mating barrier to gene flow in this species.
 
 In conclusion, these results clearly show that all three evolutionary processes &#8211; genetic drift, natural and sexual selection &#8211; have concurrently influenced Chowchilla populations, creating contemporary patterns of divergence and variation in song, molecular genetic and morphological character traits,particularly across an old climatic barrier pre-dating the Pleistocene. Nevertheless, despite clear divergence in these traits, northern and southern populations have not diverged sufficiently to create a behavioural, pre-mating barrier to gene flow.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/3218/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/3218/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of blended waste rock material at Zinifex Century Mine: consequences for acid drainage generation</field><field name="creator">McIlwaine, Laura Maree</field><field name="description">There is little doubt that acid rock drainage (ARD) is the largest and most testing long-term environmental issue facing the global minerals industry (Lawrence and Day, 1997, Munchenberg, 1998, Olson et al. 2006). The aim of this study was to assess leachate quality from different blends of waste rock at Zinifex Century Mine and determine consequences for acid drainage generation. This thesis describes the results of research undertaken to predict the risk of ARD associated with a possible change to waste rock disposal practices at the Zinifex Century Mine.
 
 Zinifex Century Mine Limited (ZCML) comprises a zinc, lead and silver mining and milling operation at Lawn Hill in northwest Queensland, concentrate dewatering and shipping facilities at Karumba in the Gulf of Carpentaria, and a 304km slurry pipeline connecting the two operations. Similar to other mines where sulphide minerals are present, ARD may be generated at the ZCML mine site from exposed pit surfaces, ore stockpiles, removed waste rock and deposited tailings (Bates et al. 2000). To minimise the generation of ARD in the waste rock dumps, waste rock is classified into the following three classes based on competence and acid forming / consuming capabilities:
 &#8226; Class 1: Competent rock, non-acid forming or acid-consuming material.
 &#8226; Class 2: Non-competent, non-acid forming or acid-consuming material
 &#8226; Class 3: Acid-forming material.
 The generalised waste rock dump design for current operations comprises an outer zone of class 1 material and inner zone containing class 2 and 3 materials. Cambrian Limestone (CLS), a class 1 material, is used for its structural and acid neutralising capabilities in waste rock dump construction.
 
 Current mine waste rock placement procedures specify that class 1 rock with greater than 5% contamination of class 3 material is to be placed within the inner zone of the waste rock dumps due to uncertainty surrounding the long-term acid producing capabilities of this rock. This procedure, as well as additional restrictions on waste rock dump design, has the potential to cause significant scheduling problems due to the limited reserve of class 1 rock available for waste rock dump rehabilitation. This is particularly the case in the latter stages of the mine life following movement of most of the waste rock to access the ore.
 
 Due to finite reserves of CLS material and the need to develop strategies to maximise the beneficial use of available limestone reserves, as well as the belief by mine personnel that the abovementioned contamination percentage may be conservative, this project was commissioned to enable the leachate from different blends of waste rock to be assessed. The objectives of the study were to:
 &#8226; Quantify blending levels of acid consuming (Cambrian Limestone) and acid forming (Hanging Wall Siltstone (HWD)) rock that will produce pH neutral leachate low in metal and salt concentrations;
 &#8226; Determine the validity of current waste rock placement procedures;
 &#8226; Investigate the influence of particle size on leachate quality; and
 &#8226; Attempt to establish links between results from various ARD prediction tests.
 
 Various static (acid base accounting, net acid generation tests, acid buffering characteristic curves and cyclic voltammetry) and kinetic (column leach tests (CLTs) and heap leach pads (HLPs)) ARD prediction tests were conducted on blended waste rock material from ZCML. Twenty CLTs, representing five lithology blends and three particle size distributions were assembled in a laboratory environment. Five replicate CLTs were established. Three HLPs representing three lithology blends were constructed from run of mine material at ZCML. The CLTs and HLPs were periodically watered to simulate rainfall events. In addition, the HLPs were exposed to wet season rainfall events. Results from the static and kinetic tests were compared to address the issue of scale-up.
 
 Findings from the study were:
 &#8226; Static tests conducted on blended CLS and HWD samples classified each sample as non acid forming (NAF). Results from kinetic testwork confirmed this finding, indicating that limestone blending may be effective in controlling the pH of leachate generated from waste rock, however elevated sulphate concentrations in leachate would ensue.
 &#8226; Results obtained from the column leach tests were repeatable.
 &#8226; Sulfate production rates were equivalent to neutralising potential depletion rates in most CLTs and HLPs. This confirmed neutralisation of the sulfuric acid produced by pyrite oxidation by calcium and magnesium carbonates.
 &#8226; The calculated time to NP depletion exceeded the time to sulfide depletion in all CLTs and HLPs, however these times were misleading for columns containing armoured CLS material.
 &#8226; Despite first flush events, total metal concentrations in CLT and HLP leachate generally complied with maximum limits specified in Environmental Authority No. MIM800020402 (Ecoaccess, 2004).
 &#8226; Dissolved zinc concentrations were significantly greater in CLT samples with low pH values, however were not as high as thermodynamically predicted using the geochemical modelling program MINTEQA2. Dissolved zinc concentrations in HLP leachate were also not as high as thermodynamically predicted at pH values less than 7.8. This was due to the control of dissolved zinc concentrations by the rate of sphalerite oxidation at low pH values and the solubility of Zn(OH)2 at high pH values.
 &#8226; Dissolved lead concentrations in CLT and HLP samples were extremely small or undetectable (i.e. less than 4.8x10-4&#956;mol L-1) and less than those thermodynamically predicted using MINTEQA2 due to low oxidation rates of galena resulting from surface passivation at lower pH values, and Pb(OH)2 solubility controlling Pb2+ concentrations at neutral-alkaline pH values.
 &#8226; Median dissolved zinc and copper production rates were comparable between the CLTs and HLPs, however rates were greater in the HLPs during large wet season flushes.
 &#8226; Geochemical modelling confirmed the absence of gypsum precipitation in the CLT comprising the most reactive waste rock blend and smallest particle size distribution and confirmed gypsum precipitation in HLP2 and HLP3. Sulfate production, neutralising potential depletion and oxygen consumption rates were therefore underestimated in these HLPs.
 The main conclusions of the study were:
 (1) Results from CLTs comprising smaller particle size distributions were most comparable with results from the HLPs. Anomalous behaviour was observed in CLTs comprising larger particle size distributions.
 (2) There was no apparent benefit in leaving the HLPs unwatered for periods of time greater than one week.
 (3) Oxygen consumption rates for CLT samples were significantly slower and consequently not directly comparable to those for the HLPs, despite greater flushing of the CLTs.
 (4) Blending CLS and HWD material was effective in maintaining neutral pH values and regulatorycompliant total metal concentrations in drainage from CLTs and HLPs comprising blends up to 75%CLS / 25%HWD. However, sulfate concentrations in drainage from all blended samples exceeded current regulatory discharge limits.
 (5) Visual inspection of material comprising the HLPs after excavation highlighted the presence of armouring layers on HWD material.
 (6) The effectiveness of CLS in neutralising sulfuric acid increased with decreasing particle size.
 Corresponding recommendations were:
 (1) Construct CLTs from particle size distributions passing 10mm as a maximum to best emulate the particle size distributions and residence times in waste rock dumps.
 (2) For future HLP testwork at ZCML, or sites of similar climatic conditions, accelerate the rate of pyrite oxidation in the HLPs by watering at weekly intervals on a continual basis in the dry season (i.e. no prolonged drought period).
 (3) For future CLT testwork for sites with distinct seasonal variations, locate the CLTs in field conditions on the site under investigation, to ensure samples are exposed to similar ambient temperatures and humidity. Alternatively, where this is not possible, site temperature and humidity conditions should be simulated in a laboratory environment.
 (4) To prevent a potential increase in sulfate concentrations in WRD discharge, the current 5% contamination limit of class 3 in class 1 material should not be reduced.
 (5) Where there is insufficient CLS material available to cover both the dump surface and batters, priority should be given to the WRD surface, with other non-acid forming competent material used on the batters.
 (6) Investigate the reduction in particle size of class 1 material placed within / on the WRDs.

</field><field name="creator">Guenther, Jana</field><field name="description">Qualitative evidence suggests that sea stars have remarkably clean epidermal surfaces. To quantify surface-associated micro- and macroorganisms, field surveys were conducted in northern Queensland, Australia, during the wet and dry seasons. Mean bacterial abundances on 7 sea star species were approximately 104 to 105 cells cm-2 during both seasons. There were no consistent trends in bacterial abundances with season, species and aboral positions on sea star arms. Low numbers of parasitic and commensal macroorganisms were found on 6 sea star species, and no common generalist macrofouling organisms, such as algae, barnacles, serpulid polychaetes, bryozoans and ascidians, were discovered on any specimens. Sea stars therefore offered an excellent model to investigate the mechanisms driving fouling-resistant surfaces. Subsequently, 5 sea star species belonging to the order Valvatida were chosen for this study to investigate mechanical, physical and chemical fouling deterrence: Acanthaster planci (Family Acanthasteridae), Linckia laevigata and Fromia indica (both Family Ophidiasteridae), Cryptasterina pentagona (Family Asterinidae) and Archaster typicus (Family Archasteridae). 
 
 It has been proposed that mechanical antifouling defence mechanisms of sea stars are linked with pedicellariae, which are pincer-like appendages made of calcareous ossicles. In this study, the role of pedicellariae of the sea star A. planci in fouling control was investigated. The morphology and distribution of its pedicellariae were measured to determine if larvae or propagules of fouling organisms could settle between pedicellariae without being in their physical range. The elementary and straight pedicellariae of A. planci had a mean length of 0.7 mm and a mean distance of 2.6 mm. The total number of pedicellariae was proportional to the estimated surface area of A. planci. To determine how pedicellariae respond to tactile stimulation, pedicellariae were stimulated by touching either inner, outer or basal sites of pedicellariae with a hypodermic needle. Pedicellariae closed rapidly on touch and closed for significantly longer when touched at their inner sites (8.9 s) than outer (6.7 s) and basal (7.9 s) sites. Settling larvae were simulated by dropping silica beads (size: 50.2 &#956;m, 181.5 &#956;m, 255.7 &#956;m and 510.7 &#956;m, density: 2.5 g ml-1) and zirconium/silica beads (size: 191.2 &#956;m and 507.6 &#956;m, density: 3.7 g ml-1) over the pedicellariae. The percentage of responding pedicellariae increased proportionally with increasing size of the silica beads. However, the percentage also increased when zirconium/silica beads of similar size but higher density were used, demonstrating that the mass, not size, of the beads was the main driving factor for the closure of pedicellariae. Pedicellariae were also stimulated by placing larvae of the bryozoan Bugula neritina (250 &#956;m)</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/3223/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/3223/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The dynamics of water on the skin of Australian carphodactyline and diplodactyline geckos
</field><field name="creator">Vucko, Matthew John</field><field name="description">Detailed examination and description of structures in nature, relative to the environments in which they occur, provides evidence for the function of these structures. Here I describe the oberhautchen (outer skin surface) of 24 species of Australian carphodactyline (Squamata: Carphodactylidae) and diplodactyline gecko (Squamata: Diplodactylidae). Using methods specially adapted for the purpose, I describe details of skin microornamentations, examined at high magnification, of these geckos, and examine relationships between these skin characteristics and environmental conditions, substrate use, hydrophobic properties, and evaporative water loss (EWL), with a view to determining the function of these features.
 
 I used 24 species (and populations therein) of geckos collected from northern and western Queensland, and from the Great Victoria Desert, South Australia, as subjects for my descriptions. To examine the oberhautchen of living lizards, I adapted and tested a method for creating extremely detailed moulds of surfaces using polyvinylsiloxane impression material and epoxy resin (Epirez 123&#174;, ITW Polymers &amp; Fluids). This method produces exceptional quality reproductions of complex microornamentations within the oberhautchen of living lizards.
 
 Using scanning electron microscopy on the moulds I created, I examined scale characteristics (primary scale size, secondary scale size, spinule length and density, pit diameter and density, furrow width and depth, percentage of knobs covering scales, and hair sensor characteristics including hair sensors per scale, hair sensors per square millimeter, bristles per sensor, bristles per square millimeter, and hair sensor diameter), I related these to body size, substrate use, environmental conditions at the centre of each species&#8217; geographic range, and phylogeny, using univariate statistics and canonical discriminant function analysis. Carphodactyline geckos are quite different from diplodactyline geckos, and have larger body size, larger primary scales, shorter spinules, greater numbers of hair sensors and bristles per square millimeter, knobs and larger hair sensor diameters. Examining both carphodactyline and diplodactylines together, I found that terrestrial geckos tend to be smaller, live in xeric conditions, and usually have smaller scales and higher numbers of bristles and hair sensors per square millimeter. Nonterrestrial geckos tend to be larger, and live in more mesic and hydric conditions, and usually have larger scales and fewer hair sensors and bristles per square millimeter. Because geckos in xeric habitats live in dry conditions, they may need more sensory  information about their environment, to enable them to select appropriate shelter. I traced the character evolution of hair sensor bristle shape, and found that bottlebrush-shaped hair sensors with many hairs appear to be primitive, whereas tapered hair sensors of various shapes with fewer hairs appear to be derived. The causes of evolutionary differences in bristle shape and hair sensor number was not clear from the variables I examined.
 
 Hydrophobicity is thought to enhance the adhesiveness of geckos with adhesive toe pads, by keeping these surfaces clean. Because specialized adhesive foot scales are evolutionarily derived from the body scales, I examined the hydrophobic properties of body scales. To estimate hydrophobicity, I used a sessile drop technique to quantify contact angles of droplets of distilled water. Tiny (0.25 &#956;L) droplets of distilled water were incrementally increased in size and photographed at high resolution, and contact angles of droplets were used to predict the hydrophobic properties of the dorsal skin surface of geckos. I established which species were most hydrophobic and which dorsal scale characteristics had the strongest relationships with hydrophobic properties. Several species had superhydrophobic skin (advancing contact angles greater than 150&#176;), including Lucasium damaeum, Strophurus taeniatus, Diplodactylus conspicillatus (Winton population), Oedura rhombifer, and Lucasium steindachneri. Geckos with high hydrophobicity were characterized by skin characteristics that promoted rough surface adaptation, especially small primary scales and long spinules.
 
 The great range of variation in gecko oberhautchen is likely to have some functional significance. However, most functions suggested in the literature (ecdysis, coping with varying temperatures on different parts of the body, pheromone capture, retention, and dispersal, the creation or reduction of friction, the reflection or channeling of solar radiation, wear prevention) can be rejected as explanations for variation in the oberhautchen of Australian gecko skin. I provide evidence that high hydrophobic properties of the skin help geckos remain clean. Hydrophobicity was, on average, higher in terrestrial species and in species living closer to the ground (and hence, likely to come into contact with dust and dirt), than in non-terrestrial species living away from the ground. Terrestrial geckos, as a group, had longer spinules and smaller scales than saxicolous and arboreal geckos, enhancing their hydrophobic properties. With the effects of phylogeny removed hydrophobicity was related to distance from the ground, indicating that these two characters evolve together. 
 
 Recent studies have linked evaporative water loss rates with scale characteristics of reptiles. I measured the EWL of Australian geckos gravimetrically, using the flow-through chamber technique, to examine patterns in water loss rates of Australian geckos in relation to scale characteristics, body size and habitat. Evaporative water loss was strongly correlated with body size, larger geckos had larger body surface area and lost more water than smaller geckos. Mass-specific water loss rates were correlated with habitat use; terrestrial species lost more water than arboreal and saxicolous species, which did not differ in their water loss. In addition, species with larger scales tended to have lower water loss rates, and the evolution of deeper scale furrows was correlated with the evolution of higher EWL.
 
 In summary, my work provides evidence that, not only are variations in Australian gecko skin morphology influenced by phylogenetic relationships, but at least some characters appear to have functional significance. Xeric-dwelling, terrestrial geckos have more sensory organs than do non-terrestrial mesic and hydric-dwelling geckos, likely because they require accurate information on environmental conditions. Terrestrial geckos tended to have smaller scales and longer spinules than non-terrestrial geckos, possibly to enhance their hydrophobicity. Terrestrial geckos also had higher EWL rates than saxicolous and arboreal geckos, but may be able to avoid high water loss by using burrows as shelter. Finally, terrestrial and xeric dwelling species tended to be smaller than non-terrestrial mesic and hydric dwelling species.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/3249/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/3249/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Variable susceptibility to an emerging infectious disease,
 chytridiomycosis, in anurans
</field><field name="creator">Kenyon, Nicole</field><field name="description">Chytridiomycosis is an emerging infectious amphibian disease, caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), and has caused numerous amphibian declines around the globe. Chytridiomycosis can be lethal in many amphibian species but not in others, leading to three different responses to exposure, 1) the amphibian becomes infected with Bd and dies, 2) the amphibian becomes infected with Bd and survives and 3) the amphibian does not become infected even though it occurs in a habitat where Bd exists. My project aimed to increase our understanding of the causes of these interspecific differences. I investigated the hypotheses that they could be caused by innate immune defences (antimicrobial peptides) against Bd, innate or adaptive responses of individuals through microenvironment selection, or behavioural avoidance of infective water.
 
 I found evidence for all three mechanisms. In vitro, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) of Litoria genimaculata (vulnerable to infection with Bd with highland population declines followed by recovery) and L. rheocola (vulnerable to infection with Bd with severe declines at higher elevations with little or slow recolonisation) can completely inhibit Bd growth. I also found large seasonal variation in antimicrobial peptide defences in both species. This may result from physiological shifts driven by temperature, or may reflect adaptation to seasonal fluctuations in the risk of infection. The proportion of L. genimaculata from high elevation populations, which have experienced strong viability selection pressure imposed by chytridiomycosis outbreaks, that produced AMPs that effectively inhibited Bd in vitro, was significantly higher than in low elevation populations, which have been protected from chytridiomycosis by environmental factors. There was also evidence that high elevation populations produced AMPs that differed slightly in chemical composition from those produced by low elevation populations. However, when individuals of either frog species produced AMPs that inhibited the growth of Bd, the effectiveness of AMPs from high and low elevation populations did not differ significantly. This suggests that any responses to selection may have occurred through an increase in the proportion of individuals producing effective AMPs, with no change in the types of AMPs produced. Antimicrobial peptide defences did not differ significantly between high and low elevation population of L. rheocola, suggesting that this species may have recolonised upland areas. On the other hand, L. rheocola had more effective antimicrobial peptide defences against Bd than L. genimaculata and may have experienced stronger selection pressure after the appearance of chytridiomycosis.
 
 Thermal microenvironments selected in the laboratory corresponded to those expected from decline patterns observed in the wild. Litoria caerulea (vulnerable to infection with Bd but no population declines due to chytridiomycosis have been detected) selected warm and hot environments significantly more often than L. genimaculata. Additionally, although not significant, there was a trend that intensity of Bd infection in all three species was more likely to decrease over time in individuals that had a choice of hydric and thermal microenvironments than in frogs that were housed under standard environmental conditions. There was also evidence of disease avoidance behaviour; some L. caerulea and L. genimaculata chose uncontaminated water significantly more often than water that contained Bd zoospores. None of the frog species were able to completely avoid water containing Bd zoospores, possibly in part because their pond selection was also influenced by side fidelity.
 
 My study demonstrates the complexity of host-pathogen interactions and that multiple factors, including innate immune defence, microenvironment selection and disease avoidance behaviour, can influence the progress of chytridiomycosis and should be considered when establishing species specific management plans.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/3253/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/3253/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">One day my prince will come: the discursive production the desire for (hetero)sexual marriage</field><field name="creator">Rocco, Sharn</field><field name="description">During the twentieth century, marriage, as an ideal and as a practice, has endured through vastly different social conditions and codes of sexual conduct. The concern of the author's investigation and analysis is how the discourses of daily life sustain the popularity of marriage as an institution that embeds the gendered 'truths' of science, God and common sense in law (of church and state), and in personal practice. She argues that it is within discourses and storylines, as these are brought to life by the imagination and practice of speaking subjects, that collective experience and its subjective and political effects are produced.
 
 Working from feminist and poststructuralist perspectives, this thesis investigates the complex discursive dynamic of gender difference and the constitution of subjectivity and desire over time. It does this by "making visible" the discursive interpellation of the subject into the romantic storylines of 'one day my prince will come'. The result is a study of the production of gendered subjectivity as "normal" and "natural" and of how, within the interactively discursive contexts of lived experience, conceptions of "normality" become inclusive of the expectation and desire for (hetero)sexual marriage.
 
 The evidence which informs this thesis is drawn from the lives of seventy-three women who contributed to a major research project using the methodology of collective memory work. This project involved participants in writing stories, and talking about incidents from their lived experience which they considered illustrated their subjection within the romantic storyline of 'One day my prince will come'. Biographical and autobiographical in style and intent, this deconstructive work produces a reframing of taken-for-granted understandings of the individual, of gender, of choice and of relations of power.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/3254/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/3254/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social enterprise: the effectiveness of the stakeholder model in a rural tourism context</field><field name="creator">Jefferies, Mervyn</field><field name="description">The purpose of the study is to provide information that will assist the tourism industry in the Vancouver Island region and in particular stakeholders and members of Destination Marketing Organizations (DMOs) to make better decisions about their marketing activities in an urban and/or rural context.

Experiments in
 which larvae were marked via tetracycline immersion of embryos have shown larval dispersal to be more limited than previously thought. However, this technique is limited to fishes that lay eggs on artificial substrata. More recently, a new chemical marking technique has been developed which can be applied to all reef fishes. Females are injected with enriched stable isotopes, such as 137Ba, and the chemical signature is maternally transmitted to embryos and is deposited at the core of the otoliths of larvae. While this technique has been validated for a few species and applied in the field to estimate local dispersal patterns, further laboratory experiments are necessary to determine appropriate injection concentrations and assess any negative effects on larval and adult condition.
 
 The goal of this study was to conduct a series of laboratory experiments to validate the use of trans-generational marking in clownfishes (genus Amphiprion). In the first experiment, the minimum dose of 137BaCl for successful marking of Amphiprion percula larvae and the period over which females continue to produce marked larvae were evaluated. The effects of barium injections on clutch size, clutch area, size at hatching and subsequent larval growth were also assessed. The fish were subject to three dose levels of 137Ba (0.5, 1.0 and 2.5 Dg 137Ba/g fish weight) and the effectiveness of the mark was quantified by measuring the 138Ba/137Ba ratio at the core of the otoliths of recently metamorphosed larvae. All dose levels were 100% successful in providing unequivocal chemical signatures on offspring otoliths. The two highest dose levels, 1.0 and 2.5 Dg 137Ba/g fish weight, continued to mark larvae over 6 consecutive clutches, extending over a period of 80 days after a single injection. In females injected with the lowest concentration, 0.5 Dg 137Ba/g fish weight, the 138Ba/137Ba ratio returned to the natural barium ratio of 6.385 after 2 clutches (&#8776;40 days). Therefore, while all dose levels could be used to mark larvae, the low dose may require females to be re-injected if longer-term marking is required. Barium injections had no consistent effects on the clutch size (number of eggs) or the clutch area. A significant interaction between treatment and time was detected for both the length and weight of larvae. The females with the highest 137Ba dose, 2.5 Dg 137Ba/g fish weight, produced smaller larvae, but the effect disappeared after the fourth generation. As larval size may be a critical parameter affecting survival, this dosage is not recommended for field studies.
 
 In the second experiment, the effects of 137Ba injections on levels of barium in the tissues of adult females and the period over which barium levels remained elevated were assessed for Amphiprion melanopus. In addition, potential effects on adult condition and stress were also evaluated using plasma cortisol analysis. The barium ratios in four tissues (gonads, liver, muscles and bones) were analysed to determine the retention period of barium following two injection doses (2 Dg and 4 Dg 137Ba/g fish weight). The retained barium level was higher in the bones than in the soft tissues (gonads, liver and muscles) for most sampling times (2, 21 and 56 days). Following the initial elevated barium levels, the ratio of 138Ba/137Ba gradually approached the natural ratio of 6.835, although there was some retention even at 56 days post-injection. The plasma cortisol analysis showed that neither the injection nor the chemical induced any stress to females.
 
 In conclusion, these results suggest barium marking will be 100% effective for marking clownfishes larvae, and provided dose levels are kept to a minimum, there will be no adverse effects on adult females or their offspring.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/3257/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/3257/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Making invisible pathways visible: case studies of Shadow Play and The Rainbow Dark</field><field name="creator">Carless, Victoria Leigh</field><field name="description">This study seeks to articulate a particular type of theatre aesthetic, that which manifests as invisible in the performative mode. This invisiblist theatrical paradigm might comprise an otherness of form, character and/or language in both the written and performed text. The thesis navigates a writer&#8217;s teasing out of aspects of the Invisible for performance, as well as ways in which to plot conditions conducive to an invisiblist theatrical experience. 
 
 The study also looks to a further aspect of invisiblist theatre: its temporality or aliveness, which essentially represents an engagement with the immediate now in performance. This sense of the immediate now is contextualised within the wider or peripheral now - the social/cultural/ political status quo. Aspects of the peripheral now are extrapolated in the context of the works of theorists and theatre practitioners, in order to reflect the values of this epoch, or acknowledge contemporaneity within a theatre piece. 
 
 The outcomes of the research are tested and utilised in the writing and staging of a play entitled The Rainbow Dark (2006). This process was informed by experimentation within a pilot study, implementing a text entitled Shadow Play (2005). The Rainbow Dark (2006) was realised in two different ways; as a reading with Queensland Theatre Company and in performative mode with Backbone Youth Arts; both these realisations took place in Brisbane in 2006. 
 
 The Rainbow Dark (2006) is a hybrid text with an invisiblist aesthetic. It borrows from the peripheral now with its specific political content, yet is able to avoid the effect of rhetoric in performance. Herein lies my potential model for contemporaneity in theatre writing. 
 
 The outcomes of this study also include an ongoing trajectory for the creative project of The Rainbow Dark (2006). The play is currently contracted for broadcast by ABC Radio National, and will also be realised as part of Just Us Theatre Ensemble&#8217;s Independent season in Cairns, in November 2008.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/3565/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/3565/2/02whole_minus_reviews.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Please knock before you enter: an investigation of how rainforest Aboriginal people regulate outsiders and the implications for western research and researchers</field><field name="creator">Martin, Karen</field><field name="description">The regulation of Outsiders to Aboriginal Country is theorised by scholars as invasion and contact, race relations, frontiers and acculturation. In these theories Aboriginal People are represented as powerless and hopeless in the face of their inevitable assimilation. Aboriginal regulation of Outsiders is rarely investigated for Aboriginal agency. This research study investigated the agency of a Rainforest Aboriginal Community, the Burungu, Kuku-Yalanji of Far North Queensland, Australia in the regulation of Outsiders to their country of past, present and future.
	A major feature of this research study is its development of an Indigenist research paradigm founded on the principles of cultural respect and cultural safety and embedded in Aboriginal ontology, epistemology and axiology. It is through an ontological premise of relatedness and with the use of traditional devices such as First Stories and visual Stories that this Indigenist research paradigm makes transparent the assumptions, theory, methodology and ethics of the research study. The theoretical framework, called relatedness theory, is comprised of three conditions: Ways of Knowing, Ways of Being, and Ways of Doing. These conditions articulate particular orientations to knowing, being and doing that are available to Aboriginal scholars. Thus, Indigenist research methodology is both an inquiry and immersion process that is named after the Quampie, the pearl shell and consists of four phases. The first phase begins by working through the three conditions of relatedness theory. The second phase is an inquiry process structured by eight research procedures. The third phase is the immersion in the research study contexts. The fourth phase engages three Indigenist research projects of critique, re-framing and harmonisation to re-represent the research Stories. Quampie methodology, as Indigenist research methodology, requires culturally rigorous choices to be made for methods for data collection. Thus the research study utilised multiple methods for data collection. These are the analysis of literature produced by the Burungu, Kuku-Yalanji and the analysis of selected literature about them; field visits and Storywork. Storywork is a culturally safe, culturally respectful and culturally relevant research method based on Aboriginal epistemology, communication protocols and discourse.
	This research study found the Burungu, Kuku-Yalanji have always exerted agency in the regulation of Outsiders and this is theorised in three forms of relatedness: ngarrbal meaning &#8216;stranger&#8217; is an Outsider who is unknown; waybal meaning &#8216;whiteman&#8217; is an Outsider who is known about, and jarwon meaning &#8216;friend&#8217; is an Outsider who is known. Each form of relatedness is regulated according to the types and levels of physical, social, emotional, cultural and economic relatedness between Burungu, Kuku-Yalanji and the Outsiders. These are either direct or indirect regulations that occur in limited interactions, limited engagements or sustained engagements. Accordingly, ngarrbal, or &#8216;stranger&#8217; is regarded as a temporary state of relatedness by the Burungu, Kuku-Yalanji who regulate and mediate the interactions through series of enfoldments and evolvements. These are established as processes of &#8216;coming amongst&#8217; and &#8216;coming alongside&#8217; the Burungu, Kuku-Yalanji in relatedness as an &#8216;another&#8217;. Outsiders achieve this in fulfilling conditions of honesty, co-operation and respect and at the same time, maintain their own identity and autonomy so that relatedness is expanded and not diminished or replaced. Thereby, the agency of Burungu, Kuku-Yalanji, in the regulation of Outsiders of past, present and future, is as madja, meaning boss, in that they have never excluded anyone who fulfils these conditions but have equally protected their own relatedness.
	The implications and challenges for western research and researchers is to engage research as an interface where conceptual, cultural and historical spaces interface or come alongside each other based on new relationships to knowledge, to research and to self. Thus, Protocols for research developed for this research study demonstrate these different relationships in a research agreement that gives greater agency to the Burungu, Kuku-Yalanji. The Protocols state seven rules for research to direct culturally safe and culturally respectful researcher behaviour and ensure researcher responsibilities and accountabilities to the Burungu, Kuku-Yalanji, the research study and the academy are fulfilled. This stronger dialogic and self-reflexive researcher role works towards addressing, if not neutralising, issues of power of researcher over researched. When research is transformed in this way, it is itself, transformative and works towards achieving Aboriginal sovereignty in research.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4745/1/01Extended_abstract.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A microarray approach to understanding stress in a coral reef fish</field><field name="creator">Kassahn, Karin Sonja</field><field name="description">Coral reef fishes are expected to experience a rise in sea surface temperatures due to climate change. How well tropical reef fishes will respond to these increased temperatures and which genes are important in the response to elevated temperatures is not known. Microarray technology provides a powerful tool for gene discovery studies, but the development of microarrays for individual species can be expensive and time-consuming. There often are, however, microarrays available for related species. I show that inter-species genomic hybridisation experiments can be used to assess which genes are conserved enough for microarray analysis across species, and thus introduce a novel application of microarray technology. I performed a series of tests to determine whether a microarray developed for the zebrafish Danio rerio is useful for measuring gene regulation in the coral reef fish Pomacentrus moluccensis.
 I hybridised genomic DNA from both taxa onto the D. rerio microarray, and based on significant cross-hybridisation, inferred that most genes share significant sequence similarity between the two taxa. I also sequenced eight nuclear genes.
 
 These genes showed an average sequence similarity of 81%. Finally, I used quantitative real-time PCR to validate the microarray data for differential expression.
 The results of the genomic hybridisation experiments, direct sequence comparisons, and quantitative real-time PCR indicate that the D. rerio microarray is useful for measuring gene regulation in P. moluccensis. I then used the D. rerio microarray to characterise the transcriptional responses of P. moluccensis to elevated temperatures over five days. Heat stress elicited differential expression of 324 genes. The functions of heat-responsive genes indicated that prolonged heat exposure leads to oxidative stress and protein damage, challenges the immune system, and causes reallocation of energy sources. I have shown that a temperature increase of three degrees above normal can lead to significant gene regulation in a coral reef fish suggesting that climate change will have measurable impacts upon coral reef fish physiology. In order to identify upstream regulators of the transcriptional responses observed and test for the presence of a general stress response, I measured the early gene responses of P. moluccensis to hypoxic, hyposmotic, cold and heat shock. Early stress responses three hours after exposure were generally associated with a suppression of transcription, but the responses of individual genes varied depending on the type of stressor applied. Only a few genes showed consistent regulation across stress treatments. However, a series of gene functions showed consistent responses across stress treatments, suggesting that there are common effects of stress on biological function. I present a conceptual model of the interactions between stress responses at different levels of biological organisation. I propose that stress commonly leads to a reduction in cellular oxygen levels and oxidative stress.
 
 Reduced cellular oxygen levels initiate endocrine, cardio-respiratory, and cellular responses many of which are aimed at restoring cellular oxygen balance. Oxidative stress in turn activates certain signal transduction pathways, immediate early genes, and transcription factors. The transcriptional stress profiles measured in environmental genomic studies are likely the result of the activation of these redoxsensitive signalling pathways and transcription factors. Further, I tested whether genes with stress-related functions evolve at accelerated rates. To do this, I competitively hybridised genomic DNA from D. rerio and P. moluccensis to a D.
 rerio microarray. 985 genes showed evidence of accelerated rates of sequence evolution between D. rerio and P. moluccensis. Rapidly diverging genes were over-represented for receptor, transcription co-activator, and cell signalling functions, but not for stress-related gene functions. I obtained orthologous sequences to D. rerio for the teleosts Takifugu rubripes and Gasterosteus aculeatus. A selection of rapidly diverging candidate genes showed accelerated rates of sequence evolution across multiple teleost lineages. I have shown that genomic hybridisation experiments on microarrays can be successfully used to identify rapidly diverging genes, in particular in species that currently lack genome sequence data and for which bioinformatic approaches are thus not applicable.

Although much is yet to be revealed about this condition, the main risk factor is the consumption of stale sago starch, a food stuff which is the staple carbohydrate for rural Papua New Guineans. It is thought that fungi that colonise the sago are responsible for the haemolytic compound that cleaves red cell membrane proteins. The condition often manifests in family clusters and a genetic predisposition has been postulated. Melanesian Ovalocytosis (MO), also known as South East Asian Ovalocytosis (SAO), is a autosomal recessive genetic disorder expressing a red cell membrane band 3 deletion in individuals who have inherited the gene responsible. The condition is subclinical but common in rural PNG where it is thought to offer some malaria protection (Bruce et al., 2000). It is reasonable to assume that as this condition is widespread in rural PNG where SHD is endemic, it may a confounding predisposing factor to the manifestation of the acute haemoltyic crisis. 
 
 A number of organisms implicated in SHD have been isolated and crude haemolytic compounds were isolated as per methods of Bernheimer (Bernheimer, 1988). Red cell membrane ghosts where prepared from individuals with and without the MO band 3 deletion and exposed to the toxins. Proteins were separated using Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and the activity of the toxin was demonstrated by the cleaving of band known to be present through comparison  with untreated controls. Although cleavage of bands was demonstrated by various toxin compounds no discernable difference could be identified between the two groups. This may suggest that MO is not involved as a host factor which predisposes SHD, although further studies are required to elucidate this finding.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4776/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4776/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology and conservation of the antilopine wallaroo (Macropus antilopinus)</field><field name="creator">Ritchie, Euan</field><field name="description">Research into the factors which limit the distribution and abundance of species
 has a long tradition in ecology, and knowledge of such factors is vital for guiding the
 conservation of biodiversity. However, few studies have investigated the way in
 which intraspecific and interspecific differences in the niche requirements of species
 vary geographically, despite growing demand for such information in the face of
 large-scale environmental change, particularly the predicted effects of global
 warming.
 
 The antilopine wallaroo (Macropus antilopinus) is a large macropod endemic
 to the extensive tropical savannas of northern Australia. This thesis investigates the
 ecology and conservation of the antilopine wallaroo across its distribution; in
 addition, I provide comparative information on other sympatric macropod species.
 At 50 sites across northern Australia, I collected detailed information on the
 abundance and social behaviour of a number of macropod species as well as and data
 on climate, fire history, habitat and resource availability. Using these data I
 constructed habitat models for species at varying spatial scales. Interpreting broadscale
 patterns of species&#8217; distributions and abundance also requires an understanding
 of the individual requirements of species-specific characteristics, such as socioecology
 and behaviour. Therefore, I also conducted an intensive study of the
 behaviour of the antilopine wallaroo at one site in north Queensland.
 
 The antilopine wallaroo occurred at 68% of the sites that I surveyed, and the
 abundance of this species varied substantially across its distribution. The factors
 influencing the distribution and abundance of the antilopine wallaroo varied
 according to the spatial scale of analysis. At the largest scale (complete distribution),
 availability of water, frequency of fire, geology (soil fertility) and land management
 were the most important factors, whereas within Queensland and at smaller
 bioregional scales, the abundance of a potential competitor (eastern grey kangaroo, M.
 giganteus) and aspects of habitat structure and composition were of greater
 importance. In contrast, the abundance of eastern grey kangaroos and common
 wallaroos (M. robustus) was strongly influenced by climate. The abundance of
 antilopine wallaroos increased after fire whereas the abundance of common wallaroos
 declined.
 
 The antilopine wallaroo was the most gregarious macropod and group sizes
 increased significantly with population density. The eastern grey kangaroo and
 whiptail wallaby (M. parryi) were less gregarious than the antilopine wallaroo, and
 the common wallaroo and agile wallaby (M. agilis) were essentially solitary.
 Compared with other large tropical macropods, the antilopine wallaroo&#8217;s pattern of
 reproduction was strongly seasonal, centred around the monsoon season. There was
 marked seasonal variation in the associations between sex and size classes of the
 antilopine wallaroo, which appear related to reproduction and sexual segregation in
 this species.
 
 Climate change poses a significant risk to the continued survival of the
 antilopine wallaroo. The relatively restricted distribution, dependence on water and
 seasonal breeding pattern of the antilopine wallaroo makes this species the most
 vulnerable of the four large macropods in northern Australia. The capacity for climate
 change to alter habitat structure and influence fire regimes within this region is also
 likely to result in changes to both local and regional macropod communities.
 
 Preliminary genetic data suggest that there has been recent restriction of gene
 flow between populations of antilopine wallaroos in Queensland and the rest of the
 species&#8217; distribution, which may be associated with an arid ecological barrier to
 dispersal at the base of the Gulf of Carpentaria. My results also indicate that
 hybridisation between the antilopine wallaroo and common wallaroo has occurred
 across the former species&#8217; range. Further work is therefore required to resolve the
 taxonomic status of the antilopine wallaroo and the phylogeny of large macropods.
 
 The results of my study provide the most comprehensive information to date
 on the ecology and conservation of the antilopine wallaroo, and also filled a
 significant gap in our overall knowledge of macropodid marsupials by expanding our
 limited knowledge of the tropically-occurring members of this group. More broadly,
 my research has demonstrated spatial variation in the niche requirements of a large
 herbivore and has identified many of the key environmental and biological factors
 influencing the distribution and abundance of species that live in tropical savannas. In
 addition it has made a substantial contribution to a more comprehensive
 understanding of the global ecology and evolution of large herbivores.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4777/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4777/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polybrominated diphenyl ethers: levels in Townsville sediments, depuration and (anti-)estrogenic effects in Barramundi (Lates calcarifer)
</field><field name="creator">Muirhead, Elisabeth Knowles</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research was to study polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and the effect they have in North Queensland, Australia, specifically in reference to a commercially important fish species, barramundi (Lates calcarifer). This thesis is separated into four main sections: determination of PBDE levels in Ross Creek, Townsville, QLD; toxicokinetics of PBDE-47 in barramundi; optimization of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of vitellogenin (Vtg) in barramundi; and assessing the (anti-)estrogenic effect of PBDE-47 in barramundi.
 
 Levels of two common PBDE congeners, PBDE-47 and PBDE-209 were measured in sediments at three sites along Ross Creek in Townsville, QLD. Levels were found to range from below detection (0.2 &#956;g kg-1 dw) to 0.35&#177;0.2 &#956;g kg-1 (dw) for PBDE-47 and from below detection (0.2 &#956;g kg-1 dw) to 0.85&#177;0.07 &#956;g kg-1 (dw) for PBDE-209.
 
 Male juvenile barramundi were injected with either a low (1 mg kg-1 bw) or a high (10 mg kg-1 bw) dose of PBDE-47 and then sampled over the course of 14 days in order to determine the depuration rate of PBDE-47 in barramundi. PBDE-47 was found to depurate at a rate of 0.041- 0.069 day-1, a rate which falls well within the range of the literature for depuration of PBDE-47 in fish.
 
 An optimal ELISA for the detection of Vtg production in barramundi was determined after comparing the component reagents of a pre-existing ELISA with component reagents developed during this study. Two commercially available Vtg standards, a lipophylised Rainbow Trout Vtg standard (RT Vtg standard) and a lipophylised Atlantic Salmon Vtg standard (Salmon Vtg standard) (both from Caymen Chemical Co), were compared to a purified barramundi Vtg fraction obtained after size exclusion chromatography of plasma from barramundi in which Vtg production was induced by repeated injection of large doses of 17&#946;-estradiol (E2). In addition, a commercially available monoclonal mouse anti-striped bass Vtg primary antibody (ND-3G2, Biosense) was compared with two polyclonal sheep anti-barramundi Vtg antibodies (Sh-0404JCU and Sh-0404-SJCU) created by inoculating sheep with one of the size exclusion chromatography purified Vtg fractions. The optimal ELISA was determined to be the preexisting ELISA using ND-3G2 as the primary antibody and RT Vtg standard for quantification, although promising results obtained with the purified barramundi Vtg fractions, Sh-0404JCU and Sh-0404-SJCU suggest that further purification could lead to a better barramundi specific ELISA in the future.
 
 Finally, male, juvenile barramundi were exposed to PBDE-47 in two separate experiments to study whether PBDE-47 has an estrogenic or anti-estrogenic effect, with Vtg production measured by ELISA as the endpoint for estrogenic behaviour.
 
 In the first experiment barramundi were given either a low (1 mg kg-1 bw) or a high (10 mg kg-1 bw) dose of PBDE-47 by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection, and then sampled over the course of 14 days to determine the time course induction of Vtg production. Vtg levels in samples were not quantifiable but the qualitative data allowed for assessment of trends and patterns. Two interesting conclusions were apparent from the data. The first is that male barramundi appear to produce Vtg without exposure to xeno-estrogens, a hypothesis that is supported by literature that has found low natural levels of E2 production in males of many fish species. The second is that the high dose of PBDE-47 suppressed Vtg production between days 7 and 14 with Vtg levels rising much slower in the high dosed fish than in either the control or low dosed fish.
 
 In the second experiment barramundi were given either a single low (1 mg kg-1 bw) or a high (10 mg kg-1 bw) dose of PBDE-47 by i.p. injection then sampled 3 and 6 days after injection, or were given two low (1 mg kg-1 bw) or a high (10 mg kg-1 bw) doses of PBDE-47 by i.p. injection, with three days between injections, then sampled 3 and 6 days after the second injection. This was done to determine whether a repeated dose of PBDE-47 had more of an effect on Vtg production than a single dose. The Vtg levels in these samples was quantifiable and the results showed that a double injection of PBDE-47 significantly suppressed the production of Vtg (P&lt;0.0001) at both a low and high dose. In addition, at 6 days post final injection there was a small, but significant difference (P=0.0355) between the fish that received a single low dose and a single high dose, confirming that a single high dose of PBDE-47 can suppress Vtg production as well.

 reefs worldwide. However, little is known about how sedimentation interacts with other
 environmental factors such as hydrodynamics, temperature and light and how coral
 species vary in their sediment responses. Here, I investigate the response of corals to
 sediment under varying flow, temperature and light regimes in two controlled
 mesocosm experiments, and then preliminarily examine the role of sedimentation in
 structuring coral assemblages using a new method for manipulating sedimentation rates
 in field settings.
 
 The first experiment was designed to test the specific hypothesis that coral stress
 (using the foliaceous Turbinaria mesenterina as a study species) associated with
 sedimentation is reduced under turbulent flow conditions that prevent long-term
 sediment deposition on coral tissues. To provide a rigorous assessment of the
 physiological response, three key physiological parameters were used: tissue lipid
 concentration, skeletal growth rate and photosynthetic performance (maximum quantum
 yield). The second experiment investigated interactions between sediment stress and
 stresses associated with high temperature and light &#8211; a problem highly topical in the
 context of climate change. Lastly, the field experiment consisted of an array of six
 erosive sediment blocks (plaster of paris and silicate-based sediment) suspended above
 the fringing reef at Pelorus Island (Queensland, Australia) to simulate replicate sediment
 gradients. The sediment responses of three coral species (Acropora formosa, Montipora
 tuberculosa, and Porites cylindrica) were followed and compared over a fifteen-day
 sedimentation even, using the relative surface area of tissue lesions/necrosis as the
 response variable.
 
 Experiment 1 demonstrated that sediment concentrations (or sedimentation rates)
 of up to 110.7 &#177; 27.4 mg cm-2 d-1 had no effect on colony growth rate, lipid
 concentration or photosynthetic yield in T. mesenterina under high flow
 (23.7 &#177; 6.7 cm s-1) or stagnant conditions. Also, interactions between flow and sediment
 treatments were non-significant. This is a surprising result that indicates that
 T. mesenterina is highly resistant to sediment deposition under low flow as well as
 sediment abrasion under wave action. Horizontal colonies subjected to sediment loads
 of up to 100 mg cm-2 under stagnant conditions were able to clear their surface within
 two hours, suggesting that rapid and energy efficient clearing of sediment is a key
 mechanism of alleviating sediment stress. These results may explain the success of
 T. mesenterina on reef crests as well as deep reef slopes on highly turbid, inshore coral
 reefs in the Great Barrier Reef lagoon.
 
 Results of experiment 2 showed that sediment treatments of up to
 246 &#177; 47 mg cm-2 d-1 had no effect on colony growth rates, lipid concentrations or
 chlorophyll concentrations in either of the study species under the low (Control) light
 conditions (190 &#177; 60 &#956;mol photons m-2 s-1). In high light (270 &#177; 110 &#956;mol photons
 m 2 s-1), however, lipid and chlorophyll concentrations declined significantly indicating a
 bleaching response. Interestingly, temperature treatments (25.5 &#177; 0.1 and 28.4 &#177; 0.1&#176;C)
 had no effect on the lipid or chlorophyll responses of T. mesenterina. Also, sediment,
 temperature, and light treatments did not interact significantly, further demonstrating
 that the physiology of this species is highly robust to these environmental stressors. Of
 the three physiological responses measured, chlorophyll concentration proved to be the
 most sensitive.
 
 The field experiment (experiment 3) showed contrasting sediment responses
 among the three study species, consistent with predictions based on growth forms.
 Specifically, the prevalence of tissue lesions in M. tuberculosa (flat, foliaceous)
 increased significantly with sedimentation rate, whereas Acropora formosa and Porites
 cylindrica showed minimal tissue lesions, which were not correlated with sedimentation
 rates. This result suggests that sediment can act as a selective pressure on coral reefs,
 potentially related to the functional morphology of the species in the assemblage.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4779/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4779/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impacts of human-mediated disturbances on birds and reptiles in tropical savannas</field><field name="creator">Valentine, Leonie</field><field name="description">Disturbances influence the structure of many ecosystems, determining environmental
 and biological heterogeneity. Human-mediated disturbances, including introduced plant
 species and fire, have the ability to alter ecosystem-level processes and properties,
 modify habitat structure and, as a consequence, influence faunal assemblages. This
 thesis examines the impacts of introduced plant species and fire management practices
 on vertebrate assemblages in grazed tropical savannas in northern Queensland.
 
 Invasive introduced plant species pose a major threat to native environments. Rubber
 vine (Cryptostegia grandiflora) is an environmental weed that invades native riparian
 habitats in northern Australia. Small ground-dwelling lizards may be negatively
 affected as rubber vine replaces and fragments native habitat. Field observations of
 reptiles in habitat invaded by rubber vine recorded only a single lizard in rubber vine
 vegetation, compared to 131 lizards in nearby native vegetation. As rubber vine
 vegetation contains features that superficially resemble native habitat, such as leaf litter,
 the avoidance of rubber vine suggests that rubber vine has underlying characteristics
 that create a suboptimal environmental for lizards.
 
 Two species of native skinks (Carlia munda and C. pectoralis) and the invasive plant
 rubber vine were used as a model system to determine possible underlying mechanisms
 driving avoidance of non-native plants by fauna. In semi-natural enclosures, lizards
 discriminated between leaf litter types: 85% of C. pectoralis and 80% of C. munda
 chose native leaf litter over rubber vine, indicating a clear preference for native habitat.
 In comparison to native habitat, rubber vine provided a suboptimal environment for
 litter-dwelling lizards with lower ambient temperatures, reduced availability of prey and
 a reduction in camouflage from predators (dissimilar leaf and lizard shapes). Thus,
 three possible mechanisms were identified by which an introduced plant species can
 alter the availability of resources in an environment, making it less attractive to native
 fauna. As rubber vine is a Weed of National Significance, management of this species
 is a priority.
 
 Fire plays a pivotal role in structuring ecosystems and often occurs as a humanmediated
 disturbance for land management purposes, including management of
 introduced plants. Rubber vine is susceptible to fire, and burning for weed control may
 be implemented in riparian zones of tropical savannas where rubber vine is prevalent.
 Although tropical savannas are considered fire-adapted ecosystems, riparian vegetation
 and associated fauna may be less resilient to the effects of fire. Variations in fire
 regimes alter the environment in different ways, and the type of fire may govern the
 response of faunal assemblages. Using replicated experimental fire treatments, imposed
 on two habitats (riparian and adjacent woodland), I examined the responses of reptiles
 and birds in the short- and longer-term to a range of fire management practices used to
 control rubber vine.
 
 An important component of fire regime is the season of burn. In tropical savannas,
 most fire management occurs during the dry season; however, wet season burning is
 often used for pastoral management and may be useful for controlling introduced plant
 species. Initially, only one species of reptile responded strongly to burning, with few
 differences detected between burning seasons. Abundances of the skink C. munda were
 higher in burnt sites and may reflect temporary changes in food availability, or a
 reduction in rubber vine. However, the overall structure of the reptile community was
 driven by habitat type (riparian versus woodland) rather than burning, suggesting most
 reptiles were responding to broader environmental factors. Within three years of
 burning, reptiles were least abundant in dry season burnt sites, a result mostly driven by
 the abundance of the small terrestrial gecko, Heteronotia binoei, which was commonly
 observed in unburnt and wet season burnt sites. In addition, litter-associated species,
 including the skink C. pectoralis, were rarely observed in burnt habitat and fewer
 species were detected in the wet season burnt sites.
 
 Both season of burn and time since fire also significantly influenced bird assemblage
 responses. Within 12 months of fire, burning tended to benefit several bird species and
 feeding groups, with higher overall abundances of birds observed in the sites, although
 species that favoured dense vegetation (e.g. red-backed fairy-wren, Malurus
 melanocephalus) were rarely observed in burnt habitat. Responses of feeding groups,
 including insectivores, nectarivores and carnivores, suggest that burning may have
 temporarily increased food resources. In the short-term, assemblage of birds tended to
 reflect whether or not a site was burnt, rather than burning season. However, four years
 following burning, dry season burnt sites were composed of a different bird assemblage
 than unburnt and wet season burnt sites. In addition, dry season burnt treatments were
 characterised by lower bird abundances, especially nectarivore and granivore feeding
 groups and the insectivorous white-throated honeyeater (Melithreptus albogularis). As
 dry season burning removed more vegetation than wet season burning, birds may be
 responding to a reduction in habitat complexity, and subsequent changes in food
 resources.
 
 The frequency with which a habitat is burnt is another critical component of fire regime,
 and may ultimately determine faunal assemblage responses. Using a fully replicated
 Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design I examined the impacts of repeated
 burning on bird assemblages. In contrast to unburnt or singularly burnt sites, the
 repeated burning significantly reduced bird abundance and species richness. Repeat
 burning also altered the feeding group structure of sites. In particular, frugivorous and
 insectivorous birds were adversely affected by the second fire. Vegetation complexity
 was lower in both burning treatments, but the repeatedly burnt sites contained less
 native fruiting shrubs, especially currant bush (Carissa ovata), which was an important
 food and shelter source for several species. Repeatedly burning an area in a short time
 frame may reduce key resources, other than vegetation complexity, such as food
 availability or foraging opportunities.
 
 The use of fire is considered necessary for the maintenance of tropical savannas.
 However, high impact individual fires may detrimentally affect habitat structure and
 faunal assemblages at a local scale. In particular, my results suggest that overall bird
 and reptile assemblages are strongly influenced by management burning, including
 variations in burning season and fire frequency. In an attempt to overcome potential
 negative impacts of burning, ecologists have suggested implementing mosaic burning,
 where a variety of burning regimes are employed. Although mosaic burning
 theoretically provides a diversity of habitat types that consequently maintain high faunal
 diversity, my results suggest that some measures of diversity (e.g. species evenness)
 may be compromised by mosaic burning.
 
 In summary, this study provides evidence that introduced invasive plants and
 management burning play a key role in shaping landscapes and associated faunal
 communities. Fauna respond to disturbance-induced changes in microhabitat and
 vegetation structure, food availability or foraging opportunities, and habitat
 requirements (e.g. temperature). The role of multiple human-mediated disturbances in
 influencing faunal responses in my study is of particular importance. My research was
 conducted in landscapes already disturbed by grazing and invasive species, and the
 responses of fauna may be caused by cumulative impacts. In areas where multiple
 disturbances already influence landscapes, the resilience of faunal assemblages to fire
 management practices may be lower than previously predicted.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4780/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4780/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The evolution of animal societies: monogamy, group-living and conflict in a coral-dwelling fish</field><field name="creator">Wong, Marian</field><field name="description">One of the fundamental goals of behavioural ecology is to understand the evolution of mating systems and determine how they influence the formation, structure and stability of animal societies. Monogamous mating systems are particularly challenging to understand, since one sex generally has a higher potential reproductive rate than the other and should therefore be selected to mate multiply. In addition, monogamous mating systems often occur within the context of social groups. The presence of other group members and hence potential mates makes the evolution of monogamy even more perplexing, since an individual&#8217;s immediate opportunities for polygamy are greatly enhanced. Monogamy within the context of social groups also poses problems for understanding why other group members tolerate group-living, given that they are excluded from reproduction, and how conflict over reproduction between group members is resolved if groups are to be stable. In this thesis, I investigated the ecological determinants of the evolution of monogamy and its consequences for the formation, structure and stability of social groups in a coral-dwelling goby, Paragobiodon xanthosomus (Gobiidae).
 
 In chapter 2, I quantified the social structure of natural groups and determined the mating system of P. xanthosomus. Regardless of group size, groups consisted of one mature male and female plus several smaller immature females that were organised into a size-based dominance hierarchy. Observations of breeding behaviour confirmed that P. xanthosomus exhibits a monogamous mating system in which only the mature male and female breed at the expense of the other female group members. To address the evolution of monogamy despite the immediate availability of multiple females within groups, I used field and aquarium experiments to test whether competition between females over limiting nest sites, food or paternal care constrained males to monogamy. Supplemental feeding increased the fecundity of breeding females, suggesting that food is a limited resource for reproduction. Supplemental feeding did not however result in the maturation of other female group members. This suggests that monogamy has evolved because dominant females suppress the reproduction of subordinate females because they are competitors for limited food. Finally, males in pairs that received supplemental food exhibited a diminishing ability to care for enlarged clutches laid by similarly-sized breeding females. This suggests that constraints on paternal care provide additional benefits for females from maintaining a monogamous mating system.
 
 In chapter 3, I investigated the consequences of the monogamous mating system on the maintenance of group-living in P. xanthosomus. Specifically, I applied cooperative breeding theory to determine the factors promoting group-living by non-breeding subordinates given that they obtain no current reproduction within groups due to the monogamous mating system. Using field and aquarium experiments in which coral saturation, costs of movement between corals and the size of available corals was manipulated, I demonstrated that non-breeding group members tolerate group-living because of high costs of movement and benefits from inheriting a territory of high quality. In contrast, coral saturation and position in the hierarchy appeared to have no effect on the occurrence of subordinate dispersal.
 
 In chapter 4, I investigated the mechanisms involved in resolving conflict over rank between group members, and thus promoting the stability social groups given the unequal distribution of reproduction between group members due to the monogamous mating system. Specifically, I tested whether the combination of punishment by dominants in the form of eviction from the group, and cooperation by subordinates in the form of growth regulation had evolved as a means of conflict resolution. Firstly, I conducted a removal experiment in the field and showed that non-breeding subordinate group members form size-based queues in which they wait to inherit dominant breeding status. Conflict over reproduction should be particularly intense in queues since subordinates gain no reproduction while they wait and face the prospect of dying before inheriting a breeding position. Detailed quantification of size ratios between individuals of adjacent rank in groups revealed a prevalence of a specific size ratio between individuals, and analysis of individual growth rates in the field demonstrated that the specific size ratio is maintained over time via the regulation of subordinate growth rates. Staged contest experiments in aquaria between individuals of adjacent rank revealed that the specific size ratio represents a threshold above which subordinates can evict their immediate dominant from the group, but are much more likely to be evicted by their immediate dominant themselves. This suggest that threshold size ratios are being maintained by subordinates as a form of cooperation whereby they avoid becoming a threat to their immediate dominants, and that such cooperation arises in response to the threat of punishment by dominants. Societies in P. xanthosomus are therefore being stabilised as a result of punishment and cooperation acting in concert to promote the resolution of conflict over rank between group members. 
 
 Finally in chapter 5, I used a supplemental feeding and removal experiments to explicitly test whether: (1) disproportional acquisition of food resources as a result of differential competitive ability contributed to the maintenance of size differences between individuals within size-based queues, and (2) subordinates are capable of regulating their own growth to avoid inflicting costs on dominants. Supplemental feeding resulted in elevated growth rates of subordinates in both the presence and absence of the breeding female, suggesting that food limitation on subordinates due to competitive exclusion by dominants promotes the maintenance of size differences within size-based queues. Feeding of rank 4 subordinates resulted in some restraining their own growth by reducing their food intake, demonstrating that subordinates are capable of regulating their own growth to avoid breaching the threshold size ratio. The remaining rank 4 subordinates grew in breach of the threshold size ratio and were consequently evicted from the group, suggesting that food availability may also influence the stability of queues. Taken together, both competition over food and subordinate growth restraint in response to the threat of eviction appear to be important in regulating subordinate growth rates and in maintaining well-defined size differences within size-based queues, although social regulation is likely to be the primary factor ensuring the stability of P. xanthosomus societies over time. 
 
 In summary, this thesis represents a quantitative and systematic investigation into the mechanisms responsible for, and the links between, the evolution and maintenance of monogamy, social groups, and conflict resolution in a monogamous, group-living fish. In so doing, it provides a comprehensive picture of the mechanisms underlying the formation, structure and stability P. xanthosomus societies, and contributes to a greater understanding of the processes governing the evolution and maintenance of animal societies in general.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4781/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4781/2/02whole.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4781/3/03Appendix_1.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hydrothermal processes at the Osborne Fe-Oxide-Cu-Au deposit, N.W. Queensland: integration of multiple micro-analytical data sets to trace ore fluid sources</field><field name="creator">Fisher, Louise</field><field name="description">The Osborne mine exploits one of several significant iron oxide-copper gold (IOCG)
 deposits in the eastern part of the Proterozoic Mount Isa Inlier (Cloncurry District) in
 NW Queensland. Cu-Au bearing sulphides at Osborne are associated with volumes of
 massive, coarse grained quartz (silicification) which was precipitated both pre- and synore
 deposition. This extensive quartz is a feature unique to Osborne and make it ideal
 for a fluid inclusion study. The ore forming fluids were examined by several bulk and
 microanalytical techniques. The fluid history of the deposit has been evaluated by
 microscope petrography and the physical conditions under which the fluids were
 trapped, and their compositions were estimated using microthermometry, laser Raman
 spectroscopy, proton induced X-ray emission (PIXE) and laser ablation inductively
 coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). The source of the fluids and their
 salinities were studied using combined noble gas and halogen analysis utilising a
 neutron activation-mass spectrometric method on bulk samples and PIXE analysis.
 
 Petrographic studies show complex assemblages of fluid inclusions in which both pre and
 post-ore depositional ore fluids are identified. Primary multi-solid fluid inclusions
 (MS), some with a carbon dioxide component (CB), trapped at 340 - &gt;600oC with ultrahigh
 salinity (&lt;64 wt% NaCl equiv.), are correlated with the massive quartz
 precipitation event. High salinity (17-38 wt% NaCl equiv) pseudosecondary and
 secondary liquid-vapour &#177; halite fluid inclusions (LVD) were trapped at 105-292oC and
 lie on trails that emanate from chalcopyrite and are interpreted to relate to Cu-Au
 mineralisation and a second phase of quartz deposition. The decrease in temperature
 and salinity over the period of ore formation is attributed to fluid mixing.
 
 Thermal and mechanical decrepitation of the fluid inclusion populations permitted
 semi-selective analysis of different fluid inclusion populations and a comparison of the
 noble gas and halogen composition of the ore fluids with those of the pegmatites. The
 halogen data for the Osborne deposit indicate multiple sources of salinity suggesting
 mixing between at least two components; the fluids with the highest values of Br/Cl =
 3.8 &#215;10-3 and I/Cl = 27.4 &#215; 10-6 are similar to bittern brine compositions and those with
 the lowest values of Br/Cl = 0.3&#215;10-3 and I/Cl = 2.4 &#215;10-6 are similar to halite
 dissolution waters. Values for pegmatitic quartz hosted fluids fall within these ranges.
 The data are consistent with mixing between crustal fluids of diverse origin. 40Ar/36Ar
 values of &lt;2000 and 36Ar concentrations of 1- 6 ppb are most similar to sedimentary
 formation waters but a metamorphic component, derived from devolatisation reactions
 during regional metamorphism, can not be excluded. The similar values obtained for
 samples of pegmatitic quartz support the presence and inclusion of ore fluids at the time
 of pegmatite anatexis. The moderately high 36Ar concentrations in the ore fluids and
 their low 40Ar/36Ar values preclude the involvement of magmatic fluids derived from Atype
 granites with a deep crust or mantle origin.
 
 Compositional data obtained using PIXE and LA-ICP-MS shows significant
 compositional variation within single inclusion populations. A two order of magnitude
 range of Br/Cl ratios (0.2 &#8211; 18 &#215;10-3) correlates with noble gas and halogen data and
 indicates multiple sources of salinity. Low concentrations of copper in the high salinity
 ore fluids (Cu&lt;&lt;150ppm) suggest that changes in control factors of copper solubility
 were important in the formation of the deposit. At temperatures of 600oC, the Osborne
 ore fluids would be undersaturated with respect to chalcopyrite. Cooling, dilution and redox changes caused by interaction with host rocks and/or fluid mixing are interpreted
 to be the main controls on deposition.
 
 Geochemical modelling of the ore forming processes, using HCh, suggests that a redox
 switch from hematite-stable conditions to magnetite-stable conditions could have
 triggered chalcopyrite precipitation during rock-buffered fluid mixing. Modelling
 suggests highest ore grades would be associated with pyrrhotite-bearing assemblages.
 
 Data collected during this study indicate that cooling, dilution and redox changes
 caused by interaction with host rocks and/or fluid mixing are likely to have been the
 main controls on deposition at the Osborne deposit. Furthermore, halogen and noble
 gas data provide strong evidence that magmatic fluids are not a ubiquitous component
 of IOCG ore forming systems.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4782/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4782/2/02Chapters1-3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4782/3/03Chapters4-6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4782/4/04BibApp.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">I live my life according to the pain: the lived experience of chronic pain in adults living in rural Queensland</field><field name="creator">Tollefson, Joanne</field><field name="description">Chronic pain is ubiquitous in people all over the world. Australia is no exception, with up to a fifth of the population claiming that they have experienced chronic pain over the past year. Chronic pain has been explored in a multitude of studies over the past century, with the majority being quantitative studies aimed at understanding the patho-psycho-physiological aspects of pain, or the psychological/behavioural management issues. More recently, qualitative studies have been undertaken to begin to understand the individual person&#8217;s perspective on chronic pain in an attempt to inform health care professionals so they can better assist those they care for to live with their pain. In this study, living in rural areas provided a contextual background to living with chronic pain. Geographical distance often imposes restrictions on the health care services that are available, and these restrictions increase the impact of living with chronic pain in a rural area. The aim of this study was to answer the question: What is it like to live with chronic pain in a rural area of Queensland? An interpretive study using van Manen&#8217;s (1997) approach to hermeneutic phenomenology explored the experiences of seven adults living with chronic pain in rural areas of Queensland. Hermeneutic phenomenology was chosen as the underlying philosophy for this study. Conversational interviews were conducted with adults between the ages of 23 and 55 years in small towns in several parts of Queensland. The interviews were transcribed verbatim, and the resulting transcripts analysed using van Manen&#8217;s (1997) analytic approach. Several sub-themes emerged and fell into the four existential concepts or essences described by van Manen: spatiality, temporality, corporeality and relationality. 
 
 Spatiality - &#8216;The country style of life&#8217; included four sub-themes. &#8216;Distance is the biggest problem&#8217; spoke of geographical distance to sophisticated health care that was found to be a problem, both in additional physical discomfort during travel, and in personal and financial costs. As well, a diminution or lack of health care services in country areas was apparent. &#8216;Living in a small town&#8217; assists the person to deal with their chronic pain quietly and privately. The &#8216;Safety and comfort of living in a small town&#8217; revolved around the trust and the relationships participants developed with community members over the years. &#8216;Retreating to private spaces&#8217; permitted disengagement from others, both mentally and physically, fostering relaxation and reducing pain.
 
 Temporality - &#8216;This is my life now&#8217;, was constituted by four sub-themes. The temporal discontinuity between &#8216;what was&#8217; and &#8216;what is now&#8217; was explored in &#8216;I am different to what I was&#8217;. Grief was endured because of these changes and lives and identities were fragmented. As part of this experience, participants also attempted to retrieve a sense of self. &#8216;This is my life now&#8217; told of the endurance and acceptance of the pain, and the recognition that the pain would be a constant companion. &#8216;Things will not improve&#8217; extended this theme with reference to uncertainty, maintaining independence and the value of distraction. &#8216;Pace of life in the country&#8217; demonstrated some of the positive factors that assisted with living with chronic pain in a rural area &#8211; quiet, fewer interactions and the slower rhythm of the country lifestyle.
 
 Corporeality - &#8216;Some days are better than others&#8217; included four sub-themes. &#8216;Pain is invisible &#8211; but it really does hurt&#8217;, related the psychological burden of not being able to actually demonstrate the hurt, and feeling like a fraud. &#8216;Difficult to name &#8211; all there is is the pain&#8217; emphasised participants&#8217; inability to articulate pain and the increased necessity for health care professionals to be astute in their assessment of the person living with chronic pain. &#8216;What&#8217;s wrong? What&#8217;s wrong? &#8211; the meaning of pain&#8217; tells of making sense of the pain for peace of mind and giving it a name so as to legitimize it. &#8216;Balancing the pain&#8217; brought forth the experience of persisting versus pacing of activities to reduce the effects of the pain, being aware of personal limitations, use of analgesia, and distraction to cope with the pain. &#8216;Mind over matter &#8211; the scary mental side of things&#8217; tells of believing in their own body rather than worrying that they were losing their mind, the effects of mind over the somatic body and of depression, of memory loss and of cognitive dysfunction. 
 
 Relationality - &#8216;Relationships in Pain&#8217; included four sub-themes. &#8216;Silence on pain&#8217; relates stoicism, reticence about the pain, independence and perseverance. &#8216;Privacy &#8211; you don&#8217;t have to look and act happy&#8217; protects as it keeps the pain from others. &#8216;Support and comfort&#8217; from family, friends, community, animal companions and God helps cope with the pain. Good, solid family relationships empower, but as the circle widens, support and comfort became less apparent. &#8216;He just doesn&#8217;t understand&#8217; paints a telling story of participants&#8217; relationships with health care professionals. Inadequate care and difficult interactions were often experienced. As a consequence, traveling great distances to consult compassionate doctors occurred, although nurses were seldom mentioned. 
 
 Several key recommendations arose from the findings of this study. In respect to education, suggestions for future curricula development to help health care professionals to learn to provide more empathetic assistance to people living with chronic pain were made. In respect to clinical practice, the development more effective strategies to assist people living with chronic pain is suggested. Advanced practice nurses with an interest in, and further studies in assessing and managing chronic pain are needed in rural areas, both as practitioners and as mentors to other nurses. Adoption of standardised pain management strategies by professional organisations, and especially dissemination of these through their rural networks would assist health care professionals to practice in a consistent and contemporary way. The importance of aggressive and thorough pain assessment of people seeking health care advice in rural areas is an important finding in this study and should be utilized by all first-contact health care professionals. 
 
 In reference to research, specific recommendations were made. Since pain assessment and pain management are currently taught in the health care disciplines and have been for at least a couple of decades (personal experience), research projects are urgently needed to determine why this knowledge has not translated into practice in order to address the indifference, lack of knowledge and the stigma that people living with chronic pain face from the professionals who are supposed to assist them. Further qualitative studies are recommended to increase the scope of knowledge of the experiences of people living with chronic pain in rural areas.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4783/1/Thesis_front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4783/2/Thesis_whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecomorphology, microhabitat use, performance and reproductive output in tropical lygosomine lizards</field><field name="creator">Goodman, Brett</field><field name="description">Ecomorphology is the study of correlations between morphology and habitat(s) in organisms. If morphology is tightly correlated with habitat, then differences in morphology should directly affect fitness via their effect on performance within specific habitats. Despite the generality of this approach, clear correlations between habitat use, morphology, and performance have been established for few vertebrate groups. Furthermore, no study has examined whether correlations between habitat use and morphology may affect fitness via an effect on reproductive output. This thesis examines the relationships between microhabitat use, morphology, performance and reproductive output among scincid lizards from tropical north east Australia.
 
 My examination of microhabitat use, temporal activity and size for 21 skink species from five assemblages (Alligator Creek, Cairns, Chillagoe, Cooktown and Mt. Bartle Frere), revealed that species separated along two gradients of structural microhabitat use: one that ranged from large rocks to leaf litter, and a second that ranged from closed habitats (high in leaf litter, ground cover, undergrowth, proximity to vegetation and increased canopy cover) to open habitats (low in all these characteristics). Species used microhabitats non-randomly, with species from the same ecotype (arboreal, generalist, litter-dwelling, rock-using) clustering in multivariate ecological space. Despite considerable niche overlap, null-model comparisons revealed only one assemblage (Chillagoe) had greater niche overlap than expected by chance. Assemblages with more species occupied smaller niche space, indicating species packing, however, species with more diverse niches were less evenly packed. Most species overlapped in activity time and size, suggesting that structural microhabitat is the dominant axis decreasing competitive interactions, allowing coexistence within these assemblages of tropical skinks. Sexual differences in morphology were examined for 18 skink species that occupy a range of habitats. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that females from rocky environments evolved longer limbs and shorter abdomens compared to those from leaf litter. In males, use of rocky habitats was correlated with the evolution of a flatter, shorter body. The use of more open habitats was correlated with an evolutionary increase in limb length and a decrease in abdomen length in females, and an increase in limb length in males. Phylogenetic comparisons among generalist, leaflitter and rocky habitat species revealed that males from rocky habitats were flatter than generalist and leaf-litter species, with females less stockier than males.
 
 Selection for body flattening in females appears constrained, or weaker than for
 males, presumably due to the antagonistic effect of fecundity selection to maximize
 space for eggs. The more extreme flattening of male lizards from rocky habitats may
 assist locomotor performance, male-male contests or the use of refugia. Phylogenetic analyses of males from 18 species revealed a tight positive correlation between sprinting and climbing ability, and climbing and clinging ability.
 There was no trade-offs among these performance traits, such as that observed in studies of arboreal lizards. Morphologically derived species were better at sprinting, climbing and clinging, which are presumably sufficiently similar tasks for scincid lizards that no trade-offs were observed. Although biomechanical models predict that flatness should enhance climbing speed, there was no evidence that a flat body assisted in climbing in this study. Similarly, biomechanical models predict that long limbs should enhance jumping ability, but no such correlation was observed in my study.
 
 Five conceptual models of lizard locomotion relating to habitat use and morphology (limb length) were examined using 18 species of skink. Both differences and similarities between the sexes in the relationships between microhabitat use and performance were observed. Male and female skinks both responded to increased habitat openness by evolving greater sprint speeds. However, males in open habitats also had faster climbing speeds, and better clinging ability than those from closed habitats; enhanced clinging ability is likely beneficial for increased climbing speed, or correlated selection on these two traits. While these relationships were in the same direction, they were less robust or non-significant for females. Intersexual differences in performance resulting from natural selection for improved locomotor function in particular habitats may be eroded in females by sexual selection (e.g., for increased fecundity). Moreover, specialized leaf-litter dwelling species had poor performance at all performance traits examined, suggesting that these traits were not relevant to specialisation to a leaf litter habitat, or that selection on these traits is relaxed as there is more reliance on crypsis.
 
 Body flattening was negatively correlated with abdominal volume, such that flatter species had lower abdominal volumes. Abdominal volume was strongly correlated with reproductive output (RCM), and flatter species had lower reproductive output. Thus, body shape determines reproductive output by imposing a constraint on clutch mass. The tight correlation between abdominal shape and both RCM and habitat, suggests changes in body shape are adaptive and may have a functional role (e.g., using rock-crevices). Thus, adaptive changes in morphology can influence fitness without affecting performance. This study shows that for this group of Lygosomine lizards there is a clear evolutionary pathway between clutch mass and body shape, with body shape acting as a constraint on clutch mass and therefore, reproductive output.
 
 Structural microhabitat use provides the dominant axis separating and allowing coexistence among this group of diurnal tropical skinks in northeast Australia. Morphological adaptation in this group of tropical lizards to two habitat gradients and in response to three categories of habitat use has led to convergence in morphology and performance, however, sexual differences were detected. The increased use of rocky and/or open habitats by species has led to evolutionary increases in running speed, climbing speed and cling ability, with performance of females lagging behind that of males. These sexual differences in morphology appear to be the result of the antagonistic effects of natural selection for performance, offset by sexual selection that affects the sexes differently. Finally, adaptive changes in morphology and body shape in response to these habitats have led to changes in reproductive output.

However, many of these potential controls have been suggested on a qualitative rather than a quantitative basis. Whereas fractal analysis of mineral deposit distributions simply considers the location of the deposits, multifractal analysis can examine variation in values of attributes assigned to each deposit location such as deposit size. Yet no comprehensive study of the multifractal properties of mineral production data has been presented.
 
 Coupled deformation and fluid flow modelling has been used to verify sites of importance for mineralization in both two- and three-dimensional modelling space.
 Numerical modelling in three-dimensions of strike-slip faulting has yet to fully examine the effect of variation in fault geometry. Quantitative analysis of model outputs can provide criteria for ranking of different fault geometry parameters in terms of their relative prospectivity.
 
 The Proterozoic Mount Isa Inlier is a rich base metal province in northwest Queensland,
 Australia. As a well studied and well mineralized terrain, with comprehensive literature, and detailed geological and mineral deposit databases available, the Mount Isa Inlier is an ideal study area for investigating and verifying new techniques for brownfields exploration targeting. A quantitative examination of the controls on base metal deposition in the Mount Isa Inlier has substantial implications for future exploration in the region, with the techniques being readily applicable to other study areas and commodities.
 
 A new method is presented which evaluates mineral occurrence distributions by combining fractal analysis of clustering with Weights of Evidence (WofE). Variation in clustering of copper occurrences from the Mount Isa Inlier has a strong positive correlation with variation in clustering of fault bends (R=0.823), fault intersections (R=0.862), and mafic intrusions (R=0.885). WofE analysis as quantified by contrast values indicates that the copper occurrences have a strong spatial association with fault intersections, and fault bends. Correlation of the variation of clustering of copper occurrences and geological features shows a linear relationship with the contrast values indicating that the geological features controlling the clustering of the copper occurrences may be the same features controlling their localization.
 
 A fractal dimension can be used to quantify geological complexity, which characterises the distribution of faults and lithological boundaries. Two-dimensional analysis of geological complexity in the Mount Isa Inlier suggests that there exists a strong spatial relationship between geological complexity and copper endowment (R=0.914). A weak inverse relationship exists between complexity gradients and copper endowment. The results indicate that geological complexity could be used as an exploration targeting tool
 for copper in the Mount Isa Inlier.
 
 The de Wijs model was developed to describe the distribution of element enrichment and depletion in the crust. An expansion of the de Wijs model is presented to investigate the distribution of ore tonnage as well as grade. The expanded model produces a log-normal relationship between ore tonnage and grade. Multifractal analysis suggests that ore tonnage values from the expanded model are not multifractal. Analysis of production data from the Zimbabwe craton displays a log-normal relationship between ore tonnage and grade, and indicates that ore tonnage is not multifractal, as suggested by the expanded de Wijs model.
 
 Variation of fault bend and fault jog system geometry parameters during coupled deformation and fluid flow modelling of strike-slip faulting reveals that having a low dipping fault, a contrast in lithology and a wide fault width generates the highest dilation and integrated fluid flux values which can be considered proxies for prospectivity. It is demonstrated that little difference is seen between the results obtained for restraining and releasing fault bend and fault jog geometries. The fault geometries observed in the modelling to be the most prospective could be incorporated into exploration targeting strategies.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4785/4/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4785/3/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Load-deformation characteristics of minefills with particular reference to arching and stress developments</field><field name="creator">Pirapakaran, Kandiah</field><field name="description">Mining is one of the major export industries in Australia. When the ore is removed from the ground voids are backfilled. There are different types of backfills depending on their nature and usage. Hydraulic and paste fill are most common backfills in industry. The strength and drainage properties of hydraulic fills are required for better design and safety of the mines and miners. Arching is a well known phenomenon identified in geotechnical and mining applications as reduction in the vertical stresses compared to overburden pressure at any depth within the fill. Paste fill is a popular and relatively new minefill that is used for backfilling underground voids created in the process of mining. The binder used in paste fill, typically at dosage of 3% - 5%, contributes significantly to the cost of backfilling. While Ordinary Portland cement (OPC) has been the typical binder in paste fills, there is an increasing trend to replace OPC with blended cements that include OPC mixed with fly ash, slag and lime at different proportions in an attempt to minimize the cost.
 
 This research presents a study that utilizes a laboratory model and the two and three-dimensional finite difference packages FLAC and FLAC3D to investigate the arching effects including the consideration of interface elements between rock and backfill, stope geometry and shear strength parameters. An arching effect instrument was developed and was used to investigate the stress developments within circular and square stopes, which were found similar to the results of numerical modelling. Stress values in the circular stopes were approximately 85% of square stopes from the experimental model.
 
 Further, an analytical solution was developed from Marston&#8217;s solutions for investigating stress developments within rectangular, square/circular and narrow stopes. The research was extended to develop models for narrow and rectangular stopes using FLAC and FLAC3D, respectively. The improved model of narrow stopes was verified against Aubertin et al. (2003) and extended further by incorporating interface elements between rock and backfill. FLAC axi-symmetric model for circular stopes was compared with Rankine (2004) FLAC3D model. Finally, the findings for narrow stopes were verified with Knutsson&#8217;s (1981) in situ measurements.
 
 Blended cements are generally characterised by very slow early strength development, followed by the attainment of good ultimate strength. Blends comprising of 100% OPC, 75% OPC &amp; 25% fly-ash and 30% OPC &amp; 70% slag were tested, adding 3%, 3.5% and 4% binder to tailings having solids contents of 7%, 80% and 81%. The specimens were subjected to uniaxial compressive strength after curing periods of 7, 14, 28, 56 and 90 days. The short-term flow characteristics of 3.5% paste fill mixes with each type of binder were investigated using yield stress tests. The results provided an understanding of the effect of solids contents, binder contents and curing period in the selection of optimal paste fill mixture. It was observed that slag-based paste fill had higher strength compared to the other two paste fills, however after considering the cost of binders, the 3% slag-based binder with 79% solids content in the paste fill and 3.5% Flyash-based binder with 80% solids content in the paste fill were chosen as optimal mixtures for strength and flow properties. Also, long term strength was investigated on Cannington mine tailings using Portland cement, but only for 79% and 83% solids content in the paste fill.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4789/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4789/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of the ecology of tabanid flies (Family Tabinidae) in North Queensland and their potential to transmit Trypanosoma evansi</field><field name="creator">van Hennekeler, Kirsty</field><field name="description">Surra, the disease caused by the protozoal parasite, Trypanosoma evansi, is characterised by weight loss, anaemia, dependent oedema and death in susceptible animals. It affects all mammalian species tested, and is known to cause acute disease with high mortalities in wallabies and kangaroos (Reid et al., 2001). There is no evidence of presence of T. evansi in Australia, however it is considered a high biosecurity risk as it has the potential to cause significant economic loss due to livestock death and weight loss, as well as a possibly devastating effect on native wildlife (Reid, 2002; AFFA, 2003). 
 
 Tabanid flies (also called march flies or horse flies), especially the genus Tabanus, are considered the primary vectors of surra (Nieshulz, reviewed by Krinsky 1979). The distribution, abundance and population dynamics of insect vectors all influence the risk of T. evansi transmission. The risk of incursion is considered to be greatest in the northern-most parts of Queensland, Australia (Reid, 2002; Thompson et al., 2003a). Disease surveillance is expensive and logistically difficult in this region due to the low population density and remote location. Little historical information was available on the ecology of tabanid flies in Australia, so the main aim of this study was to seek ecological data on tabanids that would promote understanding of the times and places that tabanid abundance occurred in northern Queensland. This information would then be extrapolated over the northern Australian region and used in the production of risk maps for surra in Australia. 
 
 In this study, data on tabanid flies was collected in north Queensland over 21 months, and the weather and other environmental factors that were significantly related to their abundance was determined. This information was then applied to a GIS and the annual and spatial abundance of likely vector species was mapped. These maps will be used in conjunction with additional data on host animal density and distribution and disease spread between animals to provide risk maps that will help focus disease surveillance activities in areas of highest risk. 
 
 The yearly abundance of Tabanus spp. was greatest in the most northern part of Cape York Peninsula, and was related to average annual minimum temperature and solar radiation values. This area of northern Queensland corresponds to a high geographical risk of surra incursion associated with the proximity to West Irian (Indonesia) and Papua New Guinea, which is thought to be the likely route of entry for surra into Australia. In addition, species of Tabanus are present for an average of 11 months of the year in this region, as a result of a wide variety of species present in this area, including the presence of T. ceylonicus, which is active during the dry season. This indicates that there is a confluence of risk factors in the most northern part of Cape York, which increases the risk of incursion and establishment of surra in this region.
 
 Other aspects of tabanid behaviour and ecology were also studied. It was established that the Nzi trap was the most efficient means of trapping tabanids in Australia, and that attractants greatly improved capture rates. Also the times of greatest daily activity, and activity between days, differed among various tabanid species and this was related to variation in response to meteorological variables. 
 
 This study has established relationships among tabanid numbers and weather and environmental factors. This has elucidated the annual temporal and spatial abundance patterns of tabanids in the north Queensland region. This information will provide the basis for further studies that further establish the links between vector intensity and disease incidence in surra endemic countries, which will in turn allow a greater understanding of the epidemiology of this disease.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4826/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4826/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ngalpun adhabath a goeygayil bangal (our sea, our future): an examination of Torres Strait Protected Zone Joint Authority principles and Torres Strait Islander needs and aspirations for the Torres Strait fisheries, from a Torres Strait Islander perspective</field><field name="creator">Loban, Frank</field><field name="description">The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People: Articles 18, 23 and 26, states that an
 Indigenous person has the right to participate fully at all levels of decision making in matters which may
 affect their lives, they have the right to develop strategies for economic gains, and the right to own,
 develop, control and use of their lands including waters and coastal seas (Human Rights Council,
 2006). Zenadhaw Mabaygka (Torres Strait Islanders) are traditional owners of the islands and seas that
 are located between the most northern point of Kie Daudai (Australia) and the western coast of Migi
 Daudai (Papua New Guinea). Occupation of the islands and seas in Zenadh Kes (Torres Strait) by
 Zenadhaw Mabaygka dates back almost 3000 years (Carter,2004). Their traditional knowledge of their
 environment has evolved over the generations.
 
 The current fishery governance regime in the Zenadh Kes, the Torres Strait Protected Zone Joint
 Authority or PZJA has a policy of maximizing the opportunities for Zenadhaw Mabaygka participation in
 all sectors of the fishing industry, and has limited non-islander participation in the Zenadh wapiw
 (Torres Strait fisheries). Since 1985 the PZJA has prevented further expansion by this group through
 the requirement that non-islanders must purchase an existing license to gain access to the fishery
 (PZJA Annual Report, 2002: 8). Growth in the Zenadh wapiw, where there is scope for expansion, has
 been reserved exclusively for Zenadhaw Mabaygka. However, Zenadhaw Mabaygka participation in the
 actual governance structure, where management decisions are made for the Zenadh wapiw, is that of
 an advisory role, not a decision-making role.
 
 Zenadhaw Mabaygka has an advisory role in the current fishery governance regime through the PZJA. The PZJA was established under the Torres Strait Treaty 1984 No. 4.This Treaty was negotiated
 between Kie Daudai and Migi Daudai in 1978 and ratified into Kie Daudai law in 1985. The Treaty
 recognizes the importance of protecting the traditional way of life as well as the livelihood of Zenadhaw
 Mabaygka. However, it fails to secure equal power and benefit sharing for its primary stakeholders,
 Zenadhaw Mabaygka. This principle is reflected throughout relevant Kie Daudai legislation and the
 PZJA.
 
 My thesis argues that the contemporary logic of this Treaty commitment to protect the way of life as well
 as the livelihood of Zenadhaw Mabaygka requires a governance regime that guarantees benefit sharing
 and that this guarantee can only be achieved through power sharing. Today the way of life and
 livelihoods of Zenadhaw Mabaygka must involve them fully in both traditional as well as the commercial fisheries. To reflect contemporary economic reality and Zenadhaw Mabaygka aspirations the present
 governance regime requires a re-arrangement of governance mechanisms, a re- articulation of the
 guiding principles and a modest amendment to the enabling rules. The re-arrangements are needed to
 empower authentic participation in power sharing through decision-making processes that will
 accommodate Zenadhaw Mabaygka as key actors in the regime by acknowledging them as in the
 principal stakeholders in the fisheries.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4829/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4829/2/02whole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of blasting on the stability of paste fill stopes at Cannington Mine</field><field name="creator">van Gool, Bronwyn</field><field name="description">Paste fill is a cemented backfill used to fill the void left by mining to provide stability to the
 mine. It consists of tailings mixed with a small percentage of cement and water. As the mining
 sequence progresses and stopes adjacent to the fill are mined, the fill is subjected to blasting
 loads, and subsequently exposed. The purpose of this thesis was to study the effects of blast
 loading on paste fill, and the research consisted of experimental and numerical modelling
 components and some field work at Cannington mine.
 
 The field work involved monitoring of paste fill during production blasts, in situ tests in paste
 fill at Cannington mine and laboratory tests on the paste fill samples. Triaxial geophones were
 installed in stope 4261 at Cannington Mine, which had previously been mined and filled with
 paste fill. These geophones were used to measure the velocity waveforms produced in the stope
 during the blasting in two adjacent stopes. The data collected as part of this field work resulted
 in the estimation of a peak particle velocity at which paste fill begins to fail.
 
 The in situ tests involved monitoring the explosion of 9 blast holes in paste fill. Triaxial
 geophones were used to measure the velocity profile of each blast. The blast holes were
 detonated individually in order to obtain separate velocity profiles. The results were used to
 obtain a relationship between the peak particle velocity and the scaled distance from the blast.
 
 The laboratory tests were conducted to measure the attenuation of a wave as it travels through a
 column of paste fill. Paste fill was poured into a 2.7 m long column in which 4 accelerometers
 were installed. A wave was induced in the column by striking the end of a column with a
 hammer and the particle acceleration was measured. The results were used to show the effect of
 paste fill mix on the attenuation of a wave.
 
 The finite element method based numerical modelling package, ABAQUS/Explicit, was used to
 model the behaviour of paste fill due to adjacent blasting in an underground mine. The first
 numerical model consisted of a single column of explosive detonated in paste fill. The results
 of this model were validated against the data obtained in the field tests. Once validated, the
 model was run for different mixes of paste fill to observe the effect of cement and solids content
 of the paste fill on its behaviour. A model of a single column of explosive in rock was also
 developed and validated using the same method. The model was then extended to include a
 single column of explosive detonated in rock adjacent to a paste fill stope. This model was run
 for a variety of blasting conditions to observe the changes in paste fill behaviour due to different
 blasting conditions. These different blasting conditions included varying distances between the explosive column and the rock/paste fill interface and various positions ofthe explosive column
 in relation to the paste fill stope. The model was finally extended to include a row of explosive
 columns parallel to the face of a paste fill stope. This model was run for a variety of blasting
 patterns and delay intervals to determine their effect on damage to paste fill. The model results
 showed that the peak particle velocity and therefore the damage to the paste fill reduced for
 increased cement contents of the fill. Similar results were observed for increased solids content,
 but to a lesser extent. The model results also indicated that the order of detonation and the delay
 time between the detonation of blast holes has little effect on the damage to the paste fill.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4833/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4833/2/02Chapters1-2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4833/3/03Chapter3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4833/4/04Chapters4-5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4833/5/05Chapter6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4833/6/06Chapter7.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4833/7/07Chapter8.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4833/8/08Chapter9.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4833/9/10References.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4833/10/11AppendicesA-C.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4833/11/12AppendixD.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4833/12/13AppendixE-F.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Systematics and biostratigraphy of Australian early cretaceous belemnites with contributions to the timescale and palaeoenvironmental assessment of the early Australian early cretaceous system derived from stable isotope proxies</field><field name="creator">Williamson, Toni</field><field name="description">Belemnites are particularly common in Australian Early Cretaceous sequences
 but have attracted little contemporary examination. They offer potential for
 biostratigraphic zonation, as evaluated in the study presented here, based on an
 examination of very extensive collections that have accumulated in museum and
 university collections over more than a century. Most of these are from the Great
 Artesian Basin of eastern Australia and the Carnarvon Basin of Western Australia but
 small collections from the Maryborough Basin (coastal Queensland) and the Money
 Shoals Basin (Northern Territory) are also included in the study. Systematic revision
 has identified distinctive taxa of the Austral Family Dimitobelidae, and has
 determined their stratigraphic ranges. Contrary to the existing literature, the Aptian
 Stage is characterized by just two species: robust Peratobelus oxys Tenison-Woods
 characterized by an unusually large phragmocone, previously described under the
 name P. selheimi Tenison-Woods, and gracile P. bauhinianus Skwarko. Albian taxa
 include long-ranging Dimitobelus diptychus McCoy and D. stimulus Whitehouse but
 also the short-ranging D. plautus sp. nov. (early Albian), and D. liversidgei Etheridge
 (late Albian). Dimitobelus hendersoni sp. nov. is recognized from the Albian of Western
 Australia but its precise range is not known. A distinctive new, diminutive,
 Cenomanian belemnite genus Microbelus gen. nov. is established with two component
 species, M. haigi sp. nov. and M. tumidus sp. nov., based on collections from the West
 Australian Carnarvon Basin.
 
 Many of the belemnite guards have retained pristine biogenic calcite, free from
 diagenetic overprint, as demonstrated by the luminescence properties of polished thin
 sections examined by electron microprobe imaging and by analysis for trace element
 contents by inductively coupled plasma technology. Belemnite guards arranged in
 stratigraphic sequence for the eastern Australian Great Artesian Basin and from drill
 core from the Carnarvon Basin have been analysed for Sr-isotope contents. Strontium
 isotopic curves for these two sequences have been used for timescale resolution of the
 Australian Early Cretaceous System, by comparison with the global curve established
 from a range of northern hemisphere studies. The evaluation indicates that some
 adjustment to biostratigraphic zonations applied in Australia for timescale purposes,
 particularly that related to dinoflagellates, requires adjustment. Substantial
 paraconformities are indicated for both documented successions, embracing the
 Aptian-Albian boundary interval.
 
 Oxygen and carbon isotopic analysis has been applied to the same sample set
 examined for strontium contents, with the objective of illuminating the
 palaeoenvironmental context of Australian shallow marine environments of Early
 Cretaceous (Aptian-Cenomanian) age. The data indicate that oxygen and carbon
 isotopic systematics of epeiric association were perturbed by partial isolation from the
 global ocean. Isotope signatures for the sequence of the Great Artesian Basin reflect a
 combination of local scale influences, including dilution by riverine runoff, exchange
 with volcaniclastic sediment, unusual temperature regimes that applied in very extensive, shallow epicontinental water bodies and the peculiarities of organic
 recycling in such an environment.
 
 Oxygen-isotope values obtained from the Carnarvon Basin, representing an
 open-ocean continental margin sediment system, indicate southern hemisphere midlatitude
 late Aptian sea surface temperatures, that differ little from those which
 presently apply. A warming trend is apparent for the Albian-Cenomanian interval,
 representing greenhouse climatic conditions. Carbon-isotope values through the
 same interval show a complementary negative trend in b13C, attributed to C02
 enhancement in the atmosphere that accompanied global warming. Short period
 temperature excursions of as much as 5&#176;C are identified in the record, suggesting that
 climatic shifts of similar scale to those which characterised the Pleistocene Epoch also
 applied in the mid Cretaceous. Relative to values of b13Ccarb available from other
 studies of Albian - Cenomanian biogenic carbonate, those obtained from the
 Carnarvon Basin are unusually low, suggesting that low productivity characterised
 the water body in which its sedimentary succession accumulated through this time
 interval. The carbon-isotope record is incomplete for the intervals that should register
 oceanic anoxic episodes la (early Aptian), Ib (Aptian-Albian boundary interval) and
 Id (latest Albian). OAE Ib is expressed by a positive b13Ccarb excursion across the
 euxinic interval of the Toolebuc Formation in the Great Artesian Basin succession and
 a correlative positive excursion is apparent for the succession of the Carnarvon Basin.
 It is dated as early late Albian, - l05Ma, but its global significance is open to question.
 A matching negative excursion in b13Corg across the Toolebuc interval of the Great
 Artesian Basin is attributed to the influence of organic matter of continental
 provenance.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4906/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4906/2/02SectionA.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4906/3/03SectionB.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4906/4/04SectionC-E.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4906/5/05RefApps.pdf</field></doc></add>
